His lawyers said they would \"mount an aggressive defence\".\n\nJack Prior, one of the actor's attorneys, told the court the accusations were \"inconsistent with Mr Smollett's character\" and that the actor \"wants nothing more than to clear his name\".\n\nIf convicted, he could be sentenced to three years in prison and made to pay for the cost of the police investigation.\n\nWhat did police say?\n\nIn a news conference earlier on Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lashed out at the \"shameful\" scheme.\n\n\"Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?\" he said.\n\n\"How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?\"\n\nSupt Johnson accused Mr Smollett of taking \"advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career\".\n\nImage copyright Chicago Police Image caption CCTV image released earlier by Chicago police\n\nHe said Mr Smollett had betrayed the city of Chicago, and said \"this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve\".\n\nThe \"hoax\", he said, \"received national attention for weeks\", and may deter future hate crime victims from coming forward for fear that their allegations may be met with scepticism.\n\nHe called upon the actor \"to apologise to this city that he smeared\".\n\n\"Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor,\" said Supt Johnson, with palpable anger.\n\n\"I'm left hanging my head and asking why,\" he added, describing Mr Smollett's actions as a \"slap in the face\" to Chicagoans.\n\nWhat did Smollett's lawyers say?\n\nThey dismissed Thursday's proceedings as \"an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system\".\n\nA statement from the actor's legal team added: \"The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.\n\n\"Mr Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.\"\n\nCelebrity websites TMZ and Page Six said the actor was back on the set of Empire after the bail hearing.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Rallies were held after Mr Smollett first announced the alleged \"attack\"\n\nHow did the case unfold?\n\nThe gay actor said he had gone out to buy food late at night on 29 January from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago city centre when two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults at him.\n\nHe said they also punched him, poured a chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck.\n\nMr Smollett also claimed the men had told him \"this is Maga country\", referring to President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.\n\nAn outpouring of support followed, including from Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell.\n\nIn an interview last week with ABC's morning TV show, Mr Smollett tearfully said he had been \"forever changed\" by the alleged incident.\n\nImage copyright Gabriel Olsen Image caption Mr Smollett has been a vocal social activist for years\n\nBut suspicions mounted as police were unable to find any video footage of the incident from over 50 surveillance cameras they reviewed. There were also no witnesses.\n\nInvestigators managed to track and identify two men who appeared on video footage near where the actor said he had been attacked through a ride-sharing app.\n\nThe men - Ola and Abel Osundairo - had left the US for Nigeria following the alleged attack and were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned last week.\n\nThey were released without charges after providing information that \"shifted the trajectory of the investigation\", police said.\n\nOne of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire, a hit Fox show that depicts the lives of a music mogul and his family in Chicago.\n\nPolice say they have a cheque that Mr Smollett signed and that he had agreed to pay $3,500 for the brothers' participation.\n\nSupt Johnson said that Mr Smollett had told at least one of the brothers that he was \"dissatisfied\" with his salary from Fox.\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post, Mr Smollett was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role in Empire, which has about 18 episodes per season.\n\nImage copyright FOX via Getty Images Image caption Jussie Smollett (left) pictured in an episode of Empire\n\nInvestigators said on Thursday that some minor scrapes on Mr Smollett's face were probably self-inflicted.\n\nSupt Johnson said Mr Smollett first \"attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language\" to himself at Fox studios.\n\nPolice had confirmed in early February that white powder - later identified as aspirin - was in the letter.\n\nDuring another news conference on Thursday, police said Mr Smollett had also claimed that three days before the attack he received an unidentified phone call from a man who uttered a homophobic slur then hung up.\n\nHe told police that incident happened near a surveillance camera. It was the same camera that police say Mr Smollett would later point out to the Osundairo brothers in preparation for the alleged hoax attack.\n\nOn Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show two people buying materials, including balaclavas, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers.\n\nMr Smollett turned himself in early on Thursday.\n\nFox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which make Empire, issued a statement on Thursday saying they were \"evaluating the situation\" and \"considering our options.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Democratic White House hopefuls Cory Booker and Kamala Harris both called the incident a \"modern-day lynching\".\n\nMs Harris, a California senator, on Thursday said she was \"sad, frustrated, and disappointed\".\n\nPresident Trump tweeted his condemnation after the police news conference of Mr Smollett's \"racist and dangerous comments\"."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world/us_and_canada", "text": "How May summoned up her inner Trump for her Brexit address\n\nThe US president has enjoyed giving advice to the British leader over Brexit.

But this month, it released a nine-minute short that does just that.\n\nCalled Purl, it was released on 4 February and has already amassed six million views on YouTube. It\u2019s the story of a walking, talking ball of yarn called Purl. She\u2019s carnation pink, bubbly and eager to kick off her new desk job at the firm B.R.O. Capital.\n\nBut after her colleagues \u2013 all male \u2013 negatively react to her, she shapes herself (figuratively and literally) to be more like the hyper-masculine workers around her so she can fit in.\n\nPixar story artist Kristen Lester, who wrote and directed the short, says the film is inspired by her own experiences in the animation industry. Starting out, she was often the only woman in the room, and felt like she had to morph into \u201cone of the guys\u201d.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to risk being rejected, and so I would change to eliminate that risk,\u201d she says.\n\nThe film satirises \u201cbro culture\u201d \u2013 a term often linked to fields like tech, finance and video games which have drawn criticism for fostering macho office environments that can exclude and demean women.\n\nPurl\u2019s colleagues are stereotypical \u201cbros\u201d. They make loud, vulgar jokes, they constantly talk about hitting the gym, and rowdily leave en masse at 17:00 for all-you-can-eat wings happy hour. When Purl gleefully bounces into the office, they\u2019re dumbstruck and speechless, with no idea how to relate to her. Almost immediately, they start ignoring her in meetings, and ditch her when it\u2019s time for after-work hangouts.\n\nIt\u2019s an example of tribalism, which can be damaging to both individual workers and the companies that employ them \u00ad\u2013 when people are in an environment where everyone looks, sounds, acts and thinks the same, it can create an echo chamber and cyclical system that only includes and rewards the same kinds of people over and over. (All the photos on the \u201cemployee of the month\u201d wall at B.R.O. are of white men sporting the same grin.) Study after study has shown that more diverse teams are more innovative, more successful and make better decisions than homogenous teams do.\n\nEventually, Purl reinvents herself as a two-dimensional, defeminised caricature in a suit. She copies their behaviour to the point where she becomes one of them. She swears, she\u2019s aggressive in meetings \u2013 and she\u2019s instantly accepted. (In a montage later with the boys, she throws up strings of green yarn-vomit after a heavy session at the pub.)\n\nBetween the cursing and the on-screen regurgitating, Purl isn\u2019t typical Pixar fare. But that\u2019s exactly what Pixar has aimed to do: Purl is one of six short films in an experimental series called \u201cSparkShorts\u201d. The company gave a handful of employees of varied backgrounds six months and limited funds to make their own films based on their personal stories, allowing for more latitude and edginess.\n\nWhy depict women as balls of yarn?\n\n\u201cWe can change into whatever we want in order to negotiate a situation where we feel uncomfortable,\u201d Lester says. \u201cThis idea of shape-shifting and \u2018knitting new personas\u2019 was something I thought could be a cool metaphor.\u201d At her early jobs, Lester says she had to do little things, like self-edit her conversations around her male colleagues, to fit in. One example was avoiding referencing films that she feared were viewed as \u201ctoo girly\u201d.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be associated with those things because I felt it emphasised that I was different,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I would choose to reference movies that I knew my male coworkers had watched and liked. It got my point across, but it wasn\u2019t the movie that I had personally connected to.\u201d\n\nSome time after Purl\u2019s transformation, a new cheerfully earnest hire joins B.R.O. \u2013 a yellow yarn ball named Lacy. The bro contingent instantly crushes her own spirit and excludes her. But when Purl sees Lacy going through what she did, she drops the act and welcomes Lacy into the fold, setting an example for the others.\n\nBut the short isn\u2019t just about casual gender discrimination in the workplace \u2013 it\u2019s about general inclusion.\n\nIn the film\u2019s happy ending, the office is filled with dozens of brightly-coloured yarn balls working joyfully alongside the now-enlightened men. But there\u2019s a visual difference in the men, too: they\u2019re more racially diverse. That was no coincidence, Lester says.\n\n\u201cI wanted to portray the world as it could be. A world where people \u2013 and yarn balls \u2013 of all different shapes and sizes could work together to make something great.\u201d\n\nSince the film\u2019s release, many people have contacted Lester with their own version of Purl\u2019s story. \u201cSome of their stories are funny, some of them sad, but they are all stories of people relating to the struggles of [Purl].\u201d\n\nShe hopes people keep telling their personal stories, especially through film.\n\n\u201cBeing able to understand and empathise with a point of view not our own opens up new possibilities for us as a culture,\u201d she says. \u201cMovies have the power to create empathy for other points of view we may not have considered.\u201d\n\n--\n\nBryan Lufkin is BBC Capital's features writer.

That was a guideline notably violated by former FBI Director James Comey during his July 2016 press statement outlining the results of a federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Barack Obama's secretary of state.\n\nIt would be ironic, to say the least, if the resulting political fallout from Mr Comey's decision - which Ms Clinton's campaign believes dealt a mortal wound - is cited by Justice Department officials to defend a decision to keep confidential damaging details of the Mueller investigation involving Donald Trump.\n\nWhat will Bill Barr do?\n\nThis is the million-dollar question.\n\nIn his testimony during his January Senate confirmation hearings, Mr Barr was repeatedly pressed by Democrats to promise he would make public any findings or reports produced by the Mueller investigation.\n\nHe demurred.\n\n\"My objective and goal is to get as much as I can of the information to Congress and the public,\" he told Senator Dianne Feinstein. \"I am going to try to get the information out there consistent with these regulations and to the extent I have discretion, I will exercise that discretion to do that.\"\n\nHis answers left considerable wiggle room. He could view the Justice Department's special counsel regulations as a ceiling or a floor - a minimum requirement of disclosure that can be exceeded or a limit to what he can reveal, given confidentiality requirements and prosecutorial guidelines.\n\nSo we may not know anything?\n\nIt's certainly a possibility. Or if we do learn something, it could take a while to render it into a form for public consumption (or, given the way things work in Washington, to leak).\n\nImagine the scene in Washington, as the political world learns Mr Mueller has provided his findings to Mr Barr and then waits - for hours, days, maybe even weeks - to learn what, if anything, will come of it.\n\nThere is another possibility, however.\n\nUp until now, Mr Mueller has spoken through his court filings, which are rich in detail and new revelations. While Mr Mueller's report to the attorney general will be confidential, it may not be his final word at the conclusion of his investigations.\n\nThere may be more indictments to come.\n\nOver the course of the last 21 months, Mr Mueller - in his prosecutorial documents - has explained how Russian agents and operatives allegedly gathered information about the US political process, initiated a social media campaign to influence and enflame American political views, funded on-the-ground political activities, and hacked the emails and files of top Democratic operatives in an effort to damage Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nHe has prosecuted multiple members of the president's inner campaign circle for a variety of misdeeds, including obstruction of justice and lying about Russian contacts.\n\nHe helped strike a deal with Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, which unearthed evidence of Trump business negotiations with Russian officials conducted in the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHe indicted a Trump confidant, Roger Stone, for lying about his contacts with Wikileaks, the organisation he says was the conduit through which Russia injected its purloined material into the American political bloodstream.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe special counsel could be building a prosecutorial path that leads to the White House, with the final stones about to be set. Court-watchers note multiple sealed indictments have been filed in the federal courts used by Mr Mueller's team over the past few months. Those could be political and legal bombs, with their fuses lit.\n\nOr they could be duds.\n\nThat's it, then?\n\nHardly. Even if the Mueller investigation closes up shop and there is no \"report\", there are no new indictments and the attorney general's public pronouncements provide few details, it's not the end of the story.\n\nThere are a number of cases initiated by the special counsel - involving Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and deputy campaign aide Rick Gates - that still await final sentencing.\n\nFormer campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been jailed for fraud and awaits sentencing for crimes related to his lobbying.\n\nLong-time Trump adviser Mr Stone has yet to go to trial on his charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Mr Mueller has handed this prosecution over to government lawyers. There's also a special counsel case against Concord Management and Consulting, which Mr Mueller has charged with assisting Russia's 2016 social media election-meddling campaign.\n\nMeanwhile there's a plethora of other ongoing investigations that are being run independently of the special counsel's office. Federal investigators in New York are looking into possible election-law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses and misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee.\n\nThe US attorneys in Washington and Virginia also have their hands full, with the espionage case involving Russian Maria Butina and an unregistered foreign lobbying prosecution of Mr Flynn's business associates.\n\nThere are also state-level investigations of Mr Trump's charitable foundation and Trump Organization tax filings, as well as an ongoing lawsuit by Maryland and the District of Columbia alleging that the president, through his business dealings, is violating a constitutional rule prohibiting the acceptance of money from foreign governments while in office.\n\nMr Mueller may exit the stage, but the drama will continue."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47325381", "text": "Video\n\nThe rare phenomenon happens when light hits a waterfall tumbling down El Capitan.

Political factors that seem like mere background are actually undeniable forces that shape the vivid individuals on screen.\n\nBlunders and bad ideas have nearly overtaken the Academy Awards this year. One minute there\u2019s a host for the show, the next there is not. A popular film category was announced and quickly withdrawn amidst charges that it was condescending. And who really thinks the mediocre Bohemian Rhapsody deserves its best picture nomination? The Moonlight / La La Land debacle of 2017 is beginning to seem like a tiny mix-up by comparison. Beyond the chaos, the foreign language film category is a relief: all of this year\u2019s nominees are artistically dazzling and exert a strong emotional pull. They all give life and drama to some of the most relevant global issues of our day, from the migrant crisis and its resulting shattered families, to the guilty weight of class and history. In any given year, any one of the five would deserve to win.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Capernaum: Heart-wrenching films about childhood\n\n- The Favourite: Films that are re-writing history\n\n- How good are the best picture nominees?\n\nForeign language nominees often feature topical themes. Last year\u2019s winner, Chile\u2019s A Fantastic Woman, dealt compellingly with transgender rights. But the category usually makes way for apolitical films as well. The Great Beauty, 2014\u2019s winner, is a Fellini-esque immersion in a man\u2019s identity crisis, and Toni Erdmann, the German nominee from 2017, is a goofily comic take on a father-daughter relationship. There is nothing fanciful among this year\u2019s choices. The urgent relevance of the films as a group reflects the sombre tone of our times, in which wars, xenophobia and isolationism seem on the rise. But these films are richer than their messages alone.\n\nThe flawless artistry of Cold War, based on Pawlikowski\u2019s own parents\u2019 on-and-off romance, has nothing intrinsically to do with its Cold War setting. Shot in the richest black and white, it has the feel of a classic love story as it sweeps from Poland to Germany and Paris and back again, from 1949 to 1964. Artistic repression in Poland drove Wiktor to escape, separating him for a time from Zula. And he becomes a different man in Paris, more calculating and dissolute. It is impossible to decipher how much of the dissonance in their relationship was driven by their fiery personalities and how much by social forces beyond their control. The love story and the dark political cloud hanging over it are specific to the film\u2019s period yet feel familiar today, when quite different events - from terrorism to street violence - often create a sober sense of the world impinging on ordinary lives.\n\nAlthough aesthetically Nadine Labaki\u2019s naturalistic Capernaum, from Lebanon, is wildly different from Cold War, it also deals with cultural displacement. Its hero, Zain, is a heartbreakingly adorable boy from an impoverished family, with no birth certificate or legal documents to prove his identity. Other people guess he is about 12 years old, but he looks younger and is forced to act much older.\n\nThis year\u2019s Oscar ceremony will strain to prove the awards\u2019 relevance\n\nIn sequences of his life on the streets, shot in piercing colours and sharp detail, each quietly eloquent scene adds a layer to the social themes. Zain - played by Zain Al Rafeea, a Syrian refugee and non-professional actor, who could not be more believable - runs away from home after his sister is married off, aged 11. He is taken in by Rahil, an Ethiopian migrant who works as a cleaner without legal documents. When Rahil is suddenly taken into custody, Zain is left to care for her toddler son. He has no money but is resourceful. A Syrian girl he meets on the street leads him to a food bank for refugees, where he pretends to be Syrian so he and the boy can eat.\n\nLabaki never presses Capernaum\u2019s obvious social message too hard. Through Zain the film explores the effects of war and migration today, which apply far beyond the Middle East: homelessness, the forced separation of parents from children and the lack of a true place in the world.\n\nA boy with a makeshift family in a makeshift home is also at the centre of the Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s Shoplifters. Shota lives with his father and mother, aunt and grandmother - a family of strays, cramped together and surviving by petty theft, whose tentative connections are gradually revealed. They take in a small girl who has been neglected, an adopted sister Shota protects as fiercely as Zain did his own sister and the toddler in his care. Kore-eda\u2019s tone, unsentimental and non-judgmental, only strengthens the film\u2019s power as it deftly entices viewers into Shota\u2019s world, where the father teaches the boy how to steal. Shoplifters is not overtly political, but then pilfering for survival is a social comment in itself.\n\nLike Shoplifters, all the foreign language film nominees are concerned with family. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma deserves the extravagant praise it has already received for its emotional story, based on the director\u2019s memories of his boyhood in Mexico in the early 1970s. The heroine is the nanny and maid, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio, another non-professional actor, who has earned an Oscar nomination for the role). Politics is not the most obvious element in this extraordinary film, shot in wide-screen, grey-toned black and white, and from a neutral perspective that allows us to observe events as if they were memories of our own. But social upheavals and class divisions are inseparable from the story.\n\nCuar\u00f3n delicately outlines the dynamics between the middle-class employers and their servant. She watches television with the family in the evening, until she is asked to bring the father some tea.\n\nPolitical unrest simmers in the background. A paramilitary band marches on the street. That political layer explodes in a sequence in which the grandmother of the family takes the pregnant Cleo to buy a cot, another indication of their attitude toward her: affection with a hint of noblesse oblige.\n\nFrom the window of the furniture shop, on the street below, the women see a demonstration now known as the Corpus Christi massacre, in which right-wing militia shot and killed pro-democracy student demonstrators. One of the gunmen chases a protestor into the furniture store, shooting him as Cleo and the grandmother watch, a shock that sends Cleo into labour.\n\nRoma\u2019s triumph would be another indication that foreign language films are now speaking to a global audience\n\nCuar\u00f3n himself has acknowledged how important the political layer of Roma is, telling The Hollywood Reporter that he saw a newspaper clipping about the massacre when he was 10 years old. \u201cMy little middle-class bubble burst,\u201d he said. In the film, \"I wanted to explore the wounds that shape me, both personal and wounds that I share collectively with a country and with the world\u2026 This society has not changed.\"\n\nFlorian Henckel von Donnersmarck\u2019s ambitious, elegantly realised Never Look Away examines how the dark political forces of Nazism shaped personal lives and art, and how those wounds of history reach into the present. The film is based loosely on the life of the artist Gerhard Richter, but it is nothing like a potted biopic. At the start the hero, Kurt, is a small boy in the 1930s, taken by his beloved aunt to the Nazi\u2019s Degenerate Art exhibition (where work by innovative artists including Kandinsky and Chagall were shown as examples of decadence).\n\nWith epic range, sumptuous visuals, and a captivating story, Never Look Away follows Kurt\u2019s life and progress as an artist through to West Berlin in the 1960s. His aunt, emotionally unstable and considered defective by the Nazis, is put to death. As a young man at art school, Kurt falls in love with Ellie, whose father is a doctor trying to hide his Nazi past. The film spans a changing society, in scenes of wartime bombing and of post-war middle-class ease. And it richly includes many styles of art, vibrantly captured by the cinematographer Caleb Deschanel. Rejecting the social realism forced on him in post-war East Germany, Kurt and Ellie escape to West Berlin, where he can create original art, from abstraction to photorealism. Like the couple in Cold War, Kurt and Ellie\u2019s love and lives are shadowed by political forces.\n\nVon Donnersmarck\u2019s The Lives of Others, about the Stasi\u2019s surveillance of artists in the 1980s, won the best foreign language film Oscar in 2007. It may resonate even more strongly now, when the possibilities for intrusions into privacy are on the rise. Similarly, Never Look Away sends a chill from the past that applies to any hint of artistic repression today, and any recent outbreak of neo-Nazism.\n\nThis weekend\u2019s Oscar ceremony will strain to prove the awards\u2019 relevance, assuming that this will be signalled by higher ratings for the show or blockbusters in the best picture category. A genuine sign of relevance though, is tucked away in these foreign language films, which speak so brilliantly to the world\u2019s most pressing problems, while depicting timeless romances and family bonds.\n\nRoma is heavily favoured to break out of the foreign category and take best picture, making history as the first non-English-language winner of the biggest prize. If it does - as it should - that triumph would be another indication that foreign language films are now speaking to a global audience. The world may be fraught with divisions, but these five films are transcendent.\n\nLove film?

Although the old man was sitting cross-legged on the concrete floor, his wiry Balinese frame took on the characteristics of a belligerent bantam fighting cock.\n\n\u201cHe used to be known as a real tough guy,\u201d his nephew Wisnu smiled. \u201cHe was famous as a martial arts expert and could break coconuts in half with his hand.\u201d\n\nKolok Getar pointed at a row of palms that were swaying in the hilltop breeze. His gnarled fingers formed the shape of a large sphere and he delivered a vicious chop to the imaginary coconut. The circle of friends seated on the floor around him broke into applause. Apart from their bursts of laughter (and Wisnu\u2019s translations into Indonesian for my benefit), the entire conversation had taken place without a word being uttered.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Why no-one speaks Indonesia\u2019s language\n\n\u2022 The language the French forbade\n\n\u2022 The Indian tribe that deals in venom\n\nKata Kolok, literally meaning \u2018deaf talk\u2019 in Indonesian, is a unique sign language that is currently the primary means of communication for just 44 people on the entire planet. For about six generations, an unusually large proportion of Bengkala\u2019s population has been born deaf \u2013 something that locals for many years attributed to a curse, but which scientists have more recently pinned down to a recessive gene (known as DFNB3) that over the decades has resulted in about one in 50 babies in this community being born deaf. But in many ways these people \u2013 all deaf from birth and referred to as \u2018kolok\u2019 (deaf) by their fellow villagers \u2013 are more fortunate than deaf people in other areas. That\u2019s because more than half of the hearing people in the highland village of Bengkala have also learned Kata Kolok, solely for the benefit of communicating with deaf family members and friends.\n\nVery few tourists make the two-hour drive from the tourist centre of Ubud over the volcanoes to the coastal hinterlands of north Bali, which remain one of the poorest parts of the island. Most of the kolok in Bengkala carve a subsistence living from farming or labouring, but traditionally have also been hired by their fellow villagers as security guards and gravediggers. Today, as Kolok Getar relives his martial arts glory days, he and his friends are waiting for a funeral that is scheduled to happen at the Pura Dalem (Death Temple) on the outskirts of Bengkala.\n\nIf it\u2019s your destiny to be born deaf, then this would very likely be the best place in the world to grow up\n\n\u201cWhen my uncle was younger, he toured the island making a small living by giving martial arts demonstrations,\u201d Wisnu translated as Kolok Getar continued his story in a whirl of karate-chop hand signs. \u201cHe met many deaf people but could hardly communicate with them, because, if they knew sign language at all, it was a different version [from the one used in Bengkala]. Those deaf people were often lonely because they could only talk with one or two members of their close family.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, the kolok of Bengkala are relatively fortunate. They\u2019re able to communicate with a large proportion of people in this 3,000-strong, close-knit village.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s your destiny to be born deaf,\u201d said I Ketut Kanta, spokesman for Bengkala\u2019s Deaf Alliance, \u201cthen this would very likely be the best place in the world to grow up!\u201d\n\nHearing people are known as \u2018enget\u2019, and no matter where you are in the village you will often come across mixed groups of kolok and enget all chatting in what they call \u2018deaf talk\u2019. Whether you\u2019re visiting the primary school, at the central temple or sipping sweet black kopi (coffee) at Pak Suparda\u2019s little warung (stall), you\u2019re likely to see deaf and hearing people in animated but silent conversation, or jostling each other with boisterous laughter.\n\nThe signs in Kata Kolok are often so surprisingly obvious that even a new arrival will understand: the sign for \u2018male\u2019, for example, is a rigidly pointing index finger, while the sign for \u2018father\u2019 is the same finger curved across the top lip like a moustache. \u2018Woman\u2019 is denoted with two fingers forming a narrow opening, while \u2018mother\u2019 is a cupped breast. \u2018Thirsty\u2019 is shown by the stroking of an apparently parched throat, and \u2018coffee\u2019 is a finger twisting against the forehead in the same manner that is used to denote a crazy person in the West.\n\nKata Kolok has evolved naturally and is constantly being added to by the most imaginative and garrulous among the village\u2019s signers. A side-effect of this is that this village seems to have more than its share of talented and highly energetic actors. The most effervescent of the Kata Kolok communicators bring a joyful mood of laughter and slapstick that seems to be a powerful bonding tool between the deaf and the hearing.\n\n\u201cKolok and enget are paid equal rates for work in the village,\u201d I Ketut Kanta told me. \u201cNevertheless, it isn\u2019t easy for deaf people to find a job outside the village, and it is sometimes hard to get by here on local labour wages of about US$5 a day.\u201d\n\nHowever, today Kolok Getar and his four kolok friends are fortunate: they\u2019ve been hired to dig a grave. Balinese Hindus typically cremate their dead, but it is an expensive ceremony. So, as is common here, I Nyoman Widiarsa\u2019s sons must bury their father while they save for the costs of a cremation.\n\nA Balinese funeral is often unnerving to Western sensibilities since (outwardly at least) it appears often to be an almost joyous affair. The Balinese believe that if the spirit of the dead person senses grief among his family members, he may have second thoughts about moving on to the next life. That\u2019s why the ceremony takes place with the same sort of light-hearted chatter with which the Balinese seem to do everything.\n\nThey have a reputation for being tough and fearless\n\nThat means that the clowning and prancing of Kolok Getar and his grave-digging colleague Kolok Sudarma at the graveside was not considered inappropriate. Even the close family laughed along. They lowered the body carefully into the hole and Kolok Sudarma climbed down into the grave to place the mirrors in position back on the corpse\u2019s eyes. These mirrors are said to guarantee that the deceased will be reborn with clear vision in the next life. (Interestingly, there is no similar ritual for the ears).\n\n\u201cHearing people used to say that the koloks could communicate with the evil spirits that haunt graveyards,\u201d Wisnu told me, \u201cbut the truth is that they simply have a reputation for being tough and fearless.\u201d\n\nSome Bengkala villagers claim their deaf friends are immune to the spooky noises \u2013 whispers from the grave and evil spirits \u2013 that \u2018haunt\u2019 hearing people. Others point out that manual labour and a need to fend for themselves when they leave the village has given rise to the kolok toughness. Whatever the reason, there is a noticeable level of respect in the village for the kolok community, and several villagers have set out to champion their cause.\n\nI Ketut Kanta gives free Kata Kolok lessons to children. Connie de Vos, a Dutch researcher from the Centre for Language Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, has visited many times over the course of the last decade and helped I Ketut Kanta lobby for the inclusion of kolok children in the local school and for Kata Kolok lessons for hearing children. The village also has a craft centre, called KEM, where several kolok women are employed to produce woven textiles on traditional handlooms. The centre also attracts occasional tourist groups who come to watch kolok martial arts as well as a specially choreographed dance known as Janger Kolok, which has become locally famous and is even performed at hotels and government conferences throughout the region.\n\nLinguists have established that the Kata Kolok language, like their unique dance, has little in common with other sign languages.\n\n\u201cKata Kolok has very little influence from either Indonesian or Balinese spoken language or from sign languages outside the village,\u201d said Hannah Lutzenberger, a PhD candidate at Radboud University who is fluent in Kata Kolok after four long stints in the village. \u201cAn insight into the richness of Kata Kolok can be derived from the name signs for deaf individuals,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll kolok are known by name signs. Because this is a vibrant signing community, these names are usually given by deaf peers relatively early in life but they can change throughout a lifetime. They usually relate either to appearance or to a personal habit.\u201d\n\nKolok Getar, for example, is known by a forward-pointing hand held in front of the mouth. It might look like a beak, but, by the time I\u2019ve crossed paths with him several times in Bengkala\u2019s narrow streets, I\u2019ve noticed him adopt that same posture frequently as he acts out the martial arts glories of his younger years. I realise that this action will for all time remind me of this cheerful man.\n\nWhile he\u2019s forgotten many of his martial arts skills, Kolok Getar is still respected in the area, even at 78 years old. He\u2019s been given the responsibility for the maintenance of the water pipes, which in this arid northern part of the island is quite literally the lifeblood of his community. When there\u2019s a broken pipe, it\u2019s his job to travel up into the hills to find the break. Often the cause turns out to be people from a neighbouring village who \u2018poached\u2019 the water for their own use.\n\n\u201cI try never to use violence when I catch them,\u201d the old man signed, with such a tough and determined look that I nod my head in energetic agreement, \u201cbut I don\u2019t need to, because people around here know that you don\u2019t tangle with a kolok\u2026 It\u2019s an unspoken rule.\u201d\n\nOur Unique World is a BBC Travel series that celebrates what makes us different and distinctive by exploring offbeat subcultures and obscure communities around the globe.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

But that was the hunch of George Porter Phillips in the early 20th Century.\n\nAs he walked the wards of London\u2019s notorious Bethlem Royal Hospital, Phillips had observed that his patients with melancholia often suffered from severe constipation, along with other signs of a \u201cgeneral clogging of the metabolic processes\u201d \u2013 including brittle nails, lustreless hair and a sallow complexion.\n\nThe natural assumption might have been that the depression had led to those physiological problems, but Phillips wondered if the arrow of causation instead pointed in the other direction. By targeting the gut, could you ease the melancholia?\n\nTo find out, he fed the patients a reduced diet devoid of all meats, except fish. He also offered them a fermented milk drink known as kefir, which contains the lactobacillus bacteria, a \u201cfriendly\u201d microbe that was already known to ease digestion.\n\nAmazingly, it worked. Of the 18 patients Phillips tested, 11 were cured completely, with two others showing significant improvement \u2013 offering some of the first evidence that our gut bacteria can have a profound influence over our mental wellbeing.\n\nIf you like this, you may also enjoy:\n\nBBC Future\u2019s Microbes and Me series has now examined various claims about the power of our gut microbiota to harm or heal \u2013 but the notion that they could be responsible for our mental health is perhaps the most difficult to behold. How could these microscopic scavengers, feeding on the debris of our digestion, possibly affect the brain?\n\nAs we have seen with the other articles in this series, some of these findings have been overhyped. But more than a century after Phillips\u2019 initial experiment, the fundamental idea of a gut-brain axis is now remarkably solid. \u201cThere is no debate, in my mind, that microbes influence mental health,\u201d says Jane Allyson Foster, whose lab at McMaster University in Canada is leading research in this area. And that means we may be able to heal the brain through the belly. \u201cThere is the potential both for the development of novel therapeutics and for precision medicine.\u201d\n\nFoster emphasises that an unhealthy gut is just one of many possible causes of mental illness, meaning that only a subset of patients will respond well to the new \u201cpsychobiotic\u201d treatments. But for those patients who are suffering from an imbalance in their gut bacteria, the new therapies might bring much-needed relief.\n\nDespite early studies, including Phillips\u2019, the idea that the gut might influence our mental health fell out of favour for much of the 20th Century, and strong evidence for this mysterious link has only emerged again over the last two decades.\n\nOne of the most striking modern experiments came from Kyushu University in Japan in 2004.\n\nThe team first demonstrated that \u201cgermfree\u201d mice \u2013 raised in sterilised conditions so they have no microbes on or in their bodies \u2013 showed greater fluctuations in the hormones corticosterone and ACTH, both of which are known to reflect stress levels. This suggested that the gut bacteria of healthy mice were somehow shaping their hormonal profile.\n\nWhat was remarkable was that the animals that receive the \u2018depressed\u2019 microbiome, behave depressed - Julio Licinio\n\nThe researchers then dosed a group of germfree mice with lactobacillus bacteria \u2013 the class of \u2018friendly\u2019 bacteria that Phillips had also used on his melancholic patients. Although these mice still showed a higher stress response than the mice that had never been raised germ-free, their stress responses were less pronounced than the mice without any gut microbes.\n\nThere are even some signs that depressive behaviours can be transmitted across species \u2013 from human to mouse \u2013 through the microbes in the gut.\n\nIn one study, Chinese researchers in Chongqing took a sample of the gut microbiota from patients with Major Depressive Disorder and planted them in germfree mice. These mice subsequently were quicker to quit, on a \"forced\" swimming task \u2013 a behaviour that is often considered to be analogous to the lethargy and hopelessness found in depression. And when the mice were placed in a box, they spent less time exploring the central areas and instead stayed closer to the edge, where they felt more secure.\n\n\u201cWhat was remarkable was that the animals that receive the \u2018depressed\u2019 microbiome, behave depressed,\u201d says Julio Licinio at New York Upstate Medical University, who was a co-author on the paper. \u201cIf you change the microbiome, you change the behaviour.\u201d\n\nWe can only draw so many conclusions from these animal studies, of course \u2013 but their conclusions are supported by epidemiological studies examining vast numbers of human participants (the most recent was published on 4 February 2019.) These studies have consistently shown that differences in the gut microbiota coincide with various mental illnesses, include depression and anxiety.\n\nNo single species appears to be responsible for these effects; instead, it appears to be the overall ratio of the different families of the microbes that matters, with the gut microbiomes of depressed and anxious people showing less overall diversity than individuals without mental health problems.\n\nAstonishingly, one of Licinio\u2019s recent papers has revealed that schizophrenia is associated with an impoverished gut microbiota, and when samples from patients were implanted in germ-free mice, it seemed to lead to some of the characteristic shifts in brain activity that are the signatures of the disorder.\n\nMultiple pathways\n\nThese effects may arise through many pathways.\n\nCertain species of gut microbes can protect the gut wall \u2013 helping to maintain its mucous membrane that stops the contents spilling into the blood stream. Without that barrier, you may suffer from a \u201cleaky gut\u201d, which triggers, among other things, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteins that increase the blood flow around sites of infection and regulate the body\u2019s immune response.\n\nWhile this reaction is crucial to fight infection, these cytokines can also lead to a low mood and lethargy. It\u2019s the reason we often feel tired when we\u2019re ill \u2013 and over the short term, that response helps us to preserve energy to find the infection. But over the long term, it may lead to depression.\n\nStress can itself increase inflammation, for instance, which can then affect the microbes in our gut\n\nGut microbes also influence how we digest and metabolise the precursors of important neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Our gut flora even has a direct line of communication to the brain, through the vagus nerve, which has receptors near the gut lining that allow it to keep a check on our digestion. Microbes in the intestine can therefore release chemical messengers that alter the signalling of the vagus nerve \u2013 and, as a consequence, the brain\u2019s activity. (To find out more about the vagus nerve, read Gaia Vince\u2019s explainer over at Mosaic.) \u201cLocally in the gut, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for the bacteria to communicate with the host systems \u2013 including the nervous system,\u201d says Foster. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dynamic, interactive, rich space.\u201d\n\nThese pathways are not one-way streets however, so brain activity can also influence the gut flora composition. Stress can itself increase inflammation, for instance, which can then affect the microbes in our gut. The result could be a kind of feedback loop.\n\nNew avenues\n\nFoster says research in this field is now rapidly accelerating, conducted both by university scientists and commercial companies; academic meetings, discussing the findings, are now \u201cdime-a-dozen every week\u201d.\n\nUltimately, these researchers hope that their findings will offer a new treatment target for illnesses such as depression.\n\nExisting antidepressants aim to alter the balance of chemicals such as serotonin in the brain, but they are not effective for all patients: only two out of every 10 patients taking antidepressant drugs show signs of improvement, over and above the placebo effect. And although they help many patients, talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are similarly hit and miss. As a result, many patients are left without and struggle to find an appropriate treatment, and the gut-brain axis would seem to offer one of the most promising lines of enquiry.\n\nSome attempts \u2013 like Phillips\u2019 study in 1910 \u2013 have fed patients fermented drinks such as kefir that might seed the gut with bacteria and proteins that are known to be beneficial to digestion, or soluble fibres known as \u201cprebiotics\u201d that are also thought to encourage our gut flora to flourish. Unfortunately, many of these studies have tended to be small, with only a handful of participants, and their results have been mixed: in some studies, the interventions successfully reduced symptoms; in other trials, they proved to be no better than a placebo treatment.\n\nOne explanation, Foster says, is that the failed studies have not targeted the patients who would benefit most from this kind of treatment. There are many causes of depression, after all, and while disruptions to the gut flora may be the underlying cause of some people\u2019s depression or anxiety, in others the trigger could be quite different. For them, a probiotic drink is unlikely to make a big difference to their symptoms.\n\nTo further complicate matters, each person\u2019s microbiome is unique \u2013 so any treatment that targets the gut flora should take account of those differences. Overall, the exact composition between any two individuals only overlaps by around 10%.\n\nFor this reason, she thinks we need to find more sophisticated ways of matching the treatment to the patient. \u201cThis is where the gut-brain axis is going to help us, in precision medicine.\u201d The hope, Foster says, is \u201cto map out \u2018bio-types\u2019 or clusters of individuals who share the biology that might be driving their symptoms\u201d. You might, for instance, first test whether a patient has high or low inflammation before deciding on the treatment.\n\nIn one study from Spain, people eating the traditional Mediterranean diet were roughly half as likely to be diagnosed with depression over a four-year period\n\nLicinio is also cautiously optimistic that future research will identify therapies that target the gut-brain axis. He says that the significant side-effects of antidepressant drugs have limited the development of new pharmaceutical treatments \u2013 but this approach could avoid those issues. \u201cYou are not tampering with the brain,\u201d he says, \u201cso I think that any side effects you have will be less problematic.\u201d\n\nEat like an Italian\n\nThe current understanding of the gut-brain axis does at least add to the growing evidence that a healthy, balanced diet could be an important preventative measure to reduce the risk of developing an illness like depression in the first place.\n\nMany of these studies have examined the \u201cMediterranean diet\u201d \u2013 a catch-all term to describe diets rich in vegetables, fruit, nuts, sea food, and unsaturated fats and vegetable oils, and low in refined sugar and red and processed meat. (This is a very rough generalisation, of course, since there is still a great variation in the particular foods eaten across southern Europe.) In one study from Spain, people eating the traditional Mediterranean diet were roughly half as likely to be diagnosed with depression over a four-year period.\n\n\u201cThe data regarding the importance of nutrition for mental and brain health is now extensive and highly consistent,\u201d says Felice Jacka, a nutritional psychiatrist at Deakin University in Australia and author of Brain Changer: The Good Mental Health Diet. Although there are many potential mechanisms, the Mediterranean diet has been shown to increase the diversity of gut bacteria, and reduces the other physiological changes such as chronic inflammation that also seems to accompany depression.\n\nMore than a century after Phillips\u2019 experiment in Bethlem Royal Hospital, a panacea for depression remains elusive \u2013 but for some people at least, a healthier gut may be an important first step to a healthier and happier mind.\n\n--\n\nDavid Robson is a senior journalist at BBC Future.

Thousands of unfamiliar words, an entirely different grammatical structure and the high potential for embarrassment are enough to intimidate many of us. With a busy work life, finding the time to commit to a new language can be a challenge in itself.\n\nBut experts agree that it\u2019s more than possible to make meaningful progress in just one hour a day. Not only that, the skills gained from practicing a new language can feel like superpowers in the workplace and beyond.\n\nResearch shows there is a direct correlation between bilingualism and intelligence, memory skills and higher academic achievement. As the brain more efficiently processes information, it is even able to stave off age-related cognitive decline.\n\nDepending on your native tongue and which new language you\u2019re learning, you can develop a diverse toolkit of both short-term and lifelong cognitive benefits. Of course, the further apart the language the tougher the challenge (think Dutch and Vietnamese), but focusing on a specific application can drastically narrow the practice time.\n\nWhether it\u2019s for a new job, for literary competence or for making casual conversation, you can sharpen language skills no matter your age or previous exposure.\n\nThe most difficult languages\n\nThe US Foreign Service Institute (FSI) divides languages into four tiers of difficulty for native English speakers to learn. Group 1, the easiest of the bunch, includes French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish and Swahili. According to FSI research, it takes around 480 hours of practice to reach basic fluency in all Group 1 languages.\n\nThe US Foreign Service Institute divides languages into four tiers of difficulty. The easiest take around 480 hours of practice to reach basic fluency\n\nThe difficulty begins to spike as we move down the list. It takes 720 hours to achieve the same level of fluency in Group 2 languages, which include Bulgarian, Burmese, Greek, Hindi, Persian and Urdu. More difficult are Amharic, Cambodian, Czech, Finnish and Hebrew, which places them in in Group 3. Group 4 is comprised of some of the most challenging languages for English speakers to grasp: Arabic, Chinese, Japanese and Korean.\n\nDespite the daunting timeframe, experts say it\u2019s worth learning a second language for the cognitive benefits alone. Doing so naturally develops our executive functions, \u201cthe high-level ability to flexibly manipulate and utilise information, and hold information in the mind and suppress irrelevant information,\u201d says Julie Fiez, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s department of neuroscience. \u201cIt\u2019s called executive functions because it\u2019s thought of as skills of a CEO: managing a bunch of people, juggling a lot of information, multitasking, prioritising.\u201d\n\nBilingual brains rely on executive functions \u2013 things like inhibitory control, working memory and cognitive flexibility \u2013 to maintain balance between two languages, according to a study from Northwestern University. Because both language systems are always active and competing, the brain\u2019s control mechanisms are constantly strengthened.\n\nLisa Meneghetti, a data analyst from Treviso, Italy, is a hyperpolyglot, meaning she is fluent in six or more languages - in her case English, French, Swedish, Spanish, Russian and Italian. When embarking on a new language, especially one with a lower difficulty curve that requires less cognitive stamina, she says her biggest challenge is to avoid mixing words.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal for the brain to switch and use shortcuts,\u201d she says. \u201cThis happens more often and more easily with languages that belong to the same family\u2026 because the similarities are great but so are the false friends!\u201d\n\nThe best way to avoid this issue, Meneghetti says, is to learn one language at a time, and to differentiate the linguistic families.\n\nAn hour of difference\n\nLearning the basics of any language is a quick task. Programmes like Duolingo or Rosetta Stone can guide you through a few greetings and simple phrases at lightning speed. For a more personal experience, polyglot Timothy Doner recommends reading and watching material that you already have an interest in.\n\n\u201cIf you like cooking, buy a cookbook in a foreign language; if you like soccer, try watching a foreign game,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re only picking up a handful of words per day - and the vast majority continue to sound like gibberish - they will be easier to recall later on.\u201d\n\nBefore you go too far, however, it\u2019s important to consider exactly how you plan to use the language in the future. And which language you learn depends on your personal motivations, says Beverly Baker, an associate professor and director of language assessment at the University of Ottawa.\n\n\u201cA busy professional might see Mandarin as important to learn because they have business contacts, or it could be a language your family spoke and you lost, or you\u2019re in love with someone who spoke that language\u201d, she says. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just interested in saying a few things to your in-laws.\u201d\n\nOnce your intentions for the new language are defined, you can begin planning out a productive hourly schedule for daily practice\n\nOnce your intentions for the new language are defined, you can begin planning out a productive hourly schedule for daily practice that includes multiple learning methods.\n\nAdvice on how to best spend this time varies depending on which polyglot or linguistics expert you\u2019re speaking to. But there\u2019s one tip they all seem to stand behind: devote at least half of your hour to stepping away from the books and videos to practice with a speaker face to face, be it someone who's native or highly fluent in the language. \u201cTo go over questions and do activities, to talk together in the language, and to discuss the culture,\u201d Baker says. \u201cI would not skip that part, because learning about the people and culture will motivate me to keep up with the rest of my learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdults, some of them do their language learning trying to memorise words and practice pronunciation, all in silence and to themselves. They don\u2019t actually take the leap to try and have a conversation actually using the language,\u201d Fiez says. \u201cYou\u2019re not really learning another language, you\u2019re just learning picture-sound associations.\u201d\n\nJust like exercise or musical instruments, people recommend a shorter amount of practice time on a regular basis rather than larger chunks on a more sporadic basis. Baker says this is because without a consistent schedule the brain fails to engage in any deep cognitive processes, like making connections between new knowledge and your previous learning. \u201cAn hour a day five days a week is therefore going to be more beneficial than a five-hour blitz once a week.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FSI index, it would take 96 weeks at this pace to achieve basic fluency in a Group 1 language, or nearly two years. But by following the advice from experts, narrowing down your lessons for specific applications rather than general fluency, new speakers will be able to shave off significant time towards reaching their desired level.\n\nIQ and EQ\n\n\u201cLearning a second language can satisfy an immediate need but it will also help you become a more understanding and empathic person by opening the doors to a different way of thinking and feeling,\u201d says Meneghetti. \u201cIt\u2019s about IQ and EQ combined.\u201d\n\nCommunicating and empathising across language barriers can lead to a high-demand skill called \u2018intercultural competence\u2019. According to Baker, intercultural competence is the ability to build successful relationships with a variety of people from other cultures.\n\nDedicating one hour of your day towards learning a new language can be thought of as practice in bridging gaps between people. The result is a more malleable communication skillset that brings you closer to your peers at work, home or abroad.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re faced with a different worldview with someone from a different culture. You don\u2019t rush to judgment and are more effective at resolving the clashes in the world that come up,\u201d Baker says.\n\n\u201cJust learning one language, any language in any culture, helps you to develop that adaptability and flexibility when faced with other cultures, period.\u201d\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

And his personal style \u2013 the uniform dark suits, matching shades and the ponytail \u2013 made Karl Lagerfeld instantly recognisable.\n\nBut how will the German designer be remembered? He didn\u2019t so much have a distinctive look or design as an impact that hit home. Today, fashion shows arguably have grown larger than the collections they showcase \u2013 and none of these shows were bigger than Lagerfeld\u2019s spectacles at the Grand Palais in Paris.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The women behind Christian Dior\n\n- The rebirth of the grand fashion houses\n\n- Karl Lagerfeld: Behind the mask\n\n\u201cNothing \u2018defined his style\u2019 because he was a chameleon who changed his colours according to the house for which he was designing,\u201d Valerie Steele, director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, tells BBC Culture. \u201cAs he said once, he was Miss Chanel, Miss Fendi, Miss Chlo\u00e9, (even, perhaps, Miss Lagerfeld) \u2013 with different styles for each.\u201d\n\nLagerfeld worked for multiple fashion houses over the years, and at the time of his death at the age of 85, he was the creative director of both Chanel and Fendi, and also ran his own label.\n\nHis career began in the 1950s, when, alongside another great, Yves Saint Laurent, he won a prestigious fashion award now known as the International Woolmark Prize. He soon became the assistant to one of the judges that year, Pierre Balmain, and his rise through the Paris fashion world continued with a series of legendary French brands, including the now defunct fashion arm of Jean Patou and Chlo\u00e9.\n\nLagerfeld reached his peak serving as the creative director of Chanel \u2013 a role he continued for 36 years. Taking the reins just over a decade after the death of founder and namesake Coco Chanel, he revived the fading brand by introducing ready-to-wear and combining a nod to the house\u2019s tweedy, sporty, women-in-trousers heritage, adding modern and even futuristic touches.\n\nBut in the words of The New York Times fashion director and chief fashion critic Vanessa Friedman, it was not for creating his own silhouette - unlike some of his contemporaries.\n\n\u201cHe was variously referred to as a \u2018genius\u2019 the \u2018Kaiser\u2019 and \u2018overrated\u2019\u201d, she wrote. \u201cHis contribution to fashion was not in creating a new silhouette, as designers like Cristobal Balenciaga, Christian Dior and Coco Chanel herself did. Rather, he created a new kind of designer: the shape-shifter. That is to say, the creative force who lands at the top of a heritage brand and reinvents it by identifying its sartorial semiology and then wresting it into the present with a healthy dose of disrespect and a dollop of pop culture.\u201d\n\nHere are some of Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s iconic fashion moments.\n\nKarl and Yves\n\nUnknown at that time, Karl Lagerfeld in 1954, launched his fashion career proper by winning a prestigious fashion prize organised by the International Wool Secretary. It got him his first job assisting judge and designer Pierre Balmain, and it also made him a great new friend, fellow winner, Yves Saint Laurent.\n\n\u201cWithout Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld, the world of fashion is less colourful, seductive, inventive and, yes, brash and naughty. What a loss,\u201d mutual friend of both designers Madison Cox tells BBC Culture.\n\nSkirting controversy\n\nMary Quant may have become famous for creating the mini skirt, but Karl Lagerfeld (shown here in 1960), caused controversy by creating the shortest skirts of the season for his then employer, the French brand Jean Patou. His early collections may have courted attention, but they were not always well received. His first collection for the brand Curiel in 1969 was described by one critic as having \u201cdrippy, drapey elegance.\u201d\n\nAdult entertainment\n\nMore controversy, when Lagerfeld\u2019s Spring collection for Fendi in1993 used an Italian adult entertainment star to model his black-and-white collections. American Vogue Editor Anna Wintour walked out of the Milan show when Moana Pozzi appeared as a model. The pair subsequently reconciled, and Wintour later presented Lagerfeld with the Neiman Marcus Award for Distinguished Service in the Field of Fashion. She called him \u201ca kind, loyal and constant friend\u201d.\n\nLittle black jacket\n\nAn entire book has been written on the re-designing and styling Chanel\u2019s iconic black jacket. And Lagerfeld\u2019s reworking of the jacket will be one of the revamps he will remain best known for during his time at the label. In the book, The Little Black Jacket, Lagerfeld and French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld joined forces to present 21 photographs of celebrities, styled by Roitfeld, wearing the legendary garment.\n\nWedding with a twist\n\nIn January 2013, Lagerfeld closed his traditional haute couture show with the customary wedding dress, but worn by two women holding hands to show his support of same sex marriage, specifically referencing a controversial French marriage law that had led protesters to take to the streets of Paris. Lagerfeld\u2019s \u2018wedding-with-a-twist theme\u2019 for the couture show was set inside a forest of trees planted inside the Grand Palais.\n\nSupermarket chic\n\nLagerfeld was known for creating epic fashion shows inside the Grand Palais for Paris Fashion Week. One of the most memorable in recent memory was the Womenswear Autumn/Winter 2014-2015 catwalk, when he turned the Grand Palais into a Chanel-themed supermarket. It was his way of making luxury seem more compatible with everyday life.\n\nFashion as protest\n\nLagerfeld often embraced the zeitgeist with his collections. His Spring/Summer 2015 womenswear show reflected on feminism and protest, with models marching through the Grand Palais bearing placards. Their slogans included \u2018History is Her Story\u2019 and \u2018Ladies First\u2019.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

T. rex could reach more than 3.5m tall as measured at the hip.\n\nBut, as co-author Lindsay Zanno, from North Carolina State University, explained, it wasn't always this way: \"Early in their evolution, tyrannosaurs hunted in the shadows of archaic lineages such as allosaurs that were already established at the top of the food chain,\" she said.\n\nOur understanding of the evolutionary events leading up to the appearance of giant tyrannosaurs has been limited by the lack of complete fossils in North America.\n\nSmall-ish, primitive tyrannosaurs have been found in North America dating from the Jurassic Period (around 150 million years ago). By around 81 million years ago, North American tyrannosaurs had become enormous beasts. But the fossil record in between these two time periods is patchy.\n\nThe lower leg bones of the new species, Moros intrepidus, were discovered in the same area where Dr Zanno and her team had previously found Siats meekerorum, a giant meat-eating dinosaur belonging to a group known as the carcharodontosaurs. This larger predator lived during the same period as Moros.\n\nThe researchers estimate that Moros intrepidus was about the size of a modern mule deer, weighing about 78kg. It was seven years old when it died and was almost fully grown.\n\nAlthough it was comparatively lightweight, it was probably very fast on its feet. \"These adaptations, together with advanced sensory capabilities, are the mark of a formidable predator. It could easily have run down prey, while avoiding confrontation with the top predators of the day,\" said Dr Zanno.\n\n\"Although the earliest Cretaceous tyrannosaurs were small, their predatory specialisations meant that they were primed to take advantage of new opportunities when warming temperatures, rising sea-level and shrinking ranges restructured ecosystems at the beginning of the Late Cretaceous.\n\n\"We now know it took them less than 15 million years to rise to power.\"\n\nThe scientific paper, published in the journal Communications Biology, makes the case that these environmental changes may have led to the decline of the allosaurs - the apex predators that reigned until the emergence of big tyrannosaurs.\n\nAn analysis of Moros' place on the family tree of tyrannosaurs appears to suggest that the group may have migrated to North America from Asia.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://bbc.com/news/stories-47307275", "text": "On death row in Malawi, Byson Kaula was nearly executed three times - but on each occasion the hangman stopped work before hanging all the prisoners on his list. So he survived\u2026 until the country stopped executing people altogether.\n\nByson Kaula says jealous neighbours were responsible for him being found guilty of murder. It was 1992 and murder in those days carried a mandatory death sentence.\n\nBrought up in a small village in southern Malawi, Byson had made enough money working in the gas industry in Johannesburg, South Africa, to return home and buy land. He employed five people and grew fruit, wheat, maize, and cassava.\n\n\"That is when my sad times began,\" he says.\n\nNeighbours attacked one of his employees, Byson says, leaving him badly injured. The man couldn't walk without assistance, and while helping him get to the toilet - navigating steps that were slippery after heavy rain - Byson fell and dropped him. The man died later in hospital, and Byson - then in his 40s - was charged with murder.\n\nIn court, Byson's neighbours testified against him.\n\nHis mother, Lucy, sitting at the back of the courtroom, couldn't hear the sentence being read out and had to ask what was happening. When she was told he had been sentenced to death, \"tears rolled from my eyes down my chest,\" she says.\n\nThis was towards the end of the totalitarian government of Hastings Banda, which had controlled the country since 1964. Byson vividly remembers the horror of waiting for his turn at what he calls \"the killing machine\".\n\n\"When I was told: 'You can go now to the condemned section waiting for your time to be hanged' - oh, I felt as if I was already dead.\"\n\nAt that time, there was just one executioner - a South African who travelled between several countries in the region, carrying out hangings. When he arrived in Malawi, once every couple of months, the prisoners on death row knew that time, for some of them, had run out.\n\nOne day Byson remembers being told that his name was on the list of 21 people to be hanged within hours. A guard told him that executions would begin at 13:00 and that he should \"just start praying\".\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to Life After Death Row, on Assignment, on the BBC World Service, on 21 February\n\nClick here for transmission times, or to listen online\n\nThey continued until 15:00, when the executioner stopped work.

And on that day, I understand he said: 'No it's too much, I'll come again next month,'\" Byson says.\n\nThe same thing happened twice more, Byson says. The list was drawn up, but the hangman didn't finish it - and each time, by chance, Byson was among those left alive at the end of the day. On the third occasion, all the prisoners on the list were executed except him, he says.\n\nIn a way he was lucky, but the experience took its toll on him and he attempted suicide twice - only to survive this too.\n\nAfter the establishment of multi-party democracy in Malawi in 1994, all executions came to a halt. The death sentence is still given out, even today, but no president has signed a death warrant for 25 years. Prisoners either languish on death row for years or have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nIn time, Byson was moved from death row to the main part of Zomba Central Prison, and it looked as though he would spend the rest of his life there. He became heavily involved in the prison education programme, both studying and teaching. But he had no hope of ever being released.\n\nThen, in 2007, a historic case changed everything.\n\nA drug user who admitted killing his stepson, but argued that he had been temporarily insane, went to court to challenge the mandatory death sentence for murder. He argued that this breached the right to a fair trial, and the right to protection from \"inhuman and degrading treatment\" - both guaranteed by Malawi's constitution - and the court agreed. In some cases of murder the perpetrator was more culpable than others, it ruled, and there should therefore be different levels of punishment.\n\nThis meant that all mandatory death sentences had to be reviewed.\n\nOf nearly 170 prisoners eligible for resentencing, 139 have so far been released. According to the legal charity Reprieve, many had mental health problems or were intellectually disabled. More than half of those entitled to a new hearing turned out to have no court record at all - it was unclear why they were even in prison.\n\nWhen lawyers said that they wanted to take Byson back to court he initially resisted, as he had been so terrified by his first experience. But he gave in, and when the judge told him he was free to leave immediately, he was stunned.\n\n\"The prison warders said can you get out of the accused box. But I couldn't stand up. I was just shivering, all my body was so weak\u2026 It was just as if I was dreaming. I could not believe what the judge had said.\"\n\nByson wasn't the only person whose life had been changed by his sentence.\n\nHis mother Lucy had visited every year during his incarceration. She would save her earnings from a year's work farming cotton to make the journey to the prison in Zomba, bringing Byson as many provisions as she could carry.\n\nOn the day of Byson's resentencing in 2015, she wasn't there, but her younger son was. When he rang to tell her the news, she took a while to believe what he was saying. Then, she says, she \"jumped around like a lamb - a young lamb\u2026 my heart was filled with joy\".\n\nByson was taken to a halfway house to help him learn new skills and make the transition back to normal life after 23 years in prison. Already in his 60s, he was the oldest person they'd ever had there.\n\nHe now goes back as a volunteer at weekends, to advise other ex-prisoners who are going through the same experience.\n\nImage caption Byson has plans for those bricks\n\nThe land Byson used to farm is now overgrown. His wife died during the long years he was in prison and his six children have grown up and moved away.\n\nHe lives alone, but takes good care of his mother, now in her 80s.\n\n\"During my imprisonment, all I was worrying about was my mother\u2026 Being her first-born, I would do everything possible for her. Now that I'm back, I don't let her go farming or do hard jobs. I have got other people to do the jobs for her. She doesn't go to the field. I do it myself.\"\n\nHis next project is to build her a new brick house.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nJust over a year ago, Greek pilot Vasileios Vasileiou checked into a luxury hilltop hotel in Kabul.

It placed tariffs of up to 25.5% to counteract the alleged dumping and an additional duty of up to 27.02% to counter what Washington deemed were unfair subsidies from the European Union.\n\nAccording to ASEMESA, exports of black olives have fallen by 60% since the tariffs were imposed.\n\nSpain is the world's largest olive producer and exporter: the country exported $67.6m (\u00a352.4m) worth of olives to the US in 2017 before any tariffs were put in place.\n\n\"If the customs duties remain, we will certainly lose the majority of the US black olive market,\" says Mr De Mora.\n\nFarmers against each other\n\nIn January, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union's trade commissioner, petitioned the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address this matter.\n\nShe said in a tweet these tariffs were \"unjustified, unwarranted and go against the rules\" of the WTO.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\n\nThe original complaint came from two California-based olive producers, Bell-Carter Foods Inc and Musco Family Olive Co. The companies claimed that Spanish growers were selling their olives at 70% below their true market value.\n\nCalifornia is the main olive growing state in the US with a climate similar to the Mediterranean. For nearly a century the US industry focused on \"ripe olives\" - the black olives that Americans typically use on pizza and in salads.\n\nBut in the late 1990s, many farmers began to switch to producing olive oil.\n\nAccording to Sam Israelit, owner of Spanish Oaks Ranch in central California, many farmers switched because olive oil generated more value per-tonne than the ripe fruit.\n\n\"Consumers are willing to pay $20-25 for a good bottle of olive oil - and table olives just don't get that margin.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Most Californian olive farms focus on olive oil, allowing Spanish producers to dominate the ripe olive market\n\nThis switch allowed Spanish producers to become even more dominant in the US - and left Bell-Carter Foods and Musco Family Olive as the only two major producers of US table olives.\n\nBigger battle\n\nIn the summer of 2017, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced his department would investigate the claims of olive dumping.\n\nUnder President Trump's administration, the number of investigations into unfair trade practices has risen significantly.\n\nAccording to the US Commerce Department, 137 new investigations into claims of dumping and subsidies had been opened by the end of 2018. That's an increase of more than 300% compared to the number of investigations undertaken in the first two years of the Obama administration.\n\nBut some say the tariffs on olives and other products are just a smoke screen to go after the wider global trade system, which President Trump and his supporters have called \"rigged\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption US President Donald Trump and former Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy met in Washington in 2017\n\n\"Olives for me are a pretext,\" says Tomas Garcia Azcarate, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council. He says the US is using the olive duties as a way to attack the EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) which gives subsidies to farmers.\n\n\"The economic consequence [to olives] is not the most important element here, this is a test case,\" says Mr Garcia Azcarate.\n\nAntonio De Mora and ASEMESA argue Spanish producers can sell their products at such low prices because of technological efficiencies and not government subsidies.\n\nBut the potential consequences to the EU's CAP are what some say held Cecilia Malmstrom and the EU from bringing this case to the WTO sooner.\n\nSteve Suppan, senior policy analyst for the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, says Europe regards this as a \"stalking horse for an attack on the CAP\" and the effects could \"undermine the support that the EU gives its farmers\".\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\n\nIf Europe loses the olive fight it could open the doors to challenges against other agricultural products.\n\nAll this comes as the US and EU prepare to thrash out a free trade deal of their own. US producers would like to see agriculture included in negotiations but so far EU officials have refused to include it.\n\nWhat now?\n\nThe US and EU have 60 days to negotiate a settlement over the Spanish olives. If no deal is reached then the EU could ask a panel of WTO judges to make a ruling.\n\nEven here there is a catch: the US has been blocking the appointment of judges to the WTO's appellate body, the world's top trade court. There are just three judges left on that panel, which usually has seven.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Some argue this battle is part of larger US efforts to break down the WTO\n\nThe US has accused WTO judges of overreaching and violating procedures. But some countries say this is part of a larger effort to break down the WTO which US President Trump has called \"the worst deal ever made\".\n\nThat has left Spanish olive growers feeling like pawns. Without other markets to replace their US sales, many of these farmers may be left as casualties of a broader battle to reshape global trade."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-47297644", "text": "Video\n\nWriter Josh Barry has cerebral palsy and has spent the past nine years writing a book about his life with his nose.\n\nBecause of his limited mobility and speech he previously used an array of switches connected to a computer - or would dictate to a scribe - but says he started using his nose to type on the keyboard of an iPad so that he could be more creative.\n\nJosh, who is from East Cowes on the Isle of Wight, works as a freelance journalist and runs an entertainment website where he has interviewed celebrities including Sir Ian Botham and Jeremy Kyle.\n\nHe says he wants to \"raise awareness of other people in my situation who despite being different, can achieve their dreams and aspirations\".\n\nVideo journalist: James Warwick"}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/england/hampshire", "text": "More councils drop weekly bin collections\n\nAt least 10 authorities switched to fortnightly rounds or announced plans to do so in the past year."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47325431", "text": "Panda-monium!!\n\nThese panda cubs in Toronto Zoo look pretty clumsy don't they?

We believe carbon-rich (C-type) asteroids may have significant amounts of water locked up in their rocks.

A detailed analysis will now be done. \u2014 HAYABUSA2@JAXA (@haya2e_jaxa) February 22, 2019 Report\n\nHayabusa-2 had earlier dropped a small, reflective, beanbag-like \"target marker\" on to Ryugu. This was used as a guide as the spacecraft descended to the rough surface of the asteroid.\n\nControllers were aiming for the centre of a circle, some 6m in diameter, located about 4-5m away from the target marker.\n\nThe Japanese space agency (Jaxa) had originally planned to carry out the touchdown operation in October last year. But the asteroid's surface was found to be much more rugged than expected, with numerous, hefty boulders making it hard to find a location that was large and flat enough to sample.\n\nControllers had hoped they would have an area of about 100m in diameter to target. But because of the surface properties, this had to be reduced to a 6m circle for what team members are calling a \"pinpoint touchdown\".\n\nThe sampler horn that extends out from the bottom of the spacecraft has a length of 1m. It's therefore vital that there are no boulders more than 50cm in height at the landing site, to reduce the chances that the body of the spacecraft could hit a rock.\n\nImage copyright Jaxa Image caption The sampler horn will be used to collect material for delivery to Earth in 2020\n\nUnexpected surface properties also have the potential to affect the amount of material collected. Before arriving at Ryugu, researchers had expected the surface to be covered in a powdery layer of fine-grained material - the regolith.\n\nIn fact, the upper layer turned out to be akin to gravel, consisting of rocky chunks that are centimetre-sized or larger.\n\nProf Fitzsimmons told BBC News: \"This was a surprise, as other near-Earth asteroids we have visited previously have shown areas dominated by small particles.\n\n\"It might be due to the carbon-rich composition, as the previous NEAs are composed of silicate rock, which are more Earth-like. But the shape of Ryugu also implies it was spinning much faster in the past, so it's possible this could have affected the particles' sizes in some fashion.\"\n\nScientists carried out additional tests in Japan to determine whether the sample material could still be gathered by the spacecraft.\n\nThey used a container of artificial gravel with a similar size distribution to that on Ryugu. In a vacuum chamber, they fired a tantalum bullet identical to that used by Hayabusa-2 into the gravel.\n\nAccording to Jaxa, the results of the test exceeded expectations, with the tantalum projectile yielding fragments of rock in size ranges that should easily pass through the sampler horn.\n\nThis suggests that Hayabusa-2 should have been able to collect a sample.\n\nIn September, Hayabusa-2 deployed two robotic \"hoppers\" that propelled themselves across the surface of Ryugu, sending back images and other data.\n\nThen, in October, the \"mothership\" despatched a French-German instrument package called Mascot to the surface.\n\nLater this year, perhaps in March or April, Jaxa plans to detonate an explosive charge that will punch a crater into the surface of Ryugu.\n\nHayabusa-2 would then descend into the crater to collect fresh samples of material that have not been altered by aeons of exposure to space.\n\n\"We know that the surfaces of asteroids are changed over time by bombardment with energetic particles from the Sun and interstellar space,\" said Alan Fitzsimmons.\n\n\"Yet studies with telescopes show that this 'space weathering' affects the surfaces of carbon-rich asteroids differently to those mostly made from more rock-like silicate minerals. We don't know why this is, and the fresh sub-surface samples from Ruygu will play a very important role in understanding how this happens.\"\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-47319788", "text": "Image copyright Michael Tullberg Image caption Tork was diagnosed with a rare form of tongue cancer in 2009\n\nPeter Tork, a member of the made-for-TV pop group The Monkees, has died at the age of 77.\n\n\"There are no words right now... heartbroken over the loss of my Monkee brother Peter Tork,\" bandmate Micky Dolenz tweeted.\n\nTork, who played keyboard and bass for the group, was diagnosed with a rare form of tongue cancer in 2009.\n\nThe Monkees were huge in the 1960s, with hits like I'm A Believer and Daydream Believer.\n\nA post on Tork's official Facebook page said \"the devastating news\" was being shared \"with beyond-heavy and broken hearts\".\n\nIt said: \"Our friend, mentor, teacher, and amazing soul, Peter Tork, has passed from this world.\"\n\nA message posted on the band's official Twitter page said that Tork had \"passed peacefully\" and invited fans to share their favourite memories by adding their comments.\n\nThe family later released a statement in which they said they were \"saddened\" by Tork's death, but \"grateful\" for the \"attentive energy and dedication of Peter's fans worldwide\".\n\n\"Peter's energy, intelligence, silliness and curiosity were traits that for decades brought laughter and enjoyment to millions, including those of us closest to him.\n\n\"We ask that our family have time and space to grieve in privacy,\" it added.\n\nTork's contemporary, Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, tweeted:\n\nSkip Twitter post by @BrianWilsonLive I\u2019m sad to hear about Peter Tork passing.

But when his friends nearly died he thought again, says the BBC's Sue Mitchell.\n\nAzis Hanna, his wife Maryam, and their five-year-old daughter, Chia, arrived in Dunkirk in October and made more than 20 attempts to reach the UK before finally succeeding last weekend, in the back of a lorry.\n\nFor a while he had considered making the trip in an inflatable rubber boat. The smugglers made it sound quite safe, promising that one of them would travel in the boat with the migrants for 14 miles.\n\n\"When you go to English water they then call the police, the police come to help take you to England. Every smuggler says like this,\" Azis says.\n\nAt this point the smugglers themselves would travel back to France in an accompanying boat, the story went.\n\nBut the experiences of two friends from the Dunkirk camp filled Azis with horror.\n\nIranian Christians Bahador and Shoku, together with their children Maryam and Brinyamin, were driven to a beach south of the ferry port one winter morning and climbed into a small boat with six others.\n\nAbout 15 minutes after setting off, it capsized - and there were no life jackets. Seven-year-old Maryam says she was one of the only ones who could swim.\n\n\"This water was so cold, so much cold.

They said we were going to die.\"\n\nEventually they were rescued but both children had to be treated in hospital for hypothermia.\n\nImage caption Bahador and his children, Brinyamin and Maryam\n\nThe other story that put Azis off the boat crossing involved his friend Solomon, and Solomon's partner, Siree, both also Iranian Christians.\n\nThey had already been at sea for hours when their engine failed. As efforts were made to restart it, the boat began to fill with a mixture of salt water and fuel - which burned their skin.\n\n\"Our skin was burning, just so painful. We were just scared. Somebody was crying, someone was praying. The boat was drifting,\" Solomon says.\n\n\"We were asking God, 'Why, what is happening to us? Why?' Me too, I ask God, 'Why God you take me from Iran to this sea to die here? Nobody knows where I am.' Three hours after our engine went off we were still at sea.\"\n\nIt was dark when a small boat - British, Solomon thinks - picked them up and transferred them to a French vessel, and they were taken to a hospital in France.\n\nImage caption Bahador's son, Brinyamin, at the camp in Dunkirk\n\nAfter hearing these stories, Azis told smugglers in Dunkirk that he wanted to make the journey by lorry. His mother borrowed \u00a310,000, using her house as security, and paid the money to the smugglers' associates in Iraq. Then a long series of failed attempts began.\n\nSometimes they were found by sniffer dogs at the French ports. On other occasions, the lorries set off in the wrong direction, heading into France towards Spain or Romania. On one occasion they climbed into a refrigerated lorry, but Chia could not stand the cold and started feeling unwell.\n\nAzis says the French police took a relaxed attitude if they caught him, often wishing him better luck next time.\n\nHis successful crossing took place on Saturday. They were called by the smugglers during the day and travelled by bus from Dunkirk to a lorry park in Belgium. There they were put in the back of a Romanian lorry with another family and entered the UK via the Eurotunnel. They stayed hidden until Northampton, when they created a disturbance and the surprised driver let them out.\n\nTackling smugglers\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDCI Neil Cripps of the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit says investigators sometimes have to allow unsafe boats to set off in order to gather evidence against the smugglers.\n\n\"To get our best evidence and to do a long-term permanent disruption to this crime route, we have to balance and juggle an element of risk to people.\"\n\nAn Iraqi Kurd smuggler operating in northern France, using the name Johno, says he spent four years in jail for human trafficking - then returned to the illegal business after his release.\n\nThey hid in woods until one of Azis's cousins, who is already living in the UK, could pick them up. Hours later, Azis reported to a police station to start his claim for asylum.\n\nAzis says life in Iraq had become dangerous for him because of an earlier attempt to reach the UK as a teenager, 15 years ago. On that occasion his travelling companion had died, as he jumped from a slowly moving lorry. Years later the man's uncle contacted Azis out of the blue, blaming him for the tragedy, he says, and threatening to kill his daughter if he failed to pay \u00a350,000 in compensation.\n\nAzis did not think of staying in France, because he speaks English, has relatives in the UK, and because the UK government helps refugees, he says. \"They give houses and everything,\" he says. \"In France it isn't like that. They do help, but nothing like that.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I am overjoyed and thank God for this. England is like heaven to me.

She will be very clever and maybe even a doctor.\"\n\nImage caption British volunteer Rob Lawrie with Azis's daughter, Chia, in Dunkirk\n\nDCI Neil Cripps of the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit says increased vigilance at ferry ports, and the increased risk of getting caught when travelling by lorry, is making sea crossings more attractive for migrants.\n\n\"I am predicting, probably in the spring when the weather becomes calmer, that dinghies will start to increase,\" he says.\n\nDespite his family's disastrous experience, Azis's friend, Bahador, is one of those thinking of attempting the boat crossing again.\n\n\"We want to get away from here,\" he says.\n\n\"And we cannot come back to Iran because I am a Christian and would definitely die.

But have you considered how your weekly shop can change the world?\n\nFor BBC Radio 5 Live's Cool Planet season, I wanted to find out how making small changes to our grocery choices can have a big impact on the planet, so I went shopping with Professor Mike Berners-Lee from Lancaster University who specialises in climate change and sustainable food systems.\n\nMeat and fish\n\nWe don't eat meat in our house but I'm well aware that most people do. Think of the average weekday dinner - grilled chicken breasts, sausage and mash, spaghetti Bolognese.\n\nProfessor Berners-Lee says: \"I'm afraid to say that beef is the world's highest carbon meat of them all.\"\n\nHe says chicken is better for the environment, but adds \"it's still true to say that all meats are a less efficient way of doing agriculture than humans eating plant-based food.\"\n\nWhat about fish? Professor Berners-Lee suggests asking a fishmonger for a sustainable variety and limiting fish to one or two small portions a week.\n\nIf you can't bear the thought of being vegetarian, don't worry - cutting down is a great start. Going meat-free just one day a week can have a huge impact - research published in 2018 showed that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than a half if we all only ate one portion of red meat a week.\n\nFruit and vegetables\n\n\"Fruit and vegetables are almost always good sustainable foods\", says Professor Berners-Lee, \"but there are some exceptions.\n\n\"If a piece of fruit or a vegetable is out of season you have to ask yourself how did it get here?\n\n\"If it looks like it has a good robust skin on it like a pineapple or apple or an orange or banana, then it will have gone on a boat which is much cheaper and it has about a hundredth of the carbon footprint of putting it on an aeroplane which burns through hundreds of tonnes of fuel for one flight.\"\n\nIf you can't be without strawberries or raspberries in winter, then Professor Berners-Lee says: \"By far the best thing you can do is buy them frozen and they're still delicious. Sometimes people think surely that's a really high carbon footprint because of the refrigeration - it turns out not to be that big a deal.\"\n\nI love tender stem broccoli and have always assumed that it's the same as regular broccoli - but actually, Professor Berners-Lee says the particular vegetable has a high carbon footprint: \"It will have been air freighted in, usually all the way from Kenya,\" he says.\n\nFlowers\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nAnd if like me, you love popping a bunch of flowers in your trolley to brighten up winter days, roses or lilies will have either been hot-housed or flown in, or possibly both. You could buy a potted plant or wait until spring and buy some wonderful British daffodils.\n\nProfessor Mike Berners-Lee's golden rules:\n\nFor the biggest impact, eat less meat and dairy. It's the least efficient way to take on protein and causes the bulk of food's carbon footprint. If you don't want to go totally meat-free, choose sustainable non-farmed fish and chicken over lamb and beef\n\nEat everything you buy! Check your fridge before you go shopping and don't be tempted by deals\n\nThe more fruit and veg you eat, the better, but just make sure if it's not in season, it's robust enough to have arrived by boat.

On Wednesday he demonstrated why he will be a formidable candidate.\n\nIn 24 hours the Vermont senator amassed $6m (\u00a34.6m) in small-dollar campaign contributions from more than 225,000 supporters.\n\nThat number dwarfs the rest of the Democratic field, including the previously impressive $1.5m mark California Senator Kamala Harris brought in from 35,000 donors in her first day as an official candidate.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"We're going to win\": Bernie Sanders on what's different this time\n\nMr Sanders' fundraising prowess shouldn't come as a huge surprise, however.\n\nIn 2016 he raised $228m, which allowed him to compete on equal financial footing against Democratic establishment favourite Hillary Clinton. During that campaign he compiled a list of millions of donors.

But since 1986, Vietnam has opened up its economy and its growth has been one of the fastest in Asia - the World Bank says its GDP growth rate could reach 6.6% this year.\n\nAnd the Vietnamese Communist party has done this while retaining absolute power.\n\nIt allows no opposition groups, maintains \"absolute and direct leadership\" over the army and the police and has conducted, says human rights group Amnesty International, a \"relentless crackdown on dissent\".\n\nVietnam ranks just above North Korea at the bottom of the 2018 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders.\n\nBut hosting such a major summit is certainly a sign that Vietnam has come a long way since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. A booming economy and prominent global role with no let-up on social controls may well appeal to Mr Kim.\n\nJudging from comments on Vietnamese social media, most people are proud of their country being chosen to host the summit.\n\nAmong them is Le Dang Doanh, a former adviser to the prime minister who has conducted extensive research on how Vietnam's transition could help North Korea. He has twice met visiting North Korean delegates.\n\nThere may be stark differences, the veteran economist told the BBC, \"but Vietnam's experience in private sector development, foreign investment attraction and deeper international integration may be helpful to North Korea\".\n\nStart with the farm\n\nVietnam's success story may has been long touted as an example for isolated North Korea, but there is little evidence that Kim Jong-un's late father, Kim Jong-il, ever took the idea seriously. He never, for example, visited Vietnam.\n\nBut Kim Jong-un has shown signs of being more open to change.\n\nImage copyright KCNA Image caption Economic growth has been a top priority\n\nSince he took over in 2011, there have been limited reforms in the agricultural sector, for example, allowing farmers to keep some of what they harvest.\n\nAnd last April, Mr Kim claimed that as North Korea had successfully achieved nuclear capability, it could now focus on improving living standards.\n\nVietnamese experts like Le Dang Doanh say there are some parallels between Vietnam in its early transition and North Korea today.\n\nLike North Korea, Vietnam knows the impact of trade embargos. Although Vietnam overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime in 1978, its subsequent occupation in Cambodia for the next 11 years gave the US grounds to pressure the IMF and the World Bank to deny Vietnam aid.\n\nAnd like North Korea under Mr Kim, isolated Vietnam started its change with grassroots reforms in collectivised agriculture.\n\n\"Before reform, Vietnam used to import one million tons of rice a year, but we are now an important rice and agricultural exporter,\" Mr Doanh said.\n\nVietnam went on to set up a foreign investment law, normalise its relationship with the world and privatise many of its state-owned corporations. American President Bill Clinton lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam in 1994, and one year later, Vietnam joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). It became a WTO member in 2007.\n\nNorth Korea could learn from this pragmatic gradualism, says Vu Minh Khuong, a Vietnamese academic at National University of Singapore and an economic adviser to Vietnam's current prime minister.\n\nHe told the BBC that North Korea could follow by focusing at first on reforming its infrastructure and institutions, and perhaps by setting out a bold vision.\n\n\"Vietnam has set out the aspiration to become a developed nation by 2045,\" said Mr Khuong.\n\n\"This vision is expected to become a powerful force to advance the country forwards at rapid pace in the years to come.\"\n\nKeeping everyone on board\n\nOf course, there are limits to what North Korea can achieve in the short term.\n\nFor a start, unless Washington and Pyongyang agree on what denuclearisation means and start work on it, there will be no lifting of sanctions so it will be difficult for foreign investors to even consider North Korea.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Ho Chi Minh remains a revered figure across Vietnam\n\nAnd Mr Kim would also need to convince North Korea's elite that opening up is a triumph of his long-term policies, not a capitulation to market forces.\n\nIn this regard, Vietnam will be instructive.\n\nOpening the economy has gone alongside a reassertion of the Communist Party's primacy and its heroic past. In 1991, as the Soviet Union was crumbling and Vietnam had to adjust to a new reality, Ho Chi Minh's Thought became one of the country's guiding ideologies, along with Marxism-Leninism.\n\nAnd while discussions of a multi-party system are strictly forbidden, Vietnamese people have enjoyed greater freedom in their economic, religious and social lives.\n\nForeign travel, especially to neighbouring countries, has become common. There is a contradictory co-existence between an official media censorship and an unofficial lively discourse on Facebook.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Vietnamese people may have more economic freedom but access to media is heavily controlled\n\nIt is unclear if or when this delicate combination of tight political control and social relaxation can be applied in North Korea.\n\nStill, if Kim Jong-un wants to follow a model of economic reform with limited political liberalisation, Vietnam, due to its size, may be a more relevant example than, say, China.\n\n\"Vietnam has learned how to pursue a multi-directional foreign policy, to avoid being dependent on one economy, and to build modern systems in financing and banking,\" said Le Dang Doanh.\n\nHe added that if North Korea is serious about change, there were also less positive lessons to learn.\n\n\"What Vietnam has not done so well in managing the natural resources and fighting corruption may also be useful for North Korea,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that in his meetings with North Korean officials, they've been keen to ask whether there had been internal conflicts among Vietnamese leaders about their reforms, and how Vietnam managed this, which may give a clue to one of the biggest challenges to North Korean change."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47226987", "text": "Image copyright Fergus Walsh Image caption Janet Osborne hopes to continue gardening if her sight loss is halted\n\nA woman from Oxford has become the first person in the world to have gene therapy to try to halt the most common form of blindness in the Western world.\n\nSurgeons injected a synthetic gene into the back of Janet Osborne's eye in a bid to prevent more cells from dying.\n\nIt is the first treatment to target the underlying genetic cause of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n\nAbout 600,000 people in the UK are affected by AMD, of whom 350,000 are severely sight impaired.\n\nJanet Osborne told BBC News: \"I find it difficult to recognise faces with my left eye because my central vision is blurred -

Over the past three months, as the movement has appeared more radical, its wider support has dipped.\n\nVincent Duclert believes that the movement does bear some responsibility for the extremist abuse in its midst, because the violence of the protests - towards the police, state institutions and public property - encourages anti-Semitism by encouraging \"transgression\".\n\nAnd, he says, it's possible that the gilets jaunes are also offering \"a new space for different kinds of anti-Semitism to come together: from the extreme right and extreme left, but also from radical Islamist or anti-Zionist groups, and some types of social conservatives\".\n\nThere are signs over the past year, he says, that levels of anti-Semitism have risen within these different groups, because of changes at home, across Europe and in the Middle East, and that French public opinion has been too tolerant.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Marine Le Pen is among those trying to court the support of the protesters\n\nPoliticians here have been quick to condemn Saturday's attack on Alain Finkielkraut.

Of course, Facebook will resist such allegations with customary vigour.\n\nIn this blog, I will analyse some of the key areas on which the select committee has reported.\n\nFacebook violations\n\nSelect committee sessions used to be more genteel affairs, with civility and good manners to the fore. The incursion of television cameras, and the collapse of many other traditional forms of democratic scrutiny (including the refusal of many politicians to do sit-down interviews on TV) have changed all that, giving them spice and influence they previously lacked.\n\nThis inquiry got testy at times - particularly because of the unconventionally brazen approach of Brexit donor Arron Banks and his associate Andy Wigmore (more of which below).\n\nThere was also heat because of Mark Zuckerberg's refusal to show up, despite repeated invitations, which angered the committee.\n\nTheir assessment of Facebook's failings is unsparing and brutal. They say the company was willing to \"override its users' privacy settings in order to transfer data to some app developers\". This is eerily redolent of the central charge in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the data of tens of millions of users ended up with an academic who wasn't supposed to have such access.\n\nIf it is true that Facebook registered the privacy settings of some users but was willing to \"override\" them, that would be a grave matter, and indicate a fundamental breach of trust.\n\nFacebook will therefore want to prove the allegation is false swiftly.\n\nFacebook's head of UK public policy said: \"We share the committee's concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence.\"\n\nThe committee also says that in charging \"high prices in advertising to some developers, for the exchange of data, and starv[ing] other developers... contributing to them losing their business\", Facebook was acting in an anti-competitive way.\n\nThis goes to the heart of Facebook's business model - and extraordinary economic power. Facebook always insists it doesn't sell user data. But the astonishing technology Mark Zuckerberg pioneered paints a digital target on users by analysing their behaviour, predicting future behaviour and sharing aspects of this analysis with advertisers who want to target particular groups.\n\nThe scandals of recent years have made the public much more aware of how this is happening. This report will fortify public awareness of the core transaction between Facebook and its users - one the company has been more open about in recent times, by the way, while also becoming much more transparent in sharing information with users.\n\nElectoral Law\n\nAh, transparency. Up to a point, Lord Copper.\n\nIt was a senior civil servant at the Home Office who used the phrase \"not fit for purpose\" about that department, but when Labour's John Reid deployed it, it became common parlance. The select committee deploys this phrase in reference to electoral law and political advertising.\n\nClear micro-targeting of voters, of the kind deployed in US presidential elections from 2008 until now, and also in the Brexit referendum, brings with it the profound danger that people outside a polity can interfere in an election. The extent of Russian interference in the election of Trump is currently being investigated. This committee wants an independent investigation into similar influence here. And it makes plain the fact that current electoral law is too weak at dealing with this new threat.\n\nThe recommendation for a new legal definition of digital campaigning and online political advertising is an attempt to wrench laws pertaining to electoral advertising from the era of leaflets and billboards to that of Facebook and Twitter. It is obvious such a wrench is necessary. It is not obvious what that new legal definition will be, because advertising and messaging come in an almost infinite number of forms.\n\nCambridge Analytica\n\nWith exquisite timing, Brittany Kaiser, a former employee of the British data firm that collapsed last year, has been subpoenaed by the Mueller Inquiry. Kaiser appeared alongside Arron Banks at the launch of Leave.EU, the alternative Brexit campaign set up by the UKIP donor.\n\nThe relationship between Banks and the committee has turned nasty. Banks is openly attacking the chairman, Damian Collins MP, in his constituency, and released a sarcastic response to the report yesterday.\n\nThere are inquiries already under way, by the Electoral Commission and National Crime Agency, into Banks's finances and the origin of his donation. Banks denies all wrongdoing. This final report doesn't go much further than it did at the interim stage in criticising Banks, but it does repeat calls for further investigation (by the National Crime Agency) of SCL Elections, a company to which Cambridge Analytica was associated.\n\nMost significantly, the report notes that many of the individuals and practices found in SCL Elections and its associates have reformed under new corporate structures, including Emerdata Ltd.\n\nA new code of ethics\n\nWill a few companies based mostly around San Francisco obey, and take seriously, a code of ethics set up by Britain?\n\nThis recommendation in the report, which is close to that made by Dame Frances Cairncross in her recent review of the future of high-quality news, derives force from the suggestion that any such code should be overseen by an independent regulator.\n\nIf regulation of the internet were easy, it would have happened a while ago. Regulation is slow and consensual; it is the very nature of technological innovation that it is fast and unpredictable.\n\nIs this a new regulator - Ofnet? Or is it part of an old one - Ofcom? I don't think Ofcom are too keen.\n\nWhat will it regulate? Social media? OK - is Snapchat social media? They say they're a camera and communication company. What about a platform for OAPs in the Swindon area set up by a local computer whizz? Will that be subject to the same rules as Facebook?\n\nAnd how do you keep up with the volume of content generated by two billion users?\n\nNone of which is in any way to argue against regulation, of course.\n\nI have read the relevant section of the report twice. On page 14, under points 31 and 32, there is reference to the views of Sharon White, CEO of Ofcom, about what could be learned from broadcasting regulation. Under point 34, on page 15, there is also the suggestion of Guy Parker, CEO of the Advertising Standards Authority, that the government could decide online harms should be added to the purview of his organisation.\n\nThe report then alights on the notion that a body called the UK Council for Internet Safety - of which Facebook is a member - could, perhaps, expand its remit to consider the \"risk to democracy\".\n\nOf all the sections of the report, this seems to me to be the area that is still not fully developed. There is extensive detail on what a new code of ethics would look like, but the granular particulars of what counts as a \"tech company\", and what the definition of \"harm\" is, remain unclear. Again, that is not to argue against regulation, merely to point out the great difficulties.\n\nA new world\n\nPut together with the recommendations of the Cairncross Review and a recent speech by Labour's Tom Watson, this report shows that we are entering a new era in the relationship between technology and the law - but we don't know what it looks like yet.\n\nThe committee has done some significant intellectual heavy lifting, and applied scrutiny to companies and individuals who often evade it.\n\nBut such is the nature of digital technology that really this marks neither the beginning nor the end, but rather the end of the beginning, of a conversation between legislators, technologists and the public about how to put the astonishing power of these innovations to better use.\n\nIn other words, how to shift power from Big Tech back to citizens. Which, after all, is what Big Tech always claimed to be about."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20190220-how-can-a-distracted-generation-learn-anything", "text": "Today\u2019s students have a problem, and it\u2019s not the one written on the board. They\u2019re so accustomed to constant stimuli from smartphone apps and streaming platforms that they can\u2019t concentrate in class.\n\nGenerations Z (ages 10-24) and Alpha (ages 0-9) were born into a world where algorithms keep them clicking, scrolling and swiping at a frenetic pace.\n\nNow teachers have a problem too: how do you adapt the traditional curriculum to accommodate students raised by technology and is there a price for compromising on traditional education?\n\nAttention, please\n\nEarly brain development is a complex topic, but over the last few years researchers around the world have raised concerns about the impact of smartphones and media multi-tasking on concentration.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing body of evidence \u2013 that is, yes, not fully validated and can be argued against \u2013 but pretty clear evidence that technology, social media, immediate access to the internet and smartphones are hurting kids\u2019 ability to focus,\u201d says Dr Jim Taylor, author of Raising Generation Tech. \u201cWe are fundamentally changing the way kids think and the way their brains develop.\u201d\n\nTeachers have noticed too. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem! The average teen has the attention span of about 28 seconds to begin with,\u201d says Laura Schad, who teaches seventh and eighth graders (ages 12-14) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She says that while smartphones have clearly affected her students\u2019 developing brains, training on how to tackle the issue is lacking: how education should evolve for digital-native students was not covered when she qualified in 2015.\n\nTech\u2019s effects are clearest in the most traditional school task, reading, especially as kids migrate from text-based digital media to image-heavy apps like Instagram and Snapchat.\n\n\u201cStudents, now, seem to find it particularly exhausting to read complex or long text without regular breaks. In the past, students seemed to be accustomed to attending to a text for a longer period of time,\u201d says Erica Swift, sixth-grade teacher at Herman Leimbach Elementary in Sacramento, California, not far from Silicon Valley. \u201cYou see their lack of stamina in them asking for breaks, talking to others instead of working, and even some just giving up on longer reading tasks.\u201d\n\nTransposing the text to a device doesn\u2019t help, indicating the problem runs deeper than preferences for screens over print.\n\nTaylor explains that attention isn\u2019t just a value in itself, but functions as the gateway to higher forms of learning \u2013 especially memory \u2013 which in turn leads to deeper comprehension. \u201cWithout the ability to pay attention to something, kids are not going to be able to process [information]. They\u2019re not going to be able to consolidate it into memory, which means they\u2019re not going to be able to interpret, analyse, synthesise, critique and come to some decision about the information,\u201d he says.\n\nThe classroom of the future\n\nWhen students can\u2019t seem to pay attention to long lectures, many teachers simply hack lessons into smaller chunks. Gail Desler, the tech integration specialist for Elk Grove school district, where Swift\u2019s school is located, says: \u201cA common thread among teachers is that short is good.\u201d\n\nDesler also points to teachers who begin classes with mindfulness exercises or deploy meditation when students need to concentrate. One high school teacher in Salinas, California, uses the Calm app to help students meditate, but a 2013 study indicated any sort of \u201ctech breaks\u201d could counteract anxious urges to multitask.\n\nSome teachers also choose to \u201cmeet kids where they are\u201d on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. Asha Choksi, vice-president of global research and insights at educational publisher Pearson, gives the example of a teacher who films himself performing a science experiment, posts it to YouTube and then uses the video in class to illustrate material in the textbook, which can seem boring to students. Similarly, Schad keeps students on task through Instagram, reminding them about homework and upcoming field trips.\n\nThese platforms especially extend attention when they reflect students\u2019 interests. Desler praises teachers who do things like tie the history of Nazi propaganda to cyberbullying. \u201cIt\u2019s about infusing relevant information into mandated curriculum in ways the students see themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you connect it to things happening here and now, then it enters their world and engages them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, specialised learning platforms like Flipgrid, which allows students to share videos of themselves giving presentations, help teachers engage students in their native media. A 2018 study from Pearson found that Gen Z students eschewed physical books, preferring video as a source of information second only to teachers. By meeting kids where they already engage and create, teachers can better capture attention.\n\nSome school districts have standardised digital migration to platforms like Google Classroom, which allows students and parents to monitor grades and upcoming assignments, tracking performance to better understand where students are falling behind.\n\nTechnology can even help mend the damage it does to reading skills. Schad says at her school in Philadelphia, teachers use computers to target struggling students. The school\u2019s preferred reading platform, Lexia, uses gamification to motivate participation. The programme also automatically splits up students based on performance, moving successful students to more advanced tasks offline while keeping struggling students engaged with digital exercises until they fully internalise the lesson. This targeted approach helps bridge the gap between students impacted to varying degrees by technology.\n\nThe US is a global leader in education technology, with edtech companies raising $1.45bn (\u00a31.1bn) in 2018. But firms like Flipgrid and Lexia will increasingly face competition from abroad. The edtech industry in East Asia is booming, especially as US platforms like Knewton expand overseas, tapping into growing global interest in adapting classrooms to digital native students.\n\n\u2018Blended learning\u2019\n\nStill, while some educators are embracing technology in the classroom, multiple studies have shown more traditional classrooms can be more successful. A 2015 study by the London School of Economics showed GCSE test scores improved when schools in Birmingham, London, Leicester and Manchester banned phones from class. Neuroscience professor William Klemm, author of The Learning Skills Cycle, points to a 2014 study that found taking notes in longhand helped students retain information better than using a laptop.\n\nKlemm also points out the dangers of chopping up lessons into small chunks, suggesting switching between small lessons too quickly could rob students of valuable comprehension. He says students need time to engage with a topic once the teacher introduces it before moving on.\n\nEven many tech-forward educators find value in traditional methods and suggest a \u201cblended learning\u201d approach. \u201cI've seen a lot of discussion among academics in recent years about whether the lecture format is a relic and should go the way of the dinosaurs,\u201d says Katie Davis, associate professor in the University of Washington Information School. \u201cI guess it comes down to whether you believe there are valuable skills involved in following a complex argument that is presented linearly in real-time.\u201d\n\nWhile Davis admits new media could provide valuable skills, she still believes lectures have their place.\n\nEducators across the tech spectrum agree the teacher\u2019s authority remains sacrosanct. Elizabeth Hoover, chief technology officer of public schools in Alexandria City, Virginia, works to enhance education in her district through technology, but she says she would never replace direct instruction from teachers.\n\nThe face-to-face interaction with the teacher is still the most important component in the classroom \u2013 Elizabeth Hoover\n\n\u201cThe face-to-face interaction with the teacher is still the most important component in the classroom,\u201d she says, favouring technology only when it enhances a lesson in ways impossible offline.\n\nSchad also points out that many teachers rely on technology only because they don\u2019t have sufficient resources offline. Programmes like Lexia wouldn\u2019t be necessary if schools provided more funding for aides, who could free up teachers to concentrate on struggling students.\n\nPhiladelphia teacher Sophia Date, who teaches 12th grade social studies, also questions the impulse to fund tech over more teachers. \u201cThere is a huge push for technology in the classroom, but at times I think that it is done in the place of larger, more necessary reforms. Grant organisations are happy to give money for a set of tablets or laptops, but not willing to provide a salary for a teacher for a year,\u201d she says.\n\nDate clarifies that equitable access to technology remains crucial to help close the gap for low-income students, but it cannot replace systemic change.\n\nLearn to think\n\nWhile technology undermines some aspects of education, it has also empowered students in unforeseen ways. \u201cThere is this view that young people are a bit apathetic, a little bit lazy, distracted by technology,\u201d says Choksi of Pearson. \u201cWe actually really underestimate the role technology is playing in children\u2019s education right now and the power it gives them over the way they learn.\u201d\n\nWe actually really underestimate the role technology is playing in children\u2019s education right now and the power it gives them over the way they learn \u2013 Asha Choksi\n\nFor instance, students impatient for educators to address questions are increasingly willing to seek answers for themselves. \u201cThey might be in algebra and go to YouTube to figure out how to solve a problem before going to a teacher or consulting a textbook,\u201d Choksi says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you ultimately want with kids,\u201d Swift adds. \u201cYou want them asking new questions, seeking new answers.\u201d\n\nTaylor points out that as information becomes ubiquitous, success is no longer about knowing the most. Instead, it\u2019s the ability to think critically and creatively, ironically the very skills that digital media undermines by lowering attention spans.\n\n\u201cIf you think of the Zuckerbergs and the Gates and the Sandbergs and all these people who became successful in the tech world,\u201d he says, \u201cit wasn\u2019t because they could code; it was because they could think.\u201d\n\nDigital natives will continue to voraciously adopt new media. Teachers have no choice but to evolve, not only to ensure students can access and take advantage of new technologies, but to fundamentally educate students to succeed in a world constantly trying to distract them.\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Teachers could work for longer hours in the classroom and reduce their preparation and non-teaching time. Or there could be a reduction in lesson time.\n\nBut getting a balance from this would have a heavy price tag. In some countries it would mean cutting students' instruction time by almost 70 hours per year to save the extra cost of recruiting more teachers to reduce class sizes.\n\nBetter results?\n\nIs reduced class size worth these costs?\n\nThere is no clear link between education systems with smaller classes and better learning.\n\nResults from the latest Pisa tests show no association between average class size and science performance.\n\nIn fact, East Asian countries such as Singapore and China often top the rankings both in terms of performance and in having the biggest class sizes.\n\nThe science results, perhaps unexpectedly, show higher scores for students in larger classes and in schools with higher student-teacher ratios.\n\nPerhaps this is a question of degree - and there might need to be a significant reduction in class size to have a positive impact.\n\nBut it seems whenever high-performing education systems have to make a choice between smaller classes and investments in teachers, they go for the latter.\n\nOf course, there could be other political and economic decisions, such as more funding for schools, so that the number of teachers and their salaries could both be increased.\n\nBut given that budgets are often constrained, this study shows how spending choices can have unanticipated outcomes.\n\nReducing class size is a costly measure, so it's worth considering the benefits against other policy choices.\n\nIf this was a financial decision how would you get more bang for your buck?\n\nHow would it compare with spending more on increasing teachers' salaries, investing in teacher training or changing the curriculum?\n\nCould cutting class sizes, seen as such a popular policy, come at the expense of the quality of teaching?\n\nMore from Global education\n\nThe editor of Global education is Sean Coughlan (sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk)."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/in_pictures", "text": "The human cost of insulin in America\n\nDiabetics in the US are rationing insulin - and dying.

But as it blended in with the black night so well all I could see was these eyes staring out of the picture.\"\n\nThe black leopard Will captured is a male and based on its size, thought to be around two years old.\n\n\"We had always heard about black leopards living in this region, but the stories were absent of high quality footage that could confirm their existence,\" said Nicholas Pilfold PhD, lead researcher for a leopard conservation program in Laikipia County.\n\n\"Collectively these are the first confirmed images in nearly 100 years of a black leopard in Africa, and this region is the only known spot in all of Africa to have a black leopard.\"\n\nDr Pilfold and his team say that \"confirmed\" here means that the image is clear and detailed enough to see the leopard's characteristic pattern.\n\nKenya's Daily Nation newspaper photographed a similar animal in 2013, although Dr Pilfold claims that leopard was not wild and was brought to Kenya from America as a cub.\n\nImage copyright Burrard-Lucas Photography Image caption When Will first looked at his camera all he saw were these eyes staring back at him\n\nWill has left his cameras at the park in Kenya and is flying back in a few weeks to see what else they've picked up - but time to get more pictures is running out.\n\n\"At this age is when he'd usually get pushed out of his territory by a bigger, stronger male and go off to find his own territory - so it's a bit of a race against time to get more photos.\"\n\nWhat makes a black panther?\n\nIt's easy to think of black panthers as animals in their own right, but Will says that's not the case.\n\n\"The term that makes them black is called melanism and it's the same thing that makes a house cat black, or any other cat species.\n\n\"It's kind of like albino but the other way.\n\n\"A black panther is basically a melanistic big cat. Typically in Africa and Asia that would mean a melanistic leopard - a black leopard.\n\n\"In South America it would be a melanistic jaguar - a black jaguar.\n\n\"Black panther is a looser term.\"\n\nWill captured a spotted leopard on one of the camera traps, which could be the black leopard's dad.\n\nImage copyright Burrard-Lucas Photography Image caption Dad?\n\nYou don't need two black leopards to make one, but both parents need to carry the recessive gene for melanism.\n\nWill says it's hard to say how many leopards there are in East Africa, given how secretive they are\n\n\"And then add to that only a tiny, tiny fraction would be black?\n\n\"There might be a handful in east Africa that are black.\"\n\nImage copyright Burrard-Lucas Photography Image caption A truly rare sight\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat", "text": "Have Your Say"}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/turkce/media/video", "text": "\u0130zleyin\n\nObama: Cinselli\u011finden eminsen etraf\u0131nda dans eden sekiz kad\u0131na ihtiyac\u0131n yok\n\nABD'nin eski devlet ba\u015fkan\u0131 Barack Obama, California eyaletinde kendi vakf\u0131n\u0131n bir etkinli\u011finde yapt\u0131\u011f\u0131 konu\u015fmada 'erkek olman\u0131n g\u00f6steri\u015f yapmak anlam\u0131na' gelmedi\u011fine dair gen\u00e7lere y\u00f6nelik tavsiyelerde bulundu.

Maelezo ya dhamira\n\nMara kwa mara, utaombwa kuwasilisha taarifa zako za kibinafsi (kwa mfano, jina na anuani ya email, nk) ili kupata au kutumia huduma zilizopo kwenye mtandao wetu. Huduma hizo ni pamoja na vijarida, mashindano, \u201cBatilisha Email\u201d, mazungumzo ya moja kwa moja, ubao wa ujumbe na uanachama BBCi.\n\nKwa kuandika maelezo yako kwenye nafasi zilizopo, unairuhusu BBC na mashirika yake yanayotoa huduma kukupatia huduma ulizoziomba. Kila unapotoa maelezo yako ya kibinafsi, tutahifadhi taarifa hizo kwa kuzingatia sera hii. Huduma zetu zimekusudiwa kukupatia taarifa unazotaka kupata. BBC itashughulika kulingana na sheria za sasa hivi na itadhamiria kutekeleza taratibu nzuri kabisa za sasa hivi za Internet.\n\n2. Tarifa za wageni\n\nWakati wowote unapotembelea mtandao wa BBCi, kurasa unazoziona, pamoja na kitu kinachoitwa cookie, zinaingizwa kwenye kompyuta yako (angalia kipengee cha 3 kupata mengi juu ya hili). Karibu kurasa zote, kama siyo zote kabisa, zinafanya hivyo, kwa sababu cookies zinaiwezesha kampuni inayomiliki kurasa hizo kufanya vitu vingi vyenye manufaa, kama vile kujua kama kompyuta hiyo (na huenda mtumiaji wake) ametembelea ukurasa huo hapo awali. Hii inafanyika wakati mtumiaji huyo anarejea tena kwenye mtandao, kwa kuchunguza ili kuangalia na kuikuta cookie iliyoachwa hapo nyuma, wakati mtumiaji alipozuru mtandao mara ya mwisho.\n\nTaarifa yoyote ambayo imetolewa na cookies inaweza kutusaidia kukupa wewe huduma bora na kutusaidia kuchunguza wasifa wa wageni wetu. Kwa mfano: kama ulipotembelea kurasa zetu mara ya mwisho, tuseme uliingia kwenye kurasa za elimu, basi tunaweza kukuta taarifa hizi kwenye cookie yako na kielelezo cha taarifa za elimu utakapoingia mara ya pili\n\nRedSheriff, kampuni ya vipimo na utafiti, inakusanya data ambazo siyo za kibinafsi zinazowahusu wageni wanaozuru kurasa zetu kwa niaba yetu kwa kutumia cookies na alama ambayo imewekwa kwenye mtandao wetu. Cookies hizo na alama iliyopo kwenye mtandao vinatoa takwimu ambazo siyo za kibinafsi kuhusu ziara zilizofanywa kwenye kurasa zetu, muda uliotumika kuangalia ukurasa, njia zilizotumiwa na wageni hao kwenye mtandao, data zilizopo kwenye mipangilio ya skrini za wageni na taarifa nyingine za kawaida. BBC inatumia taarifa kama hizi, na zile zilizopatikana kwenye cookies nyingine zilizotumika kwenye mtandao huo kusaidia kuboresha huduma kwa watumiaji wake.\n\nKama unataka kuikataa cookie ya RedSheriff's, unaweza kutumia utaratibu uliowekwa hapo chini katika kipengee cha 7. Kuilemaza (kuiondoa) alama iliyowekwa kwenye mtandao, unapaswa kupeleka maombi yako moja kwa moja kwa privacy@redsheriff.com. Taarifa nyingine zaidi kuhusu taarifa za faragha za RedSheriff's yanaweza kupatikana katika http://www.redsheriff.com/6.0.0.htm.\n\n3. Cookie ni nini?\n\nUnapoingia kwenye mtandao kompyuta yako mara moja itapewa cookie. Cookies ni faili za maandishi zinazoitambulisha kompyuta yako kwa mtambo wetu wa mtandao unaohifahdi kumbukumbu zote (server). Cookies zenyewe hazimtambui mtumiaji, ila tu zinaitambua kompyuta iliyotumiwa. Makampuni mengi ya mtandao yanafanya hivyo wakati mtumiaji anapozuru kurasa zao ili kuweza kujua jinsi watu wanavyoingia na kutoka kwenye mtandao huo.\n\nCookies zeneywe zinachukua kumbukumbu za maeneo ya mtandao ambayo yametembelewa na kompyuta husika, na kwa muda gani. Watumiaji wanapata fursa ya kuzifanya kompyuta kuruhusu cookies zote, kuwafahamisha wakati ambapo cookie imetolewa, au kutopokea cookies wakati wowote ule. Hilila mwisho linamaanisha kwamba huduma fulani fulani za kibinafsi hazitaweza kutolewa kwa mtumiaji huyo.\n\nNB: Hata kama hujaiweka kompyuta yako katika hali ya kuzikataa cookies, bado unaweza kusomasoma kwenye mtandao wetu bila kuandika jina lako, hadi hapo utakapojisalisha kutumia huduma za BBCi.\n\n4. Matumizi na hifadhi ya taarifa zako za kibinafsi\n\nUnapotoa taarifa zozote za kibinafsi kwa BBCi (kwa mfano, kwa ajili ya mashindano, huduma za jamii za BBCi (BBCi Community) au uanachama wa BBCi kisheria tunawajibika kwako katika kuangalia jinsi tunavyotumia data hizo. Tunapaswa kukusanya taarifa hizo kwa haki, hii inamaanisha kwamba tunalazimika kukuelezea jinsi tutakavyotumia data hizo (angalia matangazo kwenye kurasa husika ambazo zinakufahamisha kwa nini tunaomba maelezo hayo) na kukuambia kama tunataka upeleke taarifa hizo kwa mtu mwingine yeyote yule. Kwa kawaida, taarifa zozote zile unazozitoa kwa BBC zitatumika ndani ya BBC na watu wake wanaotoa huduma. Kamwe hazitapelekwa kwa mtu eyote yule nje yya shirika la BBC bila kupata idhini yako kwanza, isipokuwa tunapowajibika au tunaporuhusiwa kisheria kufichua taarifa hizo. Vile vile, kama unatuma au kupeleka maelezo yenye matusi au yasiyofaa juu ya BBCi au kwa BBCi na kama BBC itaona kwamba mwenendo huo ni mbaya na/au umerudiwa, BBC inaweza kutumia taarifa zozote zile zilizopatikana kuhusiana na wewe ili kukomesha mwenendo huo. Hii ni pamoja na kuwafahamisha watu wengine kama vile mwajiri wako, shule yako au kampuni inayotoa huduma za barua-pepe kuhusu yaliyomo kwenye maandishi yako au juu ya mwenendo wako.\n\nTutahifadhi taarifa zako za kibinafsi katika mitambo yetu katika muda wote ule ambao unatumia huduma yetu uliyoiomba, na tunaweza kuziondoa wakati lengo litakapotekelezwa, ama kwa upande wa uanachama wa BBCi utakapoamua kwamba hutaki tena kuendeleza usajili wako kama mwanachama wa BBCi. Hata hivyo kwa sababu za kiusalama, BBC inaweza kuhifadhi data za maandishi ya ujumbe (ikiwa ni pamoja na yaliyomo kwenye ujumbe, majina na wanachama, muda na tarehe) zilizotokana na matumizi ya huduma za jamii za BBCi (BBCi Community) kama vile Connector kwa muda wa miezi sita. Mahali ambako taarifa za kibinafsi zimehifadhiwa kwa ajili ya watu ambao bado hawajasajiliwa, lakini wameshiriki katika huduma nyingine za BBCi (kwa mfano vile mashindano), taarifa hizo zitahifahdiwa kwa kipindi kitakachoonekana kwamba kinafaa ili kuhakikisha kwamba huduma hizo zinaendeshwa vizuri. Tutahakikisha kwamba taarifa za kibinafsi zilizotolewa zinahifadhiwa vizuri katika hali ya usalama, kulingana na Sheria ya Kulinda Data ya mwaka 1998 (Data Protection Act 1998).\n\nKama umearifiwa kwenye mtandao wa BBCi kwamba taarifa zako zinaweza kutumiwa kuiwezesha BBC kuwasiliana na wewe kwa ajili ya \u201chuduma za kiutawala\u201d, hii inamaanisha kwamba BBC inaweza kuwasiliana na wewe kwa sababu kadhaa zinazohusiana na huduma uliyojiandikisha nayo. Kwa mfano, tunaweza kukupatia huduma ya kukukumbusha juu ya password yako au kukujulisha kwamba huduma husika imesimamishwa kwa matengenezo. Hatutawasiliana na wewe kwa ajili ya kutoa matangazo, kama vile kukujulisha juu ya kuboresha huduma zetu au juu ya vipindi vipya vya BBCi, isipokuwa kama unakubali bayana kwamba tuwasiliane nawe kwa malengo kama hayo wakati unapowasilisha taarifa zako kwenye mtandao, au baadaye kama utajiandikisha kwa madhumuni mahsusi ya kupokea taarifa kama hizo za matangazo.\n\n5. Kupata taarifa zako za kibinafsi - Access to your personal information\n\nUna haki ya kuomba nakala ya taarifa zako za kibinafsi zinazokuhusu ambazo BBC inazihifadhi na kusahihisha maelezo yoyote yenye makosa. (Tunatoza \u00a310 (paundi 10) kwa maombi ya taarifa hizo.) Tafadhali peleka maombi yote kwa Data Protection Officer, BBC Regulatory Legal Department, Room 3637, White City, London W12 7TS (Email: dpa.officer@bbc.co.uk).\n\n6. Watumiaji wenye umri wa miaka 16 au pungufu\n\nKama una umri wa miaka 16 au miaka pungufu ya hapo, tafadhali pata idhini kutoka kwa mzazi/mlezi wako wakati wote unapotaka kutoa maelezo yako ya kwenye mtandao wa BBC. Watumiaji ambao hawana idhini ya aina hiyo hawaruhusiwi kutupatia taarifa zao za kibinafsi.\n\n7.

Time Magazine senior editor Ryan Teague Beckwith has described trying to keep up with the twists in the Mueller investigation as akin to understanding the plot of a Russian novel by listening to a book club conversation.\n\nNow, at last, perhaps we will see the full manuscript. Or at least the CliffsNotes (that's York Notes to you Brits).\n\nOr maybe we won't.\n\nIf it all seems confusing, that's because no-one knows exactly what happens next - just that something may be about to happen soon.\n\nHow soon is 'soon'?\n\nAccording to multiple news reports, Mr Mueller's investigation could be completed within days. Several times we've been told it could come as soon as \"tomorrow\".\n\nIs that soon enough for you?\n\nJust because the Mueller investigation is drawing to a close, however, doesn't mean we'll know all the details immediately - or ever.\n\nThe notoriously tight-lipped former FBI director could simply announce that his work is done, pack his bags and go back to a private life of golf clubs, corporate boards, academic speaking engagements and trips to the Apple store Genius Bar.\n\nWait, won't there be a final 'Mueller Report' with all the juicy details?\n\nNot necessarily. In fact, probably not.\n\nIt doesn't seem likely there will be a detailed investigative narrative presented to the public similar to the multi-tome report produced by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr back in 1998.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Boxes and boxes of the Starr report\n\nMr Starr's wide-ranging investigation that started with a real-estate inquiry and ended up scouring Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was governed by a federal statute with different rules. And Mr Starr himself - a former judge and Republican administration lawyer - was a different kind of man to the by-the-books ex-Marine Mueller.\n\nMr Mueller's probe is conducted under the auspices of the Justice Department and is governed by its regulations.\n\nThe special counsel's obligations at the conclusion of his work are to provide a \"confidential report\" to Attorney General Bill Barr explaining his prosecutorial decisions.\n\nMr Barr must then provide the top members of the Senate and House Judiciary committees with a brief explanation of any actions taken - or instances where he overruled the special counsel's proposed action.\n\nIt is up to the attorney general to decide whether it would be in the \"public interest\" to make any of these reports or communications accessible to the rest of us.\n\nTraditionally the Justice Department has been reluctant to provide information about investigations that do not lead to criminal prosecution. That was a guideline notably violated by former FBI Director James Comey during his July 2016 press statement outlining the results of a federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Barack Obama's secretary of state.\n\nIt would be ironic, to say the least, if the resulting political fallout from Mr Comey's decision - which Ms Clinton's campaign believes dealt a mortal wound - is cited by Justice Department officials to defend a decision to keep confidential damaging details of the Mueller investigation involving Donald Trump.\n\nWhat will Bill Barr do?\n\nThis is the million-dollar question.\n\nIn his testimony during his January Senate confirmation hearings, Mr Barr was repeatedly pressed by Democrats to promise he would make public any findings or reports produced by the Mueller investigation.\n\nHe demurred.\n\n\"My objective and goal is to get as much as I can of the information to Congress and the public,\" he told Senator Dianne Feinstein. \"I am going to try to get the information out there consistent with these regulations and to the extent I have discretion, I will exercise that discretion to do that.\"\n\nHis answers left considerable wiggle room. He could view the Justice Department's special counsel regulations as a ceiling or a floor - a minimum requirement of disclosure that can be exceeded or a limit to what he can reveal, given confidentiality requirements and prosecutorial guidelines.\n\nSo we may not know anything?\n\nIt's certainly a possibility. Or if we do learn something, it could take a while to render it into a form for public consumption (or, given the way things work in Washington, to leak).\n\nImagine the scene in Washington, as the political world learns Mr Mueller has provided his findings to Mr Barr and then waits - for hours, days, maybe even weeks - to learn what, if anything, will come of it.\n\nThere is another possibility, however.\n\nUp until now, Mr Mueller has spoken through his court filings, which are rich in detail and new revelations. While Mr Mueller's report to the attorney general will be confidential, it may not be his final word at the conclusion of his investigations.\n\nThere may be more indictments to come.\n\nOver the course of the last 21 months, Mr Mueller - in his prosecutorial documents - has explained how Russian agents and operatives allegedly gathered information about the US political process, initiated a social media campaign to influence and enflame American political views, funded on-the-ground political activities, and hacked the emails and files of top Democratic operatives in an effort to damage Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nHe has prosecuted multiple members of the president's inner campaign circle for a variety of misdeeds, including obstruction of justice and lying about Russian contacts.\n\nHe helped strike a deal with Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, which unearthed evidence of Trump business negotiations with Russian officials conducted in the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHe indicted a Trump confidant, Roger Stone, for lying about his contacts with Wikileaks, the organisation he says was the conduit through which Russia injected its purloined material into the American political bloodstream.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe special counsel could be building a prosecutorial path that leads to the White House, with the final stones about to be set. Court-watchers note multiple sealed indictments have been filed in the federal courts used by Mr Mueller's team over the past few months. Those could be political and legal bombs, with their fuses lit.\n\nOr they could be duds.\n\nThat's it, then?\n\nHardly. Even if the Mueller investigation closes up shop and there is no \"report\", there are no new indictments and the attorney general's public pronouncements provide few details, it's not the end of the story.\n\nThere are a number of cases initiated by the special counsel - involving Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and deputy campaign aide Rick Gates - that still await final sentencing.\n\nFormer campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been jailed for fraud and awaits sentencing for crimes related to his lobbying.\n\nLong-time Trump adviser Mr Stone has yet to go to trial on his charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Mr Mueller has handed this prosecution over to government lawyers. There's also a special counsel case against Concord Management and Consulting, which Mr Mueller has charged with assisting Russia's 2016 social media election-meddling campaign.\n\nMeanwhile there's a plethora of other ongoing investigations that are being run independently of the special counsel's office. Federal investigators in New York are looking into possible election-law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses and misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee.\n\nThe US attorneys in Washington and Virginia also have their hands full, with the espionage case involving Russian Maria Butina and an unregistered foreign lobbying prosecution of Mr Flynn's business associates.\n\nThere are also state-level investigations of Mr Trump's charitable foundation and Trump Organization tax filings, as well as an ongoing lawsuit by Maryland and the District of Columbia alleging that the president, through his business dealings, is violating a constitutional rule prohibiting the acceptance of money from foreign governments while in office.\n\nMr Mueller may exit the stage, but the drama will continue."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47325381", "text": "Video\n\nThe rare phenomenon happens when light hits a waterfall tumbling down El Capitan.

It's possible such asteroids may have brought to Earth both the water and the organic material necessary for life to start.\n\n\"These samples will be crucial in investigating this possibility.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @haya2e_jaxa [TD1-L08E1] 2/22 at 8:42 JST.

A detailed analysis will now be done. \u2014 HAYABUSA2@JAXA (@haya2e_jaxa) February 22, 2019 Report\n\nHayabusa-2 had earlier dropped a small, reflective, beanbag-like \"target marker\" on to Ryugu. This was used as a guide as the spacecraft descended to the rough surface of the asteroid.\n\nControllers were aiming for the centre of a circle, some 6m in diameter, located about 4-5m away from the target marker.\n\nThe Japanese space agency (Jaxa) had originally planned to carry out the touchdown operation in October last year. But the asteroid's surface was found to be much more rugged than expected, with numerous, hefty boulders making it hard to find a location that was large and flat enough to sample.\n\nControllers had hoped they would have an area of about 100m in diameter to target. But because of the surface properties, this had to be reduced to a 6m circle for what team members are calling a \"pinpoint touchdown\".\n\nThe sampler horn that extends out from the bottom of the spacecraft has a length of 1m. It's therefore vital that there are no boulders more than 50cm in height at the landing site, to reduce the chances that the body of the spacecraft could hit a rock.\n\nImage copyright Jaxa Image caption The sampler horn will be used to collect material for delivery to Earth in 2020\n\nUnexpected surface properties also have the potential to affect the amount of material collected. Before arriving at Ryugu, researchers had expected the surface to be covered in a powdery layer of fine-grained material - the regolith.\n\nIn fact, the upper layer turned out to be akin to gravel, consisting of rocky chunks that are centimetre-sized or larger.\n\nProf Fitzsimmons told BBC News: \"This was a surprise, as other near-Earth asteroids we have visited previously have shown areas dominated by small particles.\n\n\"It might be due to the carbon-rich composition, as the previous NEAs are composed of silicate rock, which are more Earth-like. But the shape of Ryugu also implies it was spinning much faster in the past, so it's possible this could have affected the particles' sizes in some fashion.\"\n\nScientists carried out additional tests in Japan to determine whether the sample material could still be gathered by the spacecraft.\n\nThey used a container of artificial gravel with a similar size distribution to that on Ryugu. In a vacuum chamber, they fired a tantalum bullet identical to that used by Hayabusa-2 into the gravel.\n\nAccording to Jaxa, the results of the test exceeded expectations, with the tantalum projectile yielding fragments of rock in size ranges that should easily pass through the sampler horn.\n\nThis suggests that Hayabusa-2 should have been able to collect a sample.\n\nIn September, Hayabusa-2 deployed two robotic \"hoppers\" that propelled themselves across the surface of Ryugu, sending back images and other data.\n\nThen, in October, the \"mothership\" despatched a French-German instrument package called Mascot to the surface.\n\nLater this year, perhaps in March or April, Jaxa plans to detonate an explosive charge that will punch a crater into the surface of Ryugu.\n\nHayabusa-2 would then descend into the crater to collect fresh samples of material that have not been altered by aeons of exposure to space.\n\n\"We know that the surfaces of asteroids are changed over time by bombardment with energetic particles from the Sun and interstellar space,\" said Alan Fitzsimmons.\n\n\"Yet studies with telescopes show that this 'space weathering' affects the surfaces of carbon-rich asteroids differently to those mostly made from more rock-like silicate minerals. We don't know why this is, and the fresh sub-surface samples from Ruygu will play a very important role in understanding how this happens.\"\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-47319788", "text": "Image copyright Michael Tullberg Image caption Tork was diagnosed with a rare form of tongue cancer in 2009\n\nPeter Tork, a member of the made-for-TV pop group The Monkees, has died at the age of 77.\n\n\"There are no words right now... heartbroken over the loss of my Monkee brother Peter Tork,\" bandmate Micky Dolenz tweeted.\n\nTork, who played keyboard and bass for the group, was diagnosed with a rare form of tongue cancer in 2009.\n\nThe Monkees were huge in the 1960s, with hits like I'm A Believer and Daydream Believer.\n\nA post on Tork's official Facebook page said \"the devastating news\" was being shared \"with beyond-heavy and broken hearts\".\n\nIt said: \"Our friend, mentor, teacher, and amazing soul, Peter Tork, has passed from this world.\"\n\nA message posted on the band's official Twitter page said that Tork had \"passed peacefully\" and invited fans to share their favourite memories by adding their comments.\n\nThe family later released a statement in which they said they were \"saddened\" by Tork's death, but \"grateful\" for the \"attentive energy and dedication of Peter's fans worldwide\".\n\n\"Peter's energy, intelligence, silliness and curiosity were traits that for decades brought laughter and enjoyment to millions, including those of us closest to him.\n\n\"We ask that our family have time and space to grieve in privacy,\" it added.\n\nTork's contemporary, Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, tweeted:\n\nSkip Twitter post by @BrianWilsonLive I\u2019m sad to hear about Peter Tork passing.

But when his friends nearly died he thought again, says the BBC's Sue Mitchell.\n\nAzis Hanna, his wife Maryam, and their five-year-old daughter, Chia, arrived in Dunkirk in October and made more than 20 attempts to reach the UK before finally succeeding last weekend, in the back of a lorry.\n\nFor a while he had considered making the trip in an inflatable rubber boat. The smugglers made it sound quite safe, promising that one of them would travel in the boat with the migrants for 14 miles.\n\n\"When you go to English water they then call the police, the police come to help take you to England. Every smuggler says like this,\" Azis says.\n\nAt this point the smugglers themselves would travel back to France in an accompanying boat, the story went.\n\nBut the experiences of two friends from the Dunkirk camp filled Azis with horror.\n\nIranian Christians Bahador and Shoku, together with their children Maryam and Brinyamin, were driven to a beach south of the ferry port one winter morning and climbed into a small boat with six others.\n\nAbout 15 minutes after setting off, it capsized - and there were no life jackets. Seven-year-old Maryam says she was one of the only ones who could swim.\n\n\"This water was so cold, so much cold. My feet were going cold, it made me want to die,\" she says. \"I saw my brother, but couldn't get him.\"\n\nFortunately Bahador was able to lift them on top of the upturned boat.\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to Dangerous Crossings on Radio 4 at 11:00 on Wednesday 20 February\n\nOr catch up later online\n\n\"The sea was going up and down so much,\" Maryam says. \"It was strong and dark. My mum was crying and praying and others were shouting for help. They said we were going to die.\"\n\nEventually they were rescued but both children had to be treated in hospital for hypothermia.\n\nImage caption Bahador and his children, Brinyamin and Maryam\n\nThe other story that put Azis off the boat crossing involved his friend Solomon, and Solomon's partner, Siree, both also Iranian Christians.\n\nThey had already been at sea for hours when their engine failed. As efforts were made to restart it, the boat began to fill with a mixture of salt water and fuel - which burned their skin.\n\n\"Our skin was burning, just so painful. We were just scared. Somebody was crying, someone was praying. The boat was drifting,\" Solomon says.\n\n\"We were asking God, 'Why, what is happening to us? Why?' Me too, I ask God, 'Why God you take me from Iran to this sea to die here? Nobody knows where I am.' Three hours after our engine went off we were still at sea.\"\n\nIt was dark when a small boat - British, Solomon thinks - picked them up and transferred them to a French vessel, and they were taken to a hospital in France.\n\nImage caption Bahador's son, Brinyamin, at the camp in Dunkirk\n\nAfter hearing these stories, Azis told smugglers in Dunkirk that he wanted to make the journey by lorry. His mother borrowed \u00a310,000, using her house as security, and paid the money to the smugglers' associates in Iraq. Then a long series of failed attempts began.\n\nSometimes they were found by sniffer dogs at the French ports. On other occasions, the lorries set off in the wrong direction, heading into France towards Spain or Romania. On one occasion they climbed into a refrigerated lorry, but Chia could not stand the cold and started feeling unwell.\n\nAzis says the French police took a relaxed attitude if they caught him, often wishing him better luck next time.\n\nHis successful crossing took place on Saturday. They were called by the smugglers during the day and travelled by bus from Dunkirk to a lorry park in Belgium. There they were put in the back of a Romanian lorry with another family and entered the UK via the Eurotunnel. They stayed hidden until Northampton, when they created a disturbance and the surprised driver let them out.\n\nTackling smugglers\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDCI Neil Cripps of the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit says investigators sometimes have to allow unsafe boats to set off in order to gather evidence against the smugglers.\n\n\"To get our best evidence and to do a long-term permanent disruption to this crime route, we have to balance and juggle an element of risk to people.\"\n\nAn Iraqi Kurd smuggler operating in northern France, using the name Johno, says he spent four years in jail for human trafficking - then returned to the illegal business after his release.\n\nThey hid in woods until one of Azis's cousins, who is already living in the UK, could pick them up. Hours later, Azis reported to a police station to start his claim for asylum.\n\nAzis says life in Iraq had become dangerous for him because of an earlier attempt to reach the UK as a teenager, 15 years ago. On that occasion his travelling companion had died, as he jumped from a slowly moving lorry. Years later the man's uncle contacted Azis out of the blue, blaming him for the tragedy, he says, and threatening to kill his daughter if he failed to pay \u00a350,000 in compensation.\n\nAzis did not think of staying in France, because he speaks English, has relatives in the UK, and because the UK government helps refugees, he says. \"They give houses and everything,\" he says. \"In France it isn't like that. They do help, but nothing like that.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I am overjoyed and thank God for this. England is like heaven to me. No-one can hurt us here and we can sleep properly for the first time in months. My daughter can start school and get an education. She will be very clever and maybe even a doctor.\"\n\nImage caption British volunteer Rob Lawrie with Azis's daughter, Chia, in Dunkirk\n\nDCI Neil Cripps of the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit says increased vigilance at ferry ports, and the increased risk of getting caught when travelling by lorry, is making sea crossings more attractive for migrants.\n\n\"I am predicting, probably in the spring when the weather becomes calmer, that dinghies will start to increase,\" he says.\n\nDespite his family's disastrous experience, Azis's friend, Bahador, is one of those thinking of attempting the boat crossing again.\n\n\"We want to get away from here,\" he says.\n\n\"And we cannot come back to Iran because I am a Christian and would definitely die.

But as it blended in with the black night so well all I could see was these eyes staring out of the picture.\"\n\nThe black leopard Will captured is a male and based on its size, thought to be around two years old.\n\n\"We had always heard about black leopards living in this region, but the stories were absent of high quality footage that could confirm their existence,\" said Nicholas Pilfold PhD, lead researcher for a leopard conservation program in Laikipia County.\n\n\"Collectively these are the first confirmed images in nearly 100 years of a black leopard in Africa, and this region is the only known spot in all of Africa to have a black leopard.\"\n\nDr Pilfold and his team say that \"confirmed\" here means that the image is clear and detailed enough to see the leopard's characteristic pattern.\n\nKenya's Daily Nation newspaper photographed a similar animal in 2013, although Dr Pilfold claims that leopard was not wild and was brought to Kenya from America as a cub.\n\nImage copyright Burrard-Lucas Photography Image caption When Will first looked at his camera all he saw were these eyes staring back at him\n\nWill has left his cameras at the park in Kenya and is flying back in a few weeks to see what else they've picked up - but time to get more pictures is running out.\n\n\"At this age is when he'd usually get pushed out of his territory by a bigger, stronger male and go off to find his own territory - so it's a bit of a race against time to get more photos.\"\n\nWhat makes a black panther?\n\nIt's easy to think of black panthers as animals in their own right, but Will says that's not the case.\n\n\"The term that makes them black is called melanism and it's the same thing that makes a house cat black, or any other cat species.\n\n\"It's kind of like albino but the other way.\n\n\"A black panther is basically a melanistic big cat. Typically in Africa and Asia that would mean a melanistic leopard - a black leopard.\n\n\"In South America it would be a melanistic jaguar - a black jaguar.\n\n\"Black panther is a looser term.\"\n\nWill captured a spotted leopard on one of the camera traps, which could be the black leopard's dad.\n\nImage copyright Burrard-Lucas Photography Image caption Dad?\n\nYou don't need two black leopards to make one, but both parents need to carry the recessive gene for melanism.\n\nWill says it's hard to say how many leopards there are in East Africa, given how secretive they are\n\n\"And then add to that only a tiny, tiny fraction would be black?\n\n\"There might be a handful in east Africa that are black.\"\n\nImage copyright Burrard-Lucas Photography Image caption A truly rare sight\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat", "text": "Have Your Say"}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/media/photogalleries", "text": "\u1ea2nh\n\nLo\u00e0i hoa hi\u1ebfm ch\u1ec9 n\u1edf 12 n\u0103m m\u1ed9t l\u1ea7n\n\nL\u00e0 m\u1ed9t trong nh\u1eefng lo\u00e0i hoa hi\u1ebfm nh\u1ea5t th\u1ebf gi\u1edbi, Neelakurinji c\u1ee9 12 n\u0103m m\u1edbi n\u1edf m\u1ed9t l\u1ea7n \u1edf bang Kerala, n\u01a1i hoa ph\u1ee7 kh\u1eafp c\u00e1c tri\u1ec1n \u0111\u1ed3i b\u1eb1ng s\u1eafc t\u00edm."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/media/audio", "text": "\u00c2m thanh\n\n'T\u00f4i b\u1ecb b\u1eaft khi \u0111ang u\u1ed1ng c\u00e0 ph\u00ea s\u00e1ng \u1edf S\u00e0i G\u00f2n'\n\nNh\u00e2n ch\u1ee9ng Ho\u00e0ng Cua n\u00f3i b\u1ecb c\u00f4ng an b\u1eaft \u0111\u01b0a t\u1edbi khu v\u1ef1c C\u00f4ng vi\u00ean Tao \u0110\u00e0n, n\u01a1i c\u00f3 kho\u1ea3ng h\u01a1n 100 ng\u01b0\u1eddi kh\u00e1c c\u0169ng b\u1ecb gom l\u1ea1i trong s\u00e1ng Ch\u1ee7 Nh\u1eadt, 17/06."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/media/video", "text": "Video\n\nC\u00e1c video quay l\u00e9n \u0111ang l\u00e0 v\u1ea5n n\u1ea1n nh\u1ee9c nh\u1ed1i v\u1edbi gi\u1edbi tr\u1ebb Nam H\u00e0n\n\nH\u01a1n 5.400 ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u00e3 b\u1ecb b\u1eaft v\u00ec c\u00e1c t\u1ed9i li\u00ean quan \u0111\u1ebfn m\u00e1y \u1ea3nh ng\u1ee5y trang trong n\u0103m 2017, nh\u01b0ng \u00edt h\u01a1n 2% b\u1ecb b\u1ecf t\u00f9."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/media/video", "text": "Video\n\nC\u00e1c video quay l\u00e9n \u0111ang l\u00e0 v\u1ea5n n\u1ea1n nh\u1ee9c nh\u1ed1i v\u1edbi gi\u1edbi tr\u1ebb Nam H\u00e0n\n\nH\u01a1n 5.400 ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u00e3 b\u1ecb b\u1eaft v\u00ec c\u00e1c t\u1ed9i li\u00ean quan \u0111\u1ebfn m\u00e1y \u1ea3nh ng\u1ee5y trang trong n\u0103m 2017, nh\u01b0ng \u00edt h\u01a1n 2% b\u1ecb b\u1ecf t\u00f9."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/institutional/2009/02/000000_links", "text": "BBCVietnamese.com bao g\u1ed3m c\u00e1c li\u00ean k\u1ebft t\u1edbi c\u1ea3 trang n\u1ed9i b\u1ed9 BBC v\u00e0 b\u00ean ngo\u00e0i.

I'm with you.\"\n\nComedian Steve Harvey says: \"This is about coming to the aid of another brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred and racism and bigotry.\"\n\n31 January: Refusing to hand over his phone\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nJussie Smollett refuses to hand over his phone to police investigating the attack.\n\nThey wanted it to confirm details - including the MAGA references made - as the actor says he was on the phone to his manager at the time.\n\nA day later, the police say: \"He's a victim. We don't treat him like a criminal.\"\n\nThey say they won't demand the phone.\n\n1 February: Jussie Smollett speaks for the first time\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption 1 February: People come out in support of Jussie Smollett\n\nThe actor says he's \"OK\" after the incident.\n\nIn a statement, he says: \"The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.\"\n\nChicago police also release pictures of two \"people of interest\" they want to speak to.\n\nChief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi says \"detectives are taking this development seriously\".\n\n2 February: 'I'm the gay Tupac'\n\nAt a concert that had been planned for a long time, Jussie Smollett makes some more comments on the incident.\n\n\"I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to,\" he says, reading from a piece of paper.\n\n\"Just because there has been a lot of stuff said about me that's absolutely not true.\"\n\nGlancing at the balcony, he adds: \"I'm sure my lawyer's sitting up there like 'No, Jussie, no'.\"\n\nHe says: \"Above all, I fought... back.\"\n\n\"I'm the gay Tupac,\" he finishes, without explaining what he means.\n\n11 February: Phone records submitted\n\nJussie Smollett gives police a PDF file of his phone records, after they had originally asked for his phone and he'd refused.\n\nBut the files are redacted - some bits have been covered up.\n\nThe police says there's no reason to suspect any wrongdoing from Jussie Smollett and are \"not even looking at charges regarding filing a false report\".\n\n14 February: 'Persons of interest' arrested by police\n\nThe two people of interest are arrested and interviewed by the police, but not charged and not treated as suspects.\n\nThey are Obabinjo (Ola) and Abimbola (Abel) Osundairo, brothers originally from Nigeria.\n\nThey had worked as Empire extras, sometimes going to the gym with the actor, their lawyer says.\n\nSome of the items seized from a police raid of their home include a blackface mask, an Empire script, phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach.\n\nOn the same day, an interview with Jussie Smollett is shown on Good Morning America.\n\nHe suggests the alleged attackers were white, saying: \"If I had said [the attackers] was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more.\"\n\nOn his refusal to hand over his phone, he says: \"I have private pictures and videos and numbers... my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.\"\n\nAnd speaking through tears, he says gay people should \"learn to fight\" these kinds of attacks.\n\nChicago police say they have \"no evidence to support\" reports that the attack was staged.\n\n17 February: 'Trajectory of the investigation' has shifted\n\nChicago police say there have been \"some developments in this investigation,\" a day after they release the Osundairo brothers without charge.\n\nThey say they want to speak to \"the individual who reported the incident\" - Jussie Smollett.\n\nThe actor's lawyers say in a statement: \"Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.\"\n\nThey add it's \"impossible to believe\" that the Osundairos \"could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity\".\n\n20 February: Jussie Smollett is charged by police\n\nChicago police say the actor is charged with \"disorderly conduct/filing a false police report\".\n\nEarlier in the day, a reporter in the US obtains footage appearing to show the brothers buying materials, including ski masks, that had allegedly been worn by the people who attacked the actor.\n\nMr Smollett's lawyers say they will \"conduct a thorough investigation and mount an aggressive defence\".\n\nThe rapper 50 Cent, who had previously come out in support of Jussie Smollett, posts a picture on Instagram referencing the actor's \"gay Tupac\" comment.\n\nIn the picture, he's put Jussie Smollett's face over Tupac's on the album cover for All Eyez On Me -

But what does this mean for their children, and the thousands of others - some just days old - caught in an international battle?\n\nFor many, it is clear.\n\n\"There is a moral responsibility for every country to take these children back,\" Usama Hasan, head of Islamic Studies at Quilliam International. \"It is a moral duty.\"\n\nHow many children are there?\n\nIt is not known exactly how many children there are. According to a 2018 report from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR), at least 3,704 foreign-born children were taken to IS territory by their parents or carers, including 460 from France, at least 350 from Russia and almost 400 from Morocco.\n\nSeveral hundred of these children are known to have returned to their home countries since. A number are likely to have died in IS territory.\n\nImage caption A map showing the verified origin countries of children who travelled to Iraq or Syria\n\nBut, as the stories of the UK's Shamima Begum and US woman Hoda Muthana show, many of the women and men who went out to Syria and Iraq have had children since they arrived.\n\nThe ICSR said in July it had verified the births of at 730 children from 19 countries. However, other unverified reports put that figure at closer to 5,000.\n\nWhere are the children of IS members now?\n\nIt is hard to say where exactly all the children are now. For a start, they are spread over at least two countries: Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe situation in the camps in northern Syria is particularly dire, Save the Children points out. For a start, because these children are held in isolation with other perceived former members of IS, they are often not able to get as much food and medical care as they need.\n\nBut more than that, reports from inside the camps paint a grim picture of intimidation and fear.\n\n\"We thought we could put them [the foreign women] together with the Syrians and the Iraqis, and that they would adapt,\" the director of a Kurdish camp in northern Syria told France24 in February.\n\n\"But they're ferocious, they burned some of the Syrians' tents, they would call them cockroaches, infidels. They consider themselves as the only true Muslims. So we had to separate them.\"\n\nThese \"ferocious\" women continue their reign of terror in the segregated area: the journalist is later shown the remains of a burnt-out tent.\n\n\"A child died,\" one foreign woman explained to the camera, picking up the burnt remains of the canvas.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nMeanwhile, foreign children as young as nine are finding themselves in front of the courts in neighbouring Iraq, while hundreds of others are known to be being held in prison with their mothers as they are tried for their roles in IS.\n\nIt all adds to a sense of urgency to calls to countries to repatriate the children as quickly as possible.\n\n\"All children with perceived and actual associations with Isis [IS] are victims of the conflict and must be treated as such,\" Kirsty McNeill of Save the Children UK argues.\n\nWhat are countries doing to get them back?\n\nVery few foreign children have been repatriated so far. But while there are obstacles to bringing children back, like identification, governments across the world have been accused of stalling in order to avoid having to make difficult decisions.\n\nMeanwhile, numerous families still living in their home countries around the world have offered to take children in.\n\nIn Russia, more than 100 children have already been brought home to family members, many at the request of parents locked in prisons. The last flight brought back 30 children, and Russia plans to bring back another 40 this month.\n\nTanya Lokshina, Human Rights Watch associate director for Europe and Central Asia, told Bloomberg at the start of February it is \"the most active programme to return detainees from Iraq and Syria\".\n\nBut in other countries, families face a battle to get their grandchildren, or nieces and nephews, home from Syria an Iraq.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The story of how one father rescued his daughters from IS\n\nIn Belgium, a woman called Fatiha told the Washington Post she was ready to take in her six young grandchildren.\n\nHowever they remain in a camp in northern Syria, at the centre of a court battle, as the Belgian government tries to block their mothers returning.\n\nLike a number of other countries, including Russia, Belgium has said it is happy to take young children back - but not necessarily their parents.\n\nUK Home Secretary Sajid Javid suggested Britain - which, according to ICSR, had only seen the return of four children by July 2018 - might follow a similar policy when he noted the revocation of Ms Begum's citizenship would not apply to her newborn son.\n\n\"Children should not suffer, so if a parent does lose their British citizenship it does not affect the rights of their child,\" he said.\n\nBut Save the Children warns that separating the children from their mothers can also be damaging.\n\n\"We believe the best interests of the child are paramount, and this means a child and mother should remain together whenever possible,\" Ms McNeill said.\n\nCountries are beginning to change their positions. France was just repatriating children on a case-by-case basis, but says it is now considering taking IS members back to be dealt with at home.\n\nAre there any dangers in returning children?\n\nPossibly, says Gina Vale, the co-author of the ICSR study.\n\n\"Minors, specifically boys, have undergone both psychological indoctrination and intensive military and combat training within IS territory from a very young age,\" she points out.\n\nHowever, any concerns would have to be dealt with on an individual level.

You can filter the list using the categories below. Those with ticks have confirmed they are running, while those with crosses have said they are not. 38 candidates in total Elizabeth Warren Wall St critic Elizabeth Warren has been a favourite of the progressive left since she emerged on the political scene to push for tougher regulation of the financial sector after the 2008 economic crash. During her time in the US Senate she became known for her hard-nosed interrogations of Wall Street executives and as an outspoken critic of income inequality. That loyal base may be enough to rise to the top of a fractured Democratic presidential field - but she will probably have to pry some supporters away from Bernie Sanders, who will be competing with her for progressive hearts and minds. Anthony's take: She\u2019s got financial chops and is building a formidable political operation, but professorial Massachusetts liberals are a tough sell to the rest of the country. Progressives will have to decide if they find her promise of economic reform more attractive than Bernie's revolutionary zeal. undefined\n\nJoe Biden Obama's VP Barack Obama picked Joe Biden to be his running-mate in 2008 because of his supposed folksy appeal to white working-class and middle-class voters - and that's exactly why he could be a formidable candidate in 2020. The former Delaware senator unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1998 and 2008 and declined to run in 2016 after the death of his son from brain cancer. His long voting record, which includes backing the Iraq War in 2002, would come under much scrutiny if he does enter the race. He has sharply criticised Donald Trump for \"trashing American values,\" but he's seen as a Democrat who could work with Republicans. Anthony's take:\n\nKamala Harris Rising star Kamala Harris is the kind of Democrat who could stick around and prevail in what is sure to be a gruelling nomination battle. She is from California, which is rich in both primary delegates and fundraising dollars. As a woman, and from an ethnic minority, she is well positioned to capitalise on her party's growing diversity. She has one of the most liberal voting records in the US Senate at a time when Democrats are leaning to the left, but she also has a background as a hard-nosed prosecutor. That background may end up a vulnerability as well, given that some progressives have criticised her for failing to support California criminal justice reform efforts and pointed to her prosecutorial record as being insufficiently sensitive to the rights of the accused. Anthony's take: She will be tested in the coming months, but looks and sounds like the kind of fresh-faced candidate that will appeal to a wide range of Democratic constituencies. If she can post decent showings in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, she'll be well-positioned to emerge from the pack when the primary voting moves south and west.\n\nBernie Sanders Mr Anti-Establishment The Vermont senator would be 79 on election day, but he's decided to make another run at the top prize. His long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 captured the hearts of American progressives, and he has been packing arenas with loyal supporters ever since. But former allies Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard are both also running this time round and could carve off some of his support. Anthony's take: Bernie Sanders is a victim of his own success. In 2016 he pulled the Democratic Party to the left, but it means he's not as unique a candidate in 2020. He has the advantages of name recognition, fund-raising and national campaign organisation, but his opponents won't avoid attacking him the way Hillary Clinton did three years ago. His day as a plucky underdog are over. undefined\n\nJulian Castro Ex-Obama ally It wasn't long ago that Julian Castro would have been considered a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. He was a well-regarded mayor of San Antonio, landed the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention and went on to a Cabinet position in the Obama administration. Now, however, he may not even end up the most popular Texan in the race, if Beto O'Rourke decides to run. And there are other politicians - ones currently holding elective office or with instant name recognition - who are generating more presidential buzz. Anthony's take: His resume is solid and his Hispanic heritage is helpful, but his charismatically challenged speaking style is never going to light up a crowd. He's the kind of politician who seems engineered in a laboratory for the vice-presidential spot.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand #MeToo ally Kirsten Gillibrand has long been positioning herself as one of the candidates most likely to capitalise on the #MeToo movement, and her pitch as someone who will \"fight as hard for other people's kids as she would for her own\" just might resonate. The New York senator's steady march to 2020 has already hit a few bumps, though. She angered some Democrats by quickly calling for Senator Al Franken's resignation after he faced sexual harassment allegations. And she alienated Clinton loyalists by criticising Bill Clinton's handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. These decisions could hurt her, even if she cites them as evidence that she matches her feminist rhetoric with action. Anthony's take:\n\nBeto O'Rourke Rock star Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke came up short in his 2018 bid to oust Texas Senator Ted Cruz but it's impressive he pushed him so close in a traditionally red state. And more importantly, he drew big crowds and raised money like a national powerhouse. He may not have Latin roots but Mr O'Rourke is fluent in Spanish and leans heavily on his \"Beto\" nickname - a common contraction of Roberto - which he picked up as a child in El Paso. His passionate delivery along with his good looks and background as a skateboarder and a punk rocker have endeared him to liberals across the country. Anthony's take:\n\nSherrod Brown Midwest populist The gravelly voiced senator from Ohio has been consistently re-elected in a populous Midwest state that has slipped away from Democrats in recent years. His pitch for the presidency would likely focus on winning back working-class voters in the Midwest and beyond with his own brand of economic populism. At a recent event, he bemoaned soaring corporate profits amid low-wage growth and attacked President Trump for using \"his phony populism to distract from the fact that he has used the White House to enrich billionaires like himself.\" Anthony's updated take: Sherrod Brown has a proven appeal to Midwestern voters, having won multiple Senate elections in trending-conservative Ohio. He would have been a popular choice for Democrats focused on winning back states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, whose loss cost Hillary Clinton the presidency. He opted to stay in the Senate rather than try for the White House, however, saying others would continue his fight for American workers. No doubt every candidate in the Democratic field will claim he\u2019s talking about them.\n\nAmy Klobuchar Folksy senator Amy Klobuchar may not be a household name, but the three-term Minnesota senator has shown the ability to win votes in the kind of Midwestern battleground state that Donald Trump appealed to in 2016. Another former prosecutor, Ms Klobuchar won praise for her cool competence in the heated confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. She has long prided herself in being able to \"disagree without being disagreeable\", giving her a reputation for being \"Minnesota nice\". But the initial buzz around her campaign has been dampened a bit by recent allegations that she has been abusive toward her staff. Anthony's take: She offers a steady, sensible political outlook that could attract the majority of Democratic voters who are more interested in electability than ideological purity. She will be in the thick of the fight for the support of moderate Democrats.\n\nCory Booker Gifted speaker Cory Booker is a prodigious fundraiser who knows how to work Wall Street donors. His background reflects the diversity of the modern Democratic Party and his time as mayor of blue-collar Newark gives him a grounding to the plight of the underprivileged. The New Jersey senator has an undisputed talent for public speaking, making him one of the more engaging candidates on the stump. Many on the left don't trust him, however. They view his big-money ties as a liability and haven't forgotten his 2012 defence of Republican Mitt Romney's venture-capital background during that year's presidential campaign. Anthony's take: Mr Booker will be pressed to convince Democrats he's the one to take them to the promised land. He has some of that Obama 2008 hope-and-change magic, but his silver tongue will get quite a workout.\n\nStacey Abrams Southern progressive She would have become the first black female governor in US history if she had prevailed in her Georgia race last year. She lost by fewer than 55,000 votes to Republican Brian Kemp, who at the time was Georgia's secretary of state, and initally refused to concede victory after allegations of voter suppression. The buzz her candidacy generated among grass-roots Democrats is still present and she was tapped to deliver the Democratic response to Donald Trump's 2019 State of the Union Address. Anthony's take: She'd be a good candidate for any office, but she may have her eyes on the Senate now, not the presidency. And if she mounts a winning race there, she could help the Democratic nominee be competitive in Georgia, as well. undefined\n\nBill De Blasio Progressive mayor Bill De Blasio became a progressive darling when he won the New York mayor\u2019s office in 2013 while decrying the city\u2019s income inequality. Since then, he\u2019s enacted universal pre-kindergarten and policing reform but struggled to deal with the city's housing crisis. Anthony's take: He appears eager to tout his accomplishments on a national stage but his appeal is limited.\n\nHoward Schultz Starbucks tycoon Howard Schultz is the recently retired head of coffeehouse giant Starbucks with a net worth of more than $2.5bn. He has talked up fiscal restraint and government reform in public appearances. He intially explored running as a Democrat, but now he seems more interested in an independent bid, saying the party had \"shifted so far to the left\". Anthony's take: A self-proclaimed \"centrist\" running on a deficit-reduction platform might end up syphoning as many Republican moderates away from Trump as liberals or independents away from the Democratic nominee. That hasn't stopped those on the left from vigorously objecting to his proposed candidacy, however.\n\nHillary Clinton You know who After 2016, Hillary Clinton needs no introduction. She won more votes than Donald Trump but lost the election in spectacular fashion. Since then, she's continued to attack Mr Trump and his administration, particularly over its policy of family separation on the US-Mexico border.\n\nAndrew Gillum Future star The former-mayor of Tallahassee came within a fraction of a percentage of winning the governorship of key presidential swing-state Florida \u2013 closer than any Democrat has in 20 years. After the loss, the young and charismatic candidate said he still planned to remain on the front line fighting for a clean environment and better wages for teachers. On 20 March, he shed light on what that meant \u2013 spearheading a multi-million dollar effort to boost Democratic voter registration in his home state ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Anthony's updated take:\n\nPete Buttigieg Impressive millennial Pete Buttigieg isn't the only millennial in the 2020 race but he is positioning himself as a voice for the young. The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a military veteran and the only openly gay presidential hopeful. He\u2019s proven he can win locally in a conservative state and mounted a surprisingly strong bid for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017. Anthony's take: The march of time ensures millennials will run things someday. A Buttigieg presidency is a long shot for 2020, but his candidacy is a sign of things to come.\n\nOprah Winfrey Yes, that Oprah Oprah is a household name in the US, having built up a huge following during her long-running talk show by tackling issues people could relate to. She has also produced and acted in movies, published her own magazine, and set up her own cable channel - all of which has helped her to become one of the world's richest people. The TV star turned a lot of heads when she made a very political speech at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards, touching on themes of race, gender, power and the #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment. Anthony's take:\n\nTulsi Gabbard Iraq veteran Tulsi Gabbard, born in American Samoa and of Polynesian descent, is a difficult candidate to characterise. Most of the Hawaii congresswoman's views fit firmly in the progressive camp and she was an early and outspoken supporter of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. The Iraq War veteran has drawn criticism, however, for meeting with Bashar al-Assad in January 2017 - after the Syrian president had been accused of repeatedly using poison gas on civilian populations. The daughter of a socially conservative politician and activist, Ms Gabbard may also draw the ire of Democratic voters for her past criticism of \"homosexual extremists\" and opposition to abortion rights and gay marriage.\n\nMitch Landrieu Ex-New Orleans mayor The former mayor of New Orleans is a member of a prominent Louisiana political family. He gained national recognition in 2017 after the leading the charge to take down Confederate war statues in his city. After leaving office, he wrote a book called \"In the Shadow of Statues\" in which he discussed the controversy and his \"personal journey on race\". Anthony's take:\n\nEric Holder Ambitious ex-AG Eric Holder was Barack Obama\u2019s first attorney general \u2013 and the first black attorney general in US history. He is viewed as a champion of criminal justice reform by those on the left, but he became the poster boy for Democratic obstruction and overreach for his conservative critics. A corporate lawyer and veteran of the Justice Department, he\u2019s never run for elected office. Anthony\u2019s updated take:\n\nAndrew Yang Tech entrepreneur Yang is a technology entrepreneur who should be well prepared seeing as he announced he was running for president back in November 2017. He graduated from Columbia Law School and spent more than a decade working on several start-up companies before being appointed Ambassador of Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 by the Obama administration. He\u2019s proposing that the US government pay a $1,000-a-month \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d to all Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 as a form of universal basic income to cushion against fewer jobs due to increased automation. Anthony's take:\n\nJohn Kerry Veteran diplomat John Kerry was the Democratic nominee in 2004 and lost a close race against George W Bush. After studying at Yale, he enlisted in the US Navy and served in the Vietnam War. He was honoured with a Silver Star, Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. He was a Massachusetts senator from 1985 until 2013, when Barack Obama appointed him secretary of state. Anthony's take:\n\nTim Ryan Midwest moderate Tim Ryan is a congressman from working-class eastern Ohio, where he touts trade and jobs as his big issues, but he\u2019s moved to the left on social issues lately. Anthony's take: He launched a challenge to Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016, which has made him some powerful enemies. Democratic voters who want a candidate with mid-western blue-collar appeal, however, might not care. A bigger threat for Ryan is from Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown. undefined undefined undefined undefined\n\nMarianne Williamson Spiritual counsellor Marianne Williamson is a best-selling author, charity organiser and spiritual adviser who counts Oprah Winfrey as her most famous follower. Her bid to become president isn't her first foray into politics - she tried and failed to win California\u2019s 33rd congressional district back in 2014. She spent nearly $2m and finished fourth. Anthony's take:\n\nDwayne Johnson The, er, Rock Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson announced his presidential campaign while hosting Saturday Night Live in 2017. He even brought on Tom Hanks to ask him to be his running mate. But all was not what it seemed and the former WWE star later admitted that he was \"only joking\". The actor did, however, say that \"Americans deserve strong capable leaders who care about this country and its people\".\n\nTim Kaine The stepdad Tim Kaine was nicknamed \u201cAmerica\u2019s stepdad\u201d after his relatively bland but good-natured campaign as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. The Virginia senator, who is fluent in Spanish, cruised to re-election this year. Anthony's take: A friendly but somewhat bland one-time loser to team Trump may not be what Democrats are looking for in 2020. undefined\n\nMark Cuban The Left's Trump A business tycoon, sports-team owner and reality television show host with a penchant for producing outrageous quotes. Born and raised in a working class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Mr Cuban became a millionaire at 32 and a billionaire at 41. His main focus these days is his sometimes controversial ownership of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. He also has numerous other business commitments and investments, and a high-profile role as one of the investors on the Shark Tank TV show, the US version of the UK's Dragons' Den.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper Low-key moderate He has an amusing last name, but John Hickenlooper's popularity as the outgoing governor of swing-state Colorado is no joke. One of his more notable accomplishments in Colorado was tightening gun laws after the Aurora movie theatre shooting in 2012. Anthony's take: He\u2019s a business-first moderate who styles his low-key response as the \u201cantidote to Trump\u201d. Although he's a pro-business moderate, he has a list of progressive state-level accomplishments on healthcare, gay rights and the environment that he can tout on the stump. undefined\n\nTerry McAuliffe Pal of the Clintons Terry McAuliffe started his career as a behind-the-scenes political money man but parlayed that into a successful term as governor of Virginia. He ran campaigns for both Clintons and became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee so he knows how the power structures of the party work. Anthony's take: Due to the Ralph Northam blackface scandal, having experience as governor of Virginia isn't quite as big of a selling point as it used to be. McAuliffe's close ties to the Clintons will ensure he can raise plenty of cash, but his ties to the somewhat tarnished Democratic dynasty could be more of a hindrance than a help.\n\nJay Inslee Climate campaigner As governor of Washington, Inslee has taken a lead role in \u201cthe resistance\u201d to the Trump administration on the state level, including pushing a lawsuit that blocked the president\u2019s first travel ban. A former member of Congress, he\u2019s made climate change and the environment a top issue. Anthony's take: There once was a time when an experienced governor with a proven record of executive leadership would have a leg up in a presidential nominating contest. Senators, bogged down by countless votes and the necessities of legislative compromise, were at a disadvantage. Jay Inslee is a steady campaigner with a robust resume, but he might find it difficult to connect with the Democratic Party's increasingly diverse base. undefined\n\nJeff Merkley Oregon senator Merkley was the only senator to support Bernie Sanders in 2016 and is toward the left end of the 2020 presidential field. In June he made headlines by travelling to the US-Mexico border to denounce Mr Trump\u2019s policy of separating the families of undocumented migrants detained at the border. Anthony's updated take: If Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders had pulled each other down in a battle to claim the progressive candidate mantle, perhaps Jeff Merkley could have snuck through unscathed as an appealing alternative. Perhaps fearing he would get lost in the shuffle, he took his name out of contention. undefined\n\nMark Warner Economic moderate A former Virginia governor and, like Tim Kaine, a senator. He made a fortune as a telecommunications executive and has gained a national spotlight recently as the ranking Democrat on the Senate committee investigating Russian election meddling. Anthony's take: They say every senator sees a future president when looking in the mirror each morning, and Warner is no different. He has an influential perch on the Intelligence Committee, however, and may have plenty to keep him busy when the Robert Mueller investigation (eventually) concludes. undefined undefined\n\nSteve Bullock Little-known governor Steve Bullock is making a pitch as a moderate who can appeal to rural voters. The governor of Montana has been talking up campaign finance reform and net neutrality \u2013 two issues that have a passionate following on the left. Anthony's take: He has an uphill fight as a little-known governor from a distant state. undefined\n\nMichael Bennet Soft-spoken moderate A moderate senator from the trending-Democratic state of Colorado, Michael Bennet has been putting out presidential feelers. Anthony's take: At some point it will be easier to list the Democratic senators who aren\u2019t considering a 2020 run, rather than those who are. undefined undefined\n\nJohn Delaney Ex-tech entrepreneur John Delaney was officially the first entrant into the 2020 Democratic presidential field when the Maryland congressman announced his candidacy in July 2017. The former tech entrepreneur has a platform that focuses on jobs, education and infrastructure and a return to bipartisan co-operation. Anthony's take: Mr Delaney's call for a return to bipartisan co-operation is going to be a tough sell in today's sharply divided political environment. The three-term Maryland congressman has logged the hours in Iowa, which hosts the first nominating contest. He's got a chance if accumulated face time translates into votes. (It doesn't.) undefined\n\nEric Swalwell California congressman Eric Swalwell has been an outspoken critic of the president\u2019s and a fixture on cable news shows. He's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and was previously on the Homeland Security Committee, so has travelled to countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan. The California congressman has two children and brought his baby along to Congress for the swearing-in ceremony in January. Anthony's take: He could position himself among the \u201cyouth\u201d candidates in a field that will probably be dominated by greying front-runners. And Donald Trump's rise is evidence of the fact that a robust television presence can translate into voter support.\n\nJason Kander Army veteran The US Army veteran and former Missouri secretary of state generated presidential buzz after a surprisingly strong but ultimately unsuccessful 2016 Senate race in his conservative home state. He entered the race for Kansas City mayor in 2018, only to drop out because of PTSD issues arising from his Afghanistan War service. Anthony's take: Jason Kander was the 2016 version of Beto O'Rourke - a charismatic young Senate hopeful who came up just short in an effort to unseat a red-state Republican incumbent. Without a government office, even the most talented young politicians have a short shelf life, however. Recapturing that 2016 magic would be a tall order. undefined undefined\n\nSeth Moulton Ex-Marine Seth Moulton recently made headlines for mounting a futile effort to derail Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Massachusetts congressman served four tours in Iraq with the Marines before getting a master's degree in business at Harvard. Anthony's take: He may have presidential aspirations, but if you come at the queen you had best succeed. The next two years might be better spent mending fences in Congress, instead of making friends in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Their fear can come out as anger.\"\n\nImage caption A group of protesters came to voice their opposition to the story-telling event\n\nRylee says she is keen to show the children at the event that diversity exists in Greenville.\n\n\"I knew from a young age I was different. If I had this when I was younger, maybe I would have had a happier high school experience rather than being confused and sad and having anxiety,\" Rylee reflects.\n\n\"I felt like a bad person. You're in the South - [people think] if you're gay or different you're going to hell.\"\n\nThis sentiment is shared by Princess Mocha, another drag queen reading at the event.\n\nShe strides up and down in front of the children in a fuchsia jumpsuit and towering high heels, canvassing opinion on whether giraffes or elephants are the group's preferred animal.\n\nThe children's eyes follow her back and forth as she reads.\n\n\"You'll move mountains, kid\", Princess Mocha reads from her chosen book, before pausing and turning to the crowd. \"You really will,\" she adds.\n\nImage caption Police shut roads and restricted access to the library during the event\n\nOn the day of the event, the roads around the library are closed, and security is tight after threats of violence were made against those attending the story hour.\n\nAmanda Osborne, one of the event organisers, told the BBC that \"veiled or direct threats to attendees and the drag queens has been the scariest part\".\n\n\"There has been an armed guard posted in our local library every day for the last week. That's where we are in our community right now.\"\n\nThe opposition to the story hour was spearheaded by the Facebook groups \"GOP Politics of South Carolina\" and \"Greenville Tea Party\" who organised a \"pro-family community gathering\" to coincide with the event.\n\n\"I just disagree with targeting children,\" says protester Jan standing outside the library. \"They are actively promoting sin and wrongdoing and they are doing this to children.\n\n\"What they do in their own home or at some nightclub amongst consenting adults - have at it. But don't involve children.\"\n\nImage caption Protesters at the Drag Queen Story Hour event accused the organisers of \"indoctrinating\" children\n\nThe library, being a public institution, is bound by the First Amendment of the US Constitution which enshrines the right to free speech in law.\n\nIn a statement, library officials told local media that \"meeting spaces are available on an equitable basis, regardless of the beliefs or affiliations of the individuals or groups requesting their use\".\n\nJan says that she thinks \"that's a cop-out\".\n\n\"There should be a set of community standards for decency,\" Jan says. \"If a group doesn't follow that, then they cannot hold their meetings in the library.\"\n\nJan links the event to a wider trend she perceives in the US.\n\n\"I don't see why their rights should trump ours. It always seems in society today that's what happens. They want to be considered the victim, they want to have special rights.\"\n\nImage caption Many counter-protesters came to support the event\n\nIn response to the controversy surrounding the event, many counter-protesters assembled at the library.\n\nNatalie Shaik, one of the event organisers, told the BBC it was a \"big deal\" that so many people in Greenville came to support them.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of the controversy, the event is well attended and additional readings are laid on for the queue of children waiting.\n\nStory hour protests nothing new\n\nWayne Wiegand, professor of library sciences at Florida State University\n\nThe tradition of story hours in America began in the late 1800s in Hartford, Connecticut. Caroline Hewins created a read-aloud programme and by the end of the 19th Century the events were commonplace across the country.\n\nPublic librarians have done a good job of convincing the public that they are neutral, but through history they have had an inconsistent response to First Amendment issues.\n\nIn the early 20th Century, socialists and communists were often allowed to meet in libraries, for example. By the time the Cold War started, that was no longer the case.\n\nDuring the Civil Rights movement there were open protests by black families against \"Little Black Sambo\" being read at story hours. The book was accused of being racist and many libraries took it off their shelves.\n\nThe passage of time has a tendency to change local moral horizons.\n\nAmanda Garrett has lived in the South her entire life.\n\n\"It bothers me so much when people try to claim that they know what southern morals are, or that they own the values of our community.\n\n\"That gets me at a very personal level.\"\n\nImage caption Amanda Garrett brought her seven-year-old son Alex to the event\n\nMs Garrett's son Alex spent the afternoon listening to the drag queens reading and making a crown with pipe cleaners.\n\n\"The drag queens are dressing up, having a great time and confident about who they are,\" Ms Garret says. \"That's something Alex can be too if he wants.\"\n\nChristia Spears Brown is a professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky who studies gender development in children.\n\nShe told the BBC that while these events can seem \"silly and frivolous\" they could lead to \"positive outcomes for young children if they feel able to express themselves\".\n\n\"Conversely we know that there are negative outcomes for children who feel pressure to conform,\" Prof Brown said. \"Those children are not as psychologically stable.\"\n\nImage caption Elizabeth and David Truby took their 20-month-old son William to the event to \"show up for people who are marginalised\"\n\nProf Brown told the BBC: \"Culture can support, or not, a child's gender identity but it can't create it.\n\n\"To be clear, you can't make kids gay or transgender. Think of it this way - the vast majority of LGBTQ people saw predominantly cisgender and straight role models growing up.\n\n\"The frequency with which traditional gender stereotypes are reinforced - every time a child uses a gendered bathroom or is called a good boy or girl - far outnumber the instances that gender is questioned, for example being read to by a drag queen.\"\n\n."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47288219", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nJust a few weeks ago, \"Joyce\" received a phone call that threw her life in the air.\n\nJoyce is HIV positive, and was told in the call that this information - along with details of more than 14,000 other infected people in Singapore - had been made public in a massive data breach.\n\n\"I'm still very shocked and sad at how this happened,\" Joyce told the BBC.\n\n\"How is it that the place that I thought was safe is now not safe for us?\"\n\nThe scandal has gripped the Singaporean media for weeks.\n\nThe government has blamed the leak on the American partner of a local doctor, who had access to the records kept on all known HIV-positive people in Singapore.\n\nAuthorities say the leak has been contained, but this is little relief to a vulnerable community in a society that continues to stigmatise the condition.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The data leak raised questions about how safely Singapore stores data on its citizens\n\nJoyce, who didn't want her real name or nationality revealed, contracted HIV more than two decades ago from a boyfriend who went on to die from it.\n\nShe says she was unaware of her condition when she married her Singaporean husband and moved here with him. After a series of illnesses in the 1990s, her husband suggested they both take an HIV test.\n\nIt took a week to get the results.\n\n\"My English was very poor so they didn't call me but called my husband to tell him. He came home from work and said that he had good news and bad news.\"\n\nThe bad news was that she had tested positive. The good news, he said, was that even though he hadn't, he would support her emotionally and financially.\n\n\"I asked him, are you sure? This means we have no family, no children. But he said what was more important is that he needed a good wife who was kind and understanding. I thanked God for it.\"\n\nJoyce spent the next few years in and out of Singapore's Communicable Disease Centre, where she saw some of her fellow patients die. As a permanent resident, her medical care is subsidised but remains expensive. She knows some foreign spouses who had to leave because of the cost.\n\nAs required by law, Joyce's HIV status was added to a national database. The HIV registry was set up in 1985 by the Ministry of Health to keep track of the infection situation and trace potential cases.\n\nIt was this database - with the names and addresses of 14,200 people - that authorities say was leaked earlier this year.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Singapore says it will \"spare no effort\" to bring Farrera-Brochez to justice\n\nThe government has pinned the blame on Mikhy Farrera-Brochez, a US citizen who moved to Singapore in 2008. They say he obtained the data from his partner, Singaporean doctor Ler Teck Siang, whose job granted him rare access to the confidential registry.\n\nFarrera-Brochez is himself HIV-positive, which means he could not legally work in Singapore. But in 2017 he was convicted of fraud for using a sample of Ler's blood to pass a mandatory HIV test. After serving a jail term he was deported to the US. Ler is appealing against a two-year sentence for his role in the fraud.\n\nFarrera-Brochez - who this week appeared in court in Kentucky charged with trespassing at his mother's house - has fiercely denied being responsible.\n\nHe recently shared a string of angry posts on Facebook alleging that, among other things, another person was behind the leak, that he was abused while in police custody, that he had only contracted HIV while in prison and that he was denied medication. He accused Singapore - where sex between men is illegal - of using the HIV database to keep track of gay men.\n\nFacebook has since deleted Farrera-Brochez's account for violating its community standards, and Singaporean authorities have said his allegations are \"blatantly false\".\n\nHealth Minister Gan Kim Yong said Singapore was working with the US on the case and police would \"spare no effort pursuing all avenues to bring Farrera-Brochez to justice\".\n\n'No laws to protect us'\n\nA total ban on HIV-infected people entering Singapore was only lifted in 2015. Foreigners with HIV are not allowed to work in Singapore - unless like Joyce, they have permanent residency or are married to a Singaporean. Critics say this counts as discrimination, at a time when the virus can be controlled with medication.\n\nAvin Tan was one of the first Singaporeans to publicly come out about his HIV status. Now an activist with Action for Aids, he says living with the social stigma is challenging.\n\nImage caption HIV/Aids activist Avin Tan says HIV patients have little protection against discrimination\n\n\"There are a lot of laws that dictate what we need to do. We need to come out to our sex partners, our insurers, our employers and our health-care givers but there are no laws to protect us once we come out.\"\n\nSince the news of the leak, Action for Aids has been inundated with calls.\n\n\"A lot of people have been calling us crying, so worried that their children might find out, that their spouse would react.\n\n\"People are worried about employers finding out, insurers and their friends finding out. What's going to happen? Are they going to be blackmailed? Are they going to be threatened? I think there was a lot of fear.\"\n\nAvin, like Joyce, only learned of the leak when the health ministry alerted him. But what has angered many was that the ministry had known that Farrera-Brochez had the information since 2016.\n\nThe health ministry rejected allegations of a cover up.\n\nIt said it had \"judged that on balance, an announcement then would not serve the interests of the affected individuals, when weighed against the inevitable anxiety and distress they would experience\".\n\nImage caption Dr Leo Yee Sin says the community must be challenged over HIV stigmas\n\nFor a country that prides itself on its efficiency, the leak has been deeply embarrassing.\n\nIt comes not long after a series of lapses including a major health data breach last year which saw the personal medical information of 1.5 million patients, including the prime minister, leaked. The scandal has brought up many questions about how the city uses and safeguards such records.\n\nAt Singapore's brand new state-of-the art centre for handling communicable disease outbreaks, there is disquiet.\n\nDr Leo Yee Sin, who runs it, has worked with HIV positive patients since the outbreak first reached Singapore's shores in the 1980s. She says safeguards have been put in place which restrict doctors from accessing such confidential data. But she, too, admits that the real problem is how people living with HIV are treated by society.\n\n\"HIV-positive persons still face a lot of stigma. They find it very difficult to be accepted by society, so it's important for us to pick this up and challenge the community, because the stigma comes from the community.\"\n\nBut this might come too late for HIV sufferers like Joyce, who now lives in fear of her husband losing his job because of her condition.\n\nAsked if she believes them when they assure her the leak has been contained, she says it's 50/50.\n\n\"I got calls from others in my support group who said their families don't know, my kids don't know, my colleagues don't know, so now this information could still be out there to ruin our lives.\n\n\"This is confidential information and they were supposed to protect us.

But after 45 minutes, the odds of survival drop to about 20%.\n\nImage copyright Robodrone Image caption The Czech Mountain Rescue Service transports the Robodrone to the avalanche site\n\nSuffocation is the main cause of death.\n\n\"Once you're trapped, you can't move, even if you're only under 10cm (4in) of snow, and carbon dioxide quickly builds up around your mouth,\" says avalanche expert Henry Schniewind.\n\nFor someone in this situation, the best hope of rescue is currently an avalanche transceiver. Worn under your jacket, these hand-sized radio devices emit a low-power pulsed signal when activated.\n\nThey can also be switched to receive mode, allowing those skiing with avalanche victims to pinpoint the area where the signal is strongest, then use probes and shovels to dig them out.\n\nThe Czech Mountain Rescue Service (MRS) uses Robodrone Kingfisher drones fitted with cameras and its own avalanche transceiver detection system to locate buried skiers.\n\nImage copyright Robodrone Image caption The drone, equipped with cameras and a transceiver sensor, can \"talk\" to the rescue team\n\n\"We use drones fitted with a special system that works on the 457kHz frequency to detect avalanche transceivers,\" says MRS drone operator Marek Frys.\n\nBut finding someone's exact location on difficult terrain often takes too long. New triple-antenna transceivers can help boost the signal, but what do you do about people who aren't wearing any kind of transceiver?\n\n\"We are working on thermal and multispectral systems that can see gases such as methane and carbon dioxide and could also detect people buried in mud slides, or under rubble,\" explains Jean-Yves Barman, chief executive of software developer SCS Smart City Swiss.\n\nBut finding people is one thing, digging them out is another. And no drones can yet do the digging.\n\nImage copyright Robodrone Image caption Dogs are still useful for digging out avalanche victims\n\nThis is where dogs, fellow skiers and rescue teams are needed.\n\n\"The goal is to find them and dig them out as fast as you can,\" Mr Schniewind says.\n\n\"That's why most people who survive are saved by their companions rather than by organised rescue missions.\"\n\nOther technologies come in.\n\nSome skiwear is now fitted with so-called Recco reflectors that bounce back a directional signal to mountain rescue teams equipped with a Recco detector.\n\nRoland Georges, president of the high mountain guides office in the French resort of Courchevel, says: \"All the guides in Courchevel have Recco reflectors in their ski gear. However, it takes time to raise an alert and get a helicopter out.\"\n\nMr Georges believes drones could also become indispensible for mountain guides heading off the beaten track.\n\n\"Having seen how small and quick to activate drones can be, I would not be surprised if all guides are soon carrying one,\" he says.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nMany off-piste skiers also wear backpacks that incorporate avalanche airbags, designed to inflate when the wearer pulls a cord, and keep them on the surface of the snow.\n\nThe latest innovations in this field include German airbag manufacturer ABS's wireless partner activation system, that triggers all the bags in a group when one cord is pulled.\n\nABS chief executive Dr Stefan Mohr says the technology can \"remotely trigger partner airbags thanks to integrated wireless group activation, actively preventing the burial of more than one person\".\n\nAnd avalanche specialist Pieps has introduced an airbag that automatically deflates three minutes after being triggered so \"the pressure on the buried person is reduced and a big air pocket is created\".\n\nBut the essence of avalanche survival remains freeing those trapped as quickly as possible, Mr Schniewind says.\n\nImage copyright Pascal Sevoz Image caption \"Limiting avalanche danger is a big part of our work,\" says Pascal Sevoz, director of piste services at Meribel-Mottaret in France\n\nSetting off controlled avalanches to prevent deadly slides happening in the first place is one of the main responsibilities of patrol teams working in ski resorts.\n\n\"Limiting avalanche danger is a big part of our work,\" says Pascal Sevoz, director of piste services in the French resort of Meribel-Mottaret.\n\n\"The techniques we use to set off controlled slides include Gazex cannons - or metal pipes fixed to the side of the mountain on high-risk slopes - that explode a mixture of oxygen and propane, and Catex systems using cables along which explosive charges can be positioned.\"\n\nIt can be dangerous work.

This is the group of nine cardinal advisers who were appointed soon after Francis was elected.\n\nThe Pope is under serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to what is the most pressing crisis facing the modern Church.\n\nStories of abuse have emerged in every corner of the world. And the Church has been accused of covering up crimes committed by priests, leaving its moral authority in tatters.\n\nPope Francis must also confront the assumptions, attitudes and practices that have allowed a culture of abuse to flourish.

The journalists won a prestigious Pulitzer Prize and their work was dramatised in the film Spotlight.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The work of the Boston Globe's Michael Rezendes, (left), Walter V Robinson, and Sacha Pfeiffer (right) led to the Academy Award-winning film Spotlight\n\nThe scandals kept coming.\n\nConsider six of the eight Roman Catholic dioceses in the state of Pennsylvania, which were the subject of scrutiny last year.\n\nThe State Attorney, Josh Shapiro, subpoenaed and reviewed half a million internal diocesan documents. Dozens of witnesses gave evidence, some clergy admitted to their offences. Mr Shapiro's report, published in December, was devastating.\n\n\"Over 1,000 child victims were identifiable from the Church's own records,\" he wrote, with \"credible allegations against over 300 predator priests\".\n\nThe report, which is more than 1,000 pages long, covers the past 70 years - and the examples are horrific.\n\nIn the diocese of Scranton, a priest raped a girl and when she became pregnant arranged for an abortion. The priest's line manager, his area bishop, wrote a letter.\n\n\"This is a very difficult time in your life and I realise how upset you are,\" he wrote. \"I too share your grief.\"\n\nThe letter was not addressed to the girl, but the priest.\n\nIn another diocese, a priest visited a seven-year-old girl in hospital after she had undergone a tonsillectomy - and raped her.\n\nIn another, a priest abused a nine-year-old and then rinsed out the boy's mouth with holy water \"to purify him\".\n\nThe report concluded that predatory paedophiles had been able to abuse children because the Church hid their activities by moving accused clerics on to other parishes and not reporting their offences to the police.\n\nRape claims\n\nThe Rt Rev Franco Mulakkal had risen from small-town Kerala, on India's south-west coast, to become a bishop in the north of the country.\n\nHe was arrested in September 2018, following allegations from a nun that he regularly visited her convent in order to rape her.

The organisations involved included residential care centres for young people, schools, sports, arts and other community groups, and the Church.\n\nThe commission concluded that 7% of Australia's Roman Catholic priests had allegedly abused children between 1950 and 2010.\n\nIn one religious order, the St John of God Brothers, 40% of its leaders were accused of abusing children.\n\nChrissie Foster, the mother of two children who were abused by priests in Melbourne, complained to the authorities. She told BBC News that instead of addressing her concerns, the family became the subject of a whispering campaign.\n\n\"They said that we were liars, that we were after money,\" she said.\n\n\"That's what they would say to parishioners.

It was much easier to believe that lie than the truth that priests were sexually abusing children.\"\n\nIn August 2018, the Roman Catholic Church in Australia published its formal response to the Royal Commission.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Chrissie Foster is the mother of two children who were abused by priests in Melbourne, Australia\n\nArchbishop the Most Reverend Mark Coleridge, president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, said that \"far too many\" clergy, religious and lay people within the Church in Australia had \"failed in their duty to protect and honour the dignity of all including and especially the most vulnerable, our children and our young people\".\n\n\"With one voice, the bishops and the leaders of religious orders here this morning make the pledge, 'Never again,'\" he said.\n\n'Appalling abuse'\n\nLast summer, Britain's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse published a report on two of the most prestigious Roman Catholic schools in the UK: Ampleforth College, in North Yorkshire, and Downside School, in Somerset.\n\nAccording to the report, the schools \"prioritised the monks and their own reputations over the protection of children\" and \"appalling abuse was inflicted over decades on children as young as seven at Ampleforth and 11 at Downside\".\n\nThe inquiry heard witness testimony from those who were forced into sexual acts, sometimes in the presence of fellow pupils.\n\nIn conclusion, the report found that \"many perpetrators did not hide their sexual interests from the children\".\n\n\"The blatant openness of these activities demonstrates there was a culture of acceptance of abusive behaviour,\" it said.\n\nFollowing publication, Ampleforth said the \"abbey and college wishes to repeat their heartfelt apology to all victims and survivors of abuse\".\n\nDownside expressed similar regret, saying: \"The abbey and school fully acknowledges the serious failings and mistakes made in both protecting those within our care and responding to safeguarding concerns.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Downside Abbey and school apologised for failing its pupils\n\nFor an organisation that numbers more than 1.2 billion adherents and is present in virtually every country on Earth, the focus is now firmly fixed on Pope Francis.\n\nWhen he was elected, in March 2013, the Pope was fully aware of the impact of clerical abuse scandals on the Church.\n\nWithin a year, in July 2014, he met six victims from three countries - two people each from Ireland, Britain and Germany. At a private Mass, with the six victims among the congregation, he offered an explicit apology.\n\n\"Before God and his people, I express my sorrow for the sins and grave crimes of clerical sexual abuse committed against you,\" Pope Francis said during his homily, published later by the Vatican.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A demonstration near the Vatican in support of the victims of paedophile priests\n\n\"And I humbly ask forgiveness. I beg your forgiveness, too, for the sins of omission on the part of Church leaders who did not respond adequately to reports of abuse made by family members, as well as by abuse victims themselves.\"\n\nSoon after, Pope Francis added eight new members to the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, from Africa, Oceania, Asia, and South America. But this body was soon hit by defections. The only two individuals on the commission who'd been victims of abuse, Marie Collins and Peter Saunders, resigned.\n\nMarie Collins, who was molested by a priest when she was 13, wrote a letter saying that while the Pope may have wanted to address clerical abuse, the Vatican's bureaucracy kept obstructing proposals for change.\n\nAfter the commission made a recommendation that all correspondence from victims and survivors should receive a response, she discovered that none had received replies.\n\n\"I find it impossible to listen to public statements about the deep concern in the Church for the care of those whose lives have been blighted by abuse,\" she wrote, \"yet to watch privately as a congregation in the Vatican refuses to even acknowledge their letters.\"\n\nShe concluded with these words: \"It is a reflection of how this whole abuse crisis in the Church has been handled: with fine words in public and contrary actions behind closed doors.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Clerical abuse survivor Marie Collins resigned from the Church's commission for the protection of minors\n\nPope Francis has decided to open the doors, convening an unprecedented summit to address the issue. But he's already tried to reduce expectations by warning the media, during the flight back to Rome from the United Arab Emirates, that a three-day conference represents only the beginning of a conversation.\n\nOthers have argued that he should simply issue an edict for the Church to follow. But implementing universal protocols is challenging because the Church exists in a range of cultures and judicial systems.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a more pressing challenge for the 82-year-old pontiff. His pontificate began with widespread enthusiasm for a man who chose pastoral appeal over pomp and ceremony, humility and compassion over the trappings of status.\n\nBut how it ends is likely to depend on the action he takes, and the protocols he implements, to deal with the scourge of abuse.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues regarding sexual abuse raised in this article, help and support are available.

That could be about to change, as Victoria Gill discovered during a week-long trip to the exclusion zone.\n\n\"This place is more than half of my life,\" says Gennady Laptev. The broad-shouldered Ukrainian scientist is smiling wistfully as we stand on the now dry ground of what was Chernobyl nuclear power plant's cooling pond.\n\n\"I was only 25 when I started my work here as a liquidator. Now, I'm almost 60.\"\n\nThere were thousands of liquidators - workers who came here as part of the mammoth, dangerous clean-up operation following the 1986 explosion. The worst nuclear accident in history.\n\nGennady shows me a coffee table-sized platform, installed here to collect dust. This reservoir's bed dried out when the pumps taking water from the nearby river were finally switched off in 2014; 14 years after the remaining three reactors there were shut down.\n\nAnalysing dust for radioactive contamination is just a small part of the decades-long study of this vast, abandoned area. The accident turned this landscape into a giant, contaminated laboratory, where hundreds of scientists have worked to find out how an environment recovers from nuclear catastrophe.\n\nThe experiment that turned into a global catastrophe\n\nImage caption The damaged reactor is now entombed by a steel \"confinement structure\" as cranes dismantle radioactive remnants within\n\nOn 26 April, 1986, at 1:23AM, engineers cut power to some systems at Chernobyl nuclear power plant's number 4 reactor. It was a critical point in a test to understand what would happen during a blackout. What engineers did not know was that the reactor was already unstable.\n\nThe cut-off slowed turbines that drove cooling water to the reactor. As less water turned to more steam, the pressure inside built. By the time operators realised what was happening and tried to shut down the reactor, it was too late.\n\nA steam explosion blew the lid off the reactor, exposing the core to the atmosphere. Two people in the plant were killed and, as air fuelled a fire that burned for 10 days, a cloud of radioactive smoke and dust was carried on the wind around Europe.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chernobyl's post-human landscape\n\nBBC News Our World: In the Shadow of Chernobyl - Watch Victoria Gill's full report from the exclusion zone on Saturday and Sunday, 16 and 17 February, at 2130 GMT on the BBC News Channel, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.\n\nImage copyright G Laptev Image caption In 1986, Gennady Laptev (on the right) flew by helicopter daily to collect soil and water samples from around the damaged reactor\n\nThe first emergency workers rushed in as lethal smoke billowed out. Of 134 who were diagnosed with acute radiation sickness, 28 died within months. At least 19 have died since.\n\nGennady, an environmental scientist with the Ukrainian HydroMeteorological Institute, started work in the zone just three months after the evacuation. \"We used to fly in by helicopter every day from Kiev,\" he explains, \"to collect water and soil samples.\n\n\"The important thing then was to understand the extent of the contamination - to draw the first maps of the exclusion zone.\"\n\nToday, that zone spans Ukraine and Belarus. Covering more than 4,000 sq km - more than twice the size of London. Every community within a 30km radius of the plant was evacuated and abandoned; no-one was allowed to return here to live.\n\nIn a forgotten, outer portion of the exclusion zone, people were quietly allowed to return home a few months after the disaster.\n\nUnlike the \"30km zone\", no checkpoints prevent entry to this semi-abandoned area. Narodichi, a town of more than 2,500 people, is within that more-distant zone. Strict rules govern this officially contaminated district; exclusion zone land must not be cultivated to produce food and it cannot be developed.\n\nImage caption Narodichi is an officially contaminated town within the outer portion of the exclusion zone\n\nToday, though, this part of Ukraine is not easily delineated into two categories - contaminated or clean. Research has shown that Chernobyl's aftermath is more complicated, and the landscape here much stranger - and more interesting - than the stringent \"do not touch\" rules in Narodichi would imply.\n\nFear of radiation could actually be hurting the people of Narodichi far more than the radiation itself.\n\n'We're getting less radiation here than on the plane'\n\nOver Gennady's shoulder, I can see the nuclear power plant - less than a kilometre away from the reservoir bed we're standing on. Gleaming in the sunshine is the huge protective steel \"New Safe Confinement\" that now entombs unit 4. It was slid over the top of the accident's epicentre in 2016. Beneath it, robotic cranes are dismantling 33-year-old, radioactive wreckage.\n\nProf Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth, a colleague of Gennady's, is a scientist who has studied the aftermath of the disaster since 1990. Here on one of his numerous research trips to the zone, he shows me a dosimeter - a black plastic phone-sized gadget he carries throughout the visit.\n\nIt measures the external dose of radiation he is getting from the environment. Atoms of the nuclear fuel dust that were scattered here by the 1986 explosion are spontaneously breaking down. They are giving out high-energy rays as they do so, and Jim's dosimeter is detecting the dose of those that we are receiving every hour.\n\nImage caption The dosimeter calculates the radiation dose we receive every hour\n\nThe readings are in units (called microsieverts) that only make sense to me in the context of other relatively \"radioactive activities\". At one point in the middle of the flight to Kiev - for example - his dosimeter read 1.8 microsieverts per hour.\n\n\"It's currently 0.6,\" Jim says. \"So that's about [a third] of what we were getting on the flight.\" With the infamous power plant visible in the background, I'm incredulous. But, Jim explains, we live on a radioactive planet - natural radioactivity is all around us. \"It comes from the Sun's rays, from the food we eat, from the Earth,\" he says. That is why, up at 12,000m on an airliner, with less shielding from Earth's atmosphere, we receive a higher dose.\n\n\"Yes, the exclusion zone is contaminated,\" he tells me, \"but if we would put it on a map of radiation dose worldwide - only the small 'hotspots' would stand out.\n\n\"Natural radioactivity is all around us - it varies from country to country, from place to place. Most of the area of the exclusion zone gives rise to lower radiation dose rates than many areas of natural radioactivity worldwide.\"\n\n'You don't want to be in the hotspots for long'\n\nWhile the boundary of the exclusion zone has not changed, the landscape has - almost beyond recognition. Where people were forced out, nature has moved in. Wilderness combined with abandoned buildings, farms and villages gives a sense of the post-apocalyptic.\n\nJim and his colleagues spend their days here collecting samples and planting cameras and audio recorders, which silently gather information about what wildlife inhabits this post-human place, and how the radiation affects it.\n\nOn the second day of our trip to the zone, I follow the team into the Red Forest. This is an exclusion zone hotspot that, because of the direction of the winds in 1986, took the brunt of the shower of radioactive material.\n\nWe put on dust suits to avoid contaminating our clothing.\n\nIn the forest, Jim's dosimeter reads 35 - almost 60 times the external dose we were getting in the cooling pond.\n\n\"We don't want to be here for too long,\" says Jim. He and the team gather their soil samples swiftly, take some photographs and head back to the car.\n\n'The horses are adapting to the zone'\n\nImage caption Wild horses were released into the zone as part of an experiment to reduce the risk of wildfires\n\nIn the abandoned village of Burayakovka - just over 10km from the power plant - it is a very different approach. Jim and the team take their time exploring the area. The dosimeter reads 1.0 - still less than on the flight.\n\nInside one small, crumbling but still colourful wooden house, the sad truth of what people so suddenly lost here is apparent. A coat still slung over the arm of a chair is now covered in three decades of dust.\n\nBut what people left behind - through farming and gardening - has turned into a strangely rich habitat and provisions for wild animals. Long-term studies have shown that there is more wildlife in the abandoned villages than anywhere else in the zone. Brown bears, lynx and wild boar are seen roaming here.\n\nDr Maryna Shkvyria, a researcher based at Kiev Zoo, has spent years tracking and studying the larger mammals that moved in when people moved out.\n\nImage copyright TREE Research Project Image caption Camera trap images reveal that lynx now roam the exclusion zone\n\nThere are studies suggesting that birds in the most contaminated areas show signs of damage to their DNA, but Maryna's work is adding to a catalogue of research that suggests wildlife is thriving throughout much of the exclusion zone.\n\nChernobyl's wolves, she says, are a particularly striking example.\n\n\"After 15 years of studying them, we have a lot of information about their behaviour,\" Maryna explains. \"And the Chernobyl wolf is one of the most natural wolves in Ukraine.\"\n\nBy \"natural\", she means there is very little \"human food\" in the wolves' diet. \"Usually, wolves are around settlements,\" Maryna explains. \"They can eat livestock, crops and waste food - even pets.\" But not here where wolves hunt wild prey.\n\nChernobyl's wolves feed on deer and even catch fish. Some images - caught by camera traps - reveal gentler dietary habits. Wolves have been snapped eating fruit from around trees that used to be in people's orchards.\n\nThere is one group of animals that has made the zone its home and that - strictly speaking- should not really be here.\n\nImage copyright TREE Research Project Image caption Lack of hunting may have contributed to the success of Chernobyl's wolves\n\nIn 1998, Ukrainian zoologists released a herd of 30 endangered Przewalski's horses in the zone. The apparent aim was for the horses to graze overgrowth and reduce the risk of wildfire. There are now about 60 of them - in herds dispersed across Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nThey are native to the open plains of Mongolia, so forests peppered with abandoned buildings should not be ideal habitat. \"But they're really using the forests,\" explains Maryna. \"We even put camera traps in old barns and buildings and they're using them to [shelter] from mosquitoes and heat.\n\n\"They even lay down and sleep inside - they're adapting to the zone.\"\n\n'You can have the cherry vodka; I made it'\n\nWildlife might be making the most of what's gradually become a post-human nature reserve, but not every village was left for animals to claim. Some people still live here - deep in the 30km zone.\n\nImage caption Maria (right) and her neighbour are part of a community of just 15 self-settlers in the zone who grow their own food and make their own vodka\n\nOn my fourth day here, we visit Maria's house. She is outside in her garden when we arrive at the gate, and - as I try to introduce myself in a few stumbling words of Ukrainian - she interrupts me by wrapping me in a warm hug and kissing me on the cheek.\n\nToday is her 78th birthday. She is expecting us and has prepared a celebratory breakfast.\n\nMaria ushers me, Jim, his colleague Mike, and our interpreter Denis to a wooden table under a fruit tree.\n\nIt is a gloriously sunny day and pleasantly warm even at 9am. Maria starts to bring food - fatty salted bacon, a whole fish, sliced sausage and steaming hot, home-grown potatoes. There are two bottles of what appear to be spirits - one colourless, one dark red.\n\n\"If you don't like this vodka, you can have the cherry one - I made it,\" she says.\n\nMaria and her neighbours make up a tiny community of just 15. Each of these self-settlers, as they are known, travelled back across a patchily enforced exclusion zone boundary and reclaimed their homes in 1986.\n\nImage caption Signs bearing the names of abandoned communities make up a memorial in the town of Chernobyl\n\nAlmost every family forced to leave here was given an apartment in a nearby town or city. For Maria and her mother, though, this cottage, with the garden wrapped around it, was home. They refused to abandon it.\n\n\"We weren't allowed to come back, but I followed my mum,\" Maria recalls. \"She was 88 back then. She kept saying: 'I will go, I will go'. I just followed her.\"\n\nThere are about 200 self-settlers in total living in the zone and, for an ageing population cut off from the rest of the country, Maria says life is not easy.\n\n\"We're all very old,\" she tells me. \"And we take each day as it comes.\n\n\"I feel full of life when my children come to visit me from Kiev. Otherwise, it's not so interesting to live here. But you know this is our land - our motherland. It's irreplaceable.\"\n\nMaria's mobile phone rings and I am struck by the incongruity of our diminutive babushka hostess, standing in her exclusion zone garden, apparently trying to wrap up swiftly a call from her daughter. She is busy with her visitors from the BBC!\n\nRemote as it is, this is a close community. As we sit in the garden (knocking back cherry vodka at our Maria's repeated insistence) her neighbour arrives with a birthday gift. She sits on the bench near the garden gate; she can't walk too far.\n\nThe self-settlers are a tiny minority, though. Most people who so suddenly lost their homes here have no hope of coming back.\n\nImage caption Pripyat was home to 50,000 people before the accident\n\nMost of them lived in Pripyat - a true Soviet dream town, purpose-built for the power plant workers. Just a few kilometres from the plant itself, this town of 50,000 people was emptied overnight. No-one was allowed to return; it is now the archetype of a 20th Century ghost city.\n\nPripyat was, however, recently deemed safe to visit for short periods and has now become one of Ukraine's most talked about tourist attractions. An estimated 60,000 people visited the exclusion zone last year, keen to witness the dramatic decay.\n\nImage caption Signs of tourism are popping up around the exclusion zone\n\nIts bleak notoriety has made it the subject of some dark, social media-based showing-off. Search #chernobyl on Instagram and you will find - among the interesting landscapes and tourist snaps - images of anonymous, costumed characters, sometimes wearing gas masks or holding up creepy-looking dolls for the camera.\n\n'Tell people Chernobyl is not such a horrible place'\n\nThe town of Chernobyl itself - somewhat confusingly much further from the power plant than Pripyat - is in a less contaminated area. It has become a relatively populous hub. Power plant decommissioning staff, scientists and tourists stay here.\n\nGennady, Jim, me and the rest of the research team are staying in one of its small hotels - a Soviet-style building with an incongruously pretty, well-tended garden around it. This greenery is looked after by Irina, who manages the hotel. She stays here for three months at a time before a colleague takes over. People are only permitted to live in the town for limited periods.\n\nOver a cup of tea on our second evening at the hotel, Gennady translates as Irina tells us about her memories of the accident. She lived in Pripyat at the time with her grandmother.\n\nImage caption Pripyat's abandoned fairground has become an icon\n\nOn 27 April - a day after the explosion - the town was evacuated. People were ordered to leave immediately. They lined up for buses that would take them away from the town and the plant. Irina was on her way back to her grandmother's apartment at the time.\n\n\"A friend of my grandmother's was driving a cattle wagon - taking his livestock out,\" she recalled. \"My grandmother asked if he would take me with him, so I climbed on to the cattle wagon.\n\n\"I didn't know what was happening.\"\n\nImage caption Inside our Chernobyl hotel\n\nBut Irina, not unlike Maria, felt a need to return to the zone. She has never been back to Pripyat, though; it would upset her too much to see it now. But she takes pride in tending the flowers around her Chernobyl hotel.\n\n\"I like to make it as pretty as possible for the visitors,\" she tells me. \"So maybe you can tell people back home that Chernobyl is not such a horrible place.\"\n\n'We have forgotten that we are Chernobyl people'\n\nGennady's 33 years working in the exclusion zone might have been leading up to one meeting at the end of this week. It is being held in a school in Narodichi, the town in the outer zone.\n\nHere, scientists, community members, medical experts and officials from the state agency that manages the exclusion zone are gathering to discuss a change that could transform this district's future.\n\nFor the first time since the boundary was drawn, the zone is set to change. Three decades of research have concluded that much of it is safe - for food to be grown and for the land to be developed. Narodichi is one of its least contaminated places.\n\nJim and Gennady are presenting their conclusions at the meeting. Before it is under way, I have arranged to visit the town's kindergarten, where the children are playing outside in the sunshine.\n\nA rainbow-painted picket fence at the edge of their playground contrasts almost ludicrously with grey, half-built tower blocks next door.\n\nThere were 360 children here before the accident. Tatiana Kravchenko, a woman with a perpetual kind smile and who is wearing a thick, bright pink coat, is the kindergarten manager. She remembers the evacuation.\n\n\"The children were evacuated together with teachers to 'clean zones',\" she recalls. \"In three months we were sent back, and we had only 25 children. Eventually, people have come back, new children have been born and gradually the kindergarten started filling up again. Now we have 130 children here.\"\n\nMost of the time, Tatiana says, she does not think of her community as being within the exclusion zone. \"We forget that we are Chernobyl people; we have other issues to deal with,\" she tells me. \"It's no secret that half of the parents [of these kids] are unemployed, because there is nowhere to work. I wish that we could build something here - that our community could start to bloom.\"\n\n'Maybe it's time to redraw the map'\n\nBack in the meeting, Gennady peers over red-rimmed glasses, attentively listening to what is being said. Discussions are taking longer than expected. Much of the community input seems to reflect Tatiana's thoughts - that it is time for restrictions to be lifted here.\n\nBut there is a lot at stake.\n\nImage caption People still fear the legacy of what happened here in 1986\n\nPeople affected by the accident receive financial compensation from the government. Here, in a town of high unemployment, in a country where the average wage is less than 400USD per month, that income is important.\n\nAnd many still fear Chernobyl radiation - and the effect that it might still have on their health, and the health of their children. After many years of research, understanding and explaining the long-term health legacy of the accident has been infuriatingly complicated.\n\nIt is conclusive that around 5,000 cases of thyroid cancer - most of which were treated and cured - were caused by the contamination. Authorities failed to prevent contaminated milk from being sold in the region; many who were children at the time drank it receiving large doses of radioactive iodine. That was one of the contaminants blasted out of the reactor.\n\nMany suspect that the radiation has or will cause other cancers, but the evidence is patchy.\n\nProf Richard Wakeford, from the University of Manchester's Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, points out that health studies look for a \"signal\" of a specific health effect linked to Chernobyl.\n\nThey aim to pick out that signal above the \"background noise\" from other causes. That has been incredibly difficult, primarily because of the huge background noise that was the almost simultaneous upheaval of the Soviet Union's collapse.\n\n\"It's assumed that there will be some cancers linked to the accident in addition to the thyroid cancers, but detecting them amid that socioeconomic chaos - that had its own impacts on people's health - has proven almost impossible,\" says Prof Wakeford. Cancer also affects between a third and a half of people in Europe, so any Chernobyl signal is likely to be small.\n\nAmid reports of other health problems - including birth defects - it still is not clear if any can be attributed to radiation.\n\nImage caption Gennady (right) and his colleagues have grown crops in the exclusion zone as part of their research\n\nProf Geraldine Thomas from Imperial College London explains: \"Another confounding factor in this part of the world relates, confusingly, to iodine deficiency.\"\n\nIn its non-radioactive form, iodine is found in milk, green leafy vegetables and seaweed. A lack of it in the diet is a known cause of problems in the early development of the brain and spinal cord. \"So one possible cause of birth defects is actually a lack of iodine in the environment,\" the prof says.\n\nAll of this means that estimates of cancer cases remain highly contentious.\n\nIn its seminal 2006 report on the the long-term consequences of the accident, the World Health Organization did conclude that many people's mental health has been damaged - by fear of radiation and severe disruption to their lives.\n\nAs a scientist who has spent years scrutinising the truth about the contamination in the zone, Gennady admits that he did not expect the people of Narodichi to be afraid of radiation.\n\n\"It's a very big factor affecting their lives, even more than 30 years after the accident. This is really something that surprised me,\" he says.\n\nThat fear can be physically as well as mentally damaging.\n\nA sense of fatalism and hopelessness associated with assumptions of being doomed by radiation is thought to contribute to higher rates of of smoking and alcoholism in this region - both of which are definitively bad for people's health.\n\n\"It was a terrible thing that happened here,\" says Jim. \"But that tends to dominate people's lives.\n\n\"Somehow - and it's very, very difficult - we've got to move towards a situation where people can go back to living their lives without this fear, this radiation blight.\"\n\nWe're not going anywhere\n\nGennady emerges from the meeting looking a little jaded, but he says he is cautiously optimistic. The map was not officially redrawn today, but, crucially, most people in the room agreed there was a need for change.\n\nImage caption The Narodichi meeting could be a first step in transforming the district\n\n\"The community wants to bring more life here,\" Gennady says. \"And we, as scientists, know that a lot of places here can be easily excluded from this ban, so I think this was a very positive moment.\"\n\nAt the kindergarten, Tatiana has ushered the younger children inside for an afternoon nap.\n\nThere are rows of adorably tiny beds inside a new wing of the kindergarten that was built with money from a Japanese charity.\n\nThe close relationship between Japan and Ukraine has been forged by the former being in the early stages of understanding the impact of its own nuclear disaster - at the Fukushima power plant.\n\nLooking from the pristine new kindergarten building to the neighbouring derelict block, she says she would support the town's removal from the zone.\n\n\"These houses could be reconstructed and filled with people. We dream about that.\n\n\"We live here. We are not going to leave for anywhere else. Our children live here.\"\n\nBy BBC Science Correspondent Victoria Gill. Photographs by Jemma Cox.

That was one of the main things I wanted when I was younger.\"\n\nAfter a course at a performing arts school in Cornwall, Alex was awarded a place at the prestigious Northern Ballet School in 2015 - yet half way through the course, he decided to leave.\n\n\"The thought of getting a job at the end was probably one of my biggest fears,\" he says.\n\nThe life of a dancer can be an unstable one, going from one contract to the next, often with periods of joblessness.\n\nOne evening Alex was walking home from dance school in Manchester when it occurred to him how to achieve greater job security.\n\n\"I walked past an Army's career centre and I just looked into the window for two or three minutes and realised maybe that is the next step for me, the next window for me to go through to better myself as a person,\" he says.\n\nHe says that, despite appearances, dancers and soldiers have quite a lot in common. Self-discipline is important in both cases, and a determination to succeed.\n\n\"Dancers are very driven, motivated and they want to get the end product, they want to get that performance on stage that looks perfect. And then you've got soldiers who are dedicated, driven and they want to soldier to the highest of levels,\" he says.\n\nAnd both roles also require high levels of fitness - so Alex was well-prepared for the physical tests he and other applicants had to undergo.\n\n\"I had probably the quickest run time on the day for the mile and a half,\" says Alex. \"I think dance carried me through selection and then it carried me through basic training, because I was quite physically fit. I could carry the weight because I was used to lifting girls.\"\n\nAt first Alex only told his girlfriend, a dancer, that he was applying for the Army. It wasn't until he was awarded a place that he told his mum he was leaving dance school and coming home.\n\nImage copyright Alex Smith\n\n\"Obviously she wasn't thrilled,\" says Alex. \"Because all the hard work and everything that I'd put into the last 18 years of my life she said I'd thrown it away, but I don't believe in that statement because I think it's made me the person I am today and it's made me a better person.\"\n\nAlex says any parent who has a son or daughter in the armed services fears that they will one day be deployed to a war zone. But his mother has now accepted his new career, he says - and is delighted that he is now combining it with dance.\n\nWhen he joined the Army, he decided not to mention his dance training to the other soldiers, because he didn't want them to have any preconceived ideas about him.\n\nHe didn't mention his audition for the role in 5 Soldiers either. All the other dancers there were professionals, so he didn't expect to get the role - and was shocked when he got a call from the choreographer on his way back to camp, telling him that he had been successful.\n\nThe next morning he told his fellow soldiers all about it, revealing his hidden talent for the first time.\n\nImage copyright Rosie Kay Dance Company\n\n\"To be honest nothing really changed, because I'd already earned the respect of everyone, because I was fit and a good soldier and I kept my head down and I did what I had to do,\" he says.\n\n\"So when I said, 'Oh by the way I'm going to do dance,' most of them were quite jealous.\"\n\nThere has been no teasing, he says.\n\n\"I think the army's changed since a few years ago,\" he says. \"No-one will give you stick because you're all in it together, and obviously everyone has their own reasons for joining.\n\n\"Some join to forget their past lives or some join to better themselves, like me, and so it's not like school, it's a very grown-up environment where you do what you want to do, as long as you get the task done at the end of the day. It doesn't matter what you do in your spare time or what you've done in your past life.\"\n\nAt school it was very different, he says. There was \"the odd idiot who thinks he's funny\", as he puts it.\n\n\"I went to a Welsh medium school and the teachers weren't much help, they just thought, 'Oh yeah, they're only having banter.'\"\n\nAlex says this had an impact on his studies.\n\n\"I wasn't really interested in learning. I just didn't want to be there,\" he says. \"But since I'm older I don't care - people can say what they want. Everyone's got their own opinions, I don't have to care about it.\"\n\nImage copyright Rosie Kay Dance Company\n\nIn rehearsals for 5 Soldiers, Alex says he found himself using muscles that he hadn't used for a while.\n\n\"While I'm here I'm still going for runs and we do warm-ups in the morning where we're doing press-ups, sit-ups and that sort of thing,\" he says. \"I think I'll go back to the army a fitter soldier, to be honest.\"\n\nHe says he's enjoying being a dancer again, but that the most nervous night of his life will be when some of his squadron come to watch him perform.\n\n\"They're serving soldiers and I want them to feel as if it is real - as real as it is on camp,\" he says.\n\n\"I don't want them to come in and go, 'Err I'm watching a ballet.' Because it's not a ballet, it's a piece of dance that's re-enacting the life of a soldier in camp and on tour.\n\n\"The scene where we're patrolling around - in my head I'm feeling like, 'Yes I am on patrol and I'm working with fellow soldiers and not just working with four other dancers.'\"\n\nHe says the piece will also crush a few stereotypes.\n\nImage copyright Rosie Kay Dance Company\n\n\"It isn't just boys jumping around in tutus with pointe shoes on and makeup, it is men being men on stage.\"\n\nThe Army has been very supportive, he says, giving him time off to take part in the rehearsals and the production. He will return to his regiment in July after the tour is over.\n\n\"My ambitions at the minute are to go back and see how far I can take my soldiering career, see how far I can push myself, because I am a very ambitious person,\" he says.\n\n\"I do work hard for what I want and if I want something I will try my best to get it, and I think the Army's instilled that in me from training.\"\n\nHe is not sure yet, however, what the future might hold for him with dance, but is keen to find out if there are any other dancing soldiers out there.\n\n\"At the moment I'm just trying to enjoy 5 soldiers and take everything on board and just live this dream, all that I've worked for for the last 18 years,\" he says.\n\n\"I am just very appreciative that all the training that I have done, and all my teachers - which I am really thankful for - have been able to put me in this position.\"\n\nThe Rosie Kay Dance Company's production of 5 Soldiers will be touring the UK, Denmark and the US.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47119930", "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption El Chapo trial: Five facts about Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n\n\nThe trial and conviction of the notorious Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, also known as El Chapo, told us much about the man, the multi-billion drugs trade and the attempts to stop it.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n, the notorious Mexican drug-cartel leader, has a nervous tic.\n\nHe tugs at his right lapel. On difficult days in the courtroom, such as when his ex-mistress testified, he pulled at his jacket more than usual.\n\nHe stood trial in New York for drug trafficking charges after successfully evading US and Mexican authorities for years and escaping from prison in Mexico on two occasions.\n\nOther times during the trial, he glanced around the room in a furtive manner. He is known for tunnelling his way to freedom, and people in the room said jokingly that he was looking for an escape route.\n\nShortly before the jury began their deliberations, Guzm\u00e1n stopped searching for a way out. He listened intently to the judge. The man who had once overseen the Sinaloa cartel, an enterprise fuelled by cocaine, violence and terror, looked uneasy.\n\nNow he has been found guilty of all 10 criminal counts related to drug trafficking. He faces life in prison, and officials say that most likely he will be taken to a federal supermax in Colorado.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n was legendary for the tunnels he used to transport drugs under the US-Mexico border as well as to flee prison and escape from authorities. But no-one has ever escaped from the supermax, a place that a warden once described as \"a clean version of hell\". Chances are Guzm\u00e1n will die there.\n\nFrom a business perspective, he'd had a good run. He made $14bn (\u00a311bn) over the course of his career, according to prosecutors.\n\nHe trafficked in cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other drugs, explained a US assistant attorney, and he oversaw a network of dealers, kidnappers and \"henchmen\", a team of assassins on his payroll.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A wanted poster in Monterrey, Mexico features El Chapo at the top\n\nTwo years ago, Guzm\u00e1n was extradited to the US. His three-month trial in a New York courtroom featured more than 50 government witnesses, including men and women who had pursued him for years as well as former cartel associates who decided to testify against him in the hope that they would receive lighter sentences.\n\nThe government's first witness, Carlos Salazar, a retired customs agent, says he has seen up close the violence that Guzm\u00e1n and his cartel members inflict on people.\n\nSalazar had \"butterflies\" in his stomach when he walked into the courtroom and testified about a tunnel in Arizona that he had found, one that Guzm\u00e1n used for hauling bricks of cocaine underneath the US-Mexico border.\n\nStill, Salazar says: \"I did make it a point to look in his direction. I made eye contact.\"\n\nIndividuals such as Salazar and Brennan, who work or have worked in law enforcement but were not involved in the prosecution, still see the trial as vindication. \"It's rewarding to see that at the highest level of narcotics distribution, someone would be held accountable,\" says New York City's special narcotics prosecutor, Bridget Brennan. \"There's satisfaction in that.\"\n\n\"He wreaked havoc in the US for many, many years,\" says Michael McGowan, a former FBI undercover agent and the author of Ghost, a book that describes one of the bureau's investigations of Guzm\u00e1n. \"It's time to face the music.\"\n\nImage caption Prosecutor Bridget Brennan says Guzm\u00e1n's methods were \"wily\"\n\nWashington officials were paying attention: Matthew Whitaker, the acting US attorney general, was in the courtroom one day, shaking hands with prosecutors. The announcement of the verdict was a \"proud day\" for them, says Mark Feierstein, a former senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs on the national security council. But he warns: \"We're not going to win the drug war by prosecuting El Chapo.\"\n\nThe US spends more than $47bn (\u00a336bn) every year in the fight against illicit drugs, according to the Drug Policy Alliance, a non-profit organisation based in New York. Yet despite the efforts to arrest drug makers, dealers and kingpins, the problem remains daunting. In 2017, 72,000 people died from accidental drug overdoses in the US.\n\nSome analysts say that the jury's verdict in the trial will lead to more violence because traffickers will now fight over territory in a post-Chapo narco-land. \"This is a corporate struggle,\" says Dennis Jay Kenney, a former police sergeant who is now a professor at John Jay College in New York. While the cartel members jostle for power, he says: \"There'll be more bodies hanging from bridges in Mexico.\"\n\nThe trial could have been held in Chicago, Miami or any number of other US cities, since Guzm\u00e1n and members of his cartel had operated across the nation.\n\nBut officials in the US attorney general's office decided the New York prosecutors had the best chance of winning the case.\n\nHomeland security vans were parked outside the courthouse each morning during the trial. A Geiger counter was located in the lobby, sitting on a table next to a gas mask.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mexican police display drugs and weapons seized from the Sinaloa cartel\n\n\"Cagey, wily\", says narcotics prosecutor Bridget Brennan, describing Guzm\u00e1n: \"Really bold\".\n\nThe trial showed Guzm\u00e1n's human side. He and Mariel Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3, a member of his legal team and a recent law-school graduate, sat next to each other in the courtroom and passed notes back and forth. \"It's been a client-attorney relationship and very professional,\" she says. \"But there's always room for laughs.\"\n\nIn Mexico, ballads known as \"narcocorridos\" are devoted to him, and a 2014 poll suggested most people believed he was more powerful than the Mexican government.\n\nPeople in Culiac\u00e1n, a city in the Mexican municipality where Guzm\u00e1n grew up, adore him. \"A magnificent person,\" a bookseller told Reuters: \"It's such a pity he won't be able to escape from the United States.\"\n\nGuzm\u00e1n is famous in the US too. At a bagel shop a couple miles from the courthouse, the El Chapo is made with jalape\u00f1o cream cheese (cartel members used to pack cocaine into jalape\u00f1o cans). In a Netflix series Narcos: Mexico, he is portrayed as a cunning, violent man.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Supporters in his home state rallied for his release after his 2014 arrest\n\nWhen Guzm\u00e1n walked into the courtroom each morning, a hush would fall. When a defence lawyer hugged him, people gasped.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n's wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, 29, sat on the other side of the courtroom, wearing a watch with diamonds, the same kind of jewels that were once affixed, according to a government witness, to her husband's pistol.\n\nAs the prosecutors showed, Guzm\u00e1n used violence to maintain control over the illegal drug market and reaped its rewards, bestowing riches on his family.\n\n\"I saw him wave at his wife, and at first I thought: 'How cute,'\" says Malcolm Beith, who has written a book about Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nA moment later, his feelings changed: \"I almost threw up in my mouth. I had this visceral reaction, knowing what he's responsible for.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Emma Coronel Aispuro watched the courtroom proceedings from one of the benches\n\nFor some, that was the attraction.\n\n\"Isn't it worth it to see a person who's been called the most dangerous man in the world?\" says Clarissa McNair, a private detective who lives in Queens, while she ate a chocolate chip cookie during a courtroom break. \"He looks small and inconsequential,\" she says, adding: \"His looks are very deceptive.\"\n\nA cosmetics sales representative says she wanted to see the \"telenovela\", comparing Guzm\u00e1n's trial to a Spanish-language serialised drama. Others in the courtroom acted like they were at a matinee -one afternoon a couple sat in the second row, listening to the proceedings, and cuddled.\n\nIt was a grisly movie with a high body count.\n\nAssistant US Attorney Andrea Goldbarg told jurors about an evening in the mountains of Sinaloa when Guzm\u00e1n \"levelled his rifle\" at a wounded man and \"cursed him and then shot him\". She said: \"The cartel's engines were violence and corruption.\"\n\nTrolleys of documents, stuffed into accordion folders, were parked next to her table in the courtroom - the \"mountain of evidence\" that Goldbarg described in her closing argument. Towards the end of the trial, pillows were available for exhausted members of the legal team.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption An El Chapo plaque in a chapel in Culiacan, Sinaloa - his home state\n\nGoldbarg said that the evidence all pointed to one thing - Guzm\u00e1n called the shots.\n\n\"He's the one deciding who lives and who dies.\"\n\nDuring her closing argument, she replayed a video that showed Guzm\u00e1n interrogating a man who was hog-tied and bound to a pole - while a rooster crowed in the background. The video demonstrated, according to Goldbarg, that Guzm\u00e1n not only oversaw the cartel, he personally inflicted the violence.\n\nLater one of Guzm\u00e1n's lawyers paced around the courtroom and tried to portray Guzm\u00e1n as a victim of the US authorities, saying he was not the cartel leader and yet had been \"hunted like an animal\" for years - and that the government's witnesses were criminals and should not be trusted.\n\nA government lawyer said it would be great to \"call angels as witnesses\" but in Guzm\u00e1n's case it made sense to ask those who knew about the cartel to testify in court about his criminal activities.\n\nOne of the witnesses, Guzm\u00e1n's former mistress Lucero Guadalupe S\u00e1nchez L\u00f3pez, 29, said that he had told her that he would kill anyone who crossed him - even if they were a member of his own family. \"I didn't want for him to mistrust me because I thought he could also hurt me,\" she said.\n\nImage caption In the courtroom, Lucero Guadalupe S\u00e1nchez L\u00f3pez described her fear of Guzm\u00e1n\n\nWhile she was in the witness box, she blinked every few seconds. At one point she began to cry.\n\nThe fear that she felt in the courtroom was part of a strategy that Guzm\u00e1n and his cohorts used to maintain control.\n\n\"If you've lived with them, you know what they're capable of,\" says Robert Mazur, a former federal agent who worked undercover as a money launderer. (His memoir, The Infiltrator, was turned into a Bryan Cranston thriller.) \"They wouldn't think for half a second about killing everybody in your family.\"\n\nAnalysts say that the trial, however spectacular, will have little impact on the drug war. \"We're trying to stop commerce in a product that is in high demand,\" says the Cato Institute's Ted Galen Carpenter.\n\nYet US authorities say the trial nevertheless plays a key role in the fight.\n\n\"It's important to hold everyone, and especially those at the very top of the pyramid, accountable for their actions because there's been a tremendous amount of tragedy and death and misery,\" says narcotics prosecutor Bridget Brennan.\n\nFormer agent Michael McGowan agrees that it's important to hold Guzm\u00e1n accountable but he says he feels no personal animosity towards him.\n\n\"He's a professional. We're professionals,\" says McGowan. \"We happened to win the last round.\"\n\nIn the end, the trial helped to shed light on the drug trade and its impact on the nation.\n\n\"It's very simple,\" McGowan says, describing both the trial and his work as an agent. \"It's the search for the truth.\"\n\nGuzm\u00e1n already knows the truth about his role in the cartel, and towards the end of the day he regained his swagger.\n\nBefore the jury began deliberations, he turned to his lawyers and made a fist, a kingpin's salute, and left the room."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47311145", "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson: \"Smollett dragged city's reputation through mud\"\n\nUS actor Jussie Smollett staged a fake attack on himself because he was \"dissatisfied with his salary\", Chicago police say.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a news conference that he \"took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career\".\n\nMr Smollett, 36, is charged with filing a false police report after he said he was the victim of a homophobic attack.\n\nPolice say he also had sent a racist letter to himself at a Fox studio.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Smollett appeared in court and was ordered to submit a bond of $10,000 and surrender his passport.\n\nJudge John Fitzgerald Lyke called the charges \"utterly outrageous\" and \"despicable\" if true.\n\nThe star of the TV series Empire is suspected of paying two brothers to stage the attack.

Many trepanned skulls show signs of cranial injuries or neurological diseases, often in the same region of the skull where the trepanation hole was made.\n\nBut as well as being used to treat medical conditions, researchers have long suspected that ancient humans performed trepanation for a quite different reason: ritual.\n\nThe earliest clear evidence of trepanation dates to approximately 7,000 years ago. It was practised in places as diverse as Ancient Greece, North and South America, Africa, Polynesia and the Far East. People probably developed the practice independently in several locations.\n\nArchaeologists have turned up some of the best evidence for ritual trepanation ever discovered\n\nTrepanation had been abandoned by most cultures by the end of the Middle Ages, but the practice was still being carried out in a few isolated parts of Africa and Polynesia until the early 1900s.\n\nSince the very first scientific studies on trepanation were published in the 19th Century, scholars have continued to argue that ancient humans sometimes performed trepanation to allow the passage of spirits into or out of the body, or as part of an initiation rite.\n\nHowever, convincing evidence is hard to come by. It is almost impossible to completely rule out the possibility that a trepanation was carried out for medical reasons, because some brain conditions leave no trace on the skull.\n\nHowever, in a small corner of Russia archaeologists have turned up some of the best evidence for ritual trepanation ever discovered.\n\nThe story begins in 1997. Archaeologists were excavating a prehistoric burial site close to the city of Rostov-on-Don in the far south of Russia, near the northern reaches of the Black Sea.\n\nThe site contained the skeletal remains of 35 humans, distributed among 20 separate graves. Based on the style of the burials, the archaeologists knew that they dated to between approximately 5,000 and 3,000 BC, a period known as the Chalcolithic or \"Copper Age\".\n\nLess than 1% of all recorded trepanations are located above the obelion point\n\nOne of the graves contained the skeletons of five adults \u2013 two women and three men \u2013 together with an infant aged between one and two years, and a girl in her mid-teens.\n\nFinding multiple skeletons in the same prehistoric grave is not particularly unusual. But what had been done to their skulls was: the two women, two of the men and the teenage girl had all been trepanned.\n\nEach of their skulls contained a single hole, several centimetres wide and roughly ellipsoidal in shape, with signs of scraping around the edges. The skull of the third man contained a depression which also showed evidence of having been carved, but not an actual hole. Only the infant's skull was unblemished.\n\nThe job of analysing the contents of the grave fell to Elena Batieva, an anthropologist now at the Southern Federal University in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. She immediately recognised the holes as trepanations, and she soon realised that these trepanations were unusual.\n\nThey had all been made in almost exactly the same location: a point on the skull called the \"obelion\". The obelion is on the top of the skull and towards the rear, roughly where a high ponytail might be gathered.\n\nOpening the skull in this location would have risked major haemorrhage and death\n\nLess than 1% of all recorded trepanations are located above the obelion point. What's more, Batieva knew that such trepanations were even less common in ancient Russia. As far as she was aware at the time, there was just one other recorded case of an obelion trepanation: a skull unearthed in 1974 at an archaeological site remarkably close to the one she was excavating.\n\nClearly, finding even one obelion trepanation is remarkable. But Batieva was looking at five, all of them buried in the same grave. This was, and is, unprecedented.\n\nThere is a good reason why obelion trepanation is uncommon: it is very dangerous.\n\nThe obelion point is located directly above the superior sagittal sinus, where blood from the brain collects before flowing into the brain's main outgoing veins. Opening the skull in this location would have risked major haemorrhage and death.\n\nThis suggests the Copper Age inhabitants of Russia must have had good reason to perform such trepanation procedures. Yet none of the skulls showed any signs of having suffered any injury or illness, before or after the trepanation had been performed.\n\nAmong the 137 skulls, they found nine with conspicuous holes\n\nIn other words, it appeared as if all of these people were trepanned while they were completely healthy. Was their trepanation evidence of some sort of ritual?\n\nIt was an intriguing possibility. However, Batieva had to give up the trail. She had many more skeletons to analyse from all over southern Russia, and could not afford to get sidetracked by just a few skulls, however enigmatic.\n\nBefore she gave up, Batieva decided to search through Russia's unpublished archaeological records, in case any more strange obelion trepanations had been discovered but not reported.\n\nSurprisingly, she got two hits. The skulls of two young women with obelion trepanations had been discovered years earlier: one in 1980 and another in 1992. Each one had been unearthed less than 31 miles (50km) from Rostov-on-Don, and neither showed any signs of having been trepanned for a medical reason.\n\nThis gave Batieva a grand total of eight unusual skulls, all clustered in a small region of southern Russia and potentially all of about the same age. A decade later, even more came to light.\n\nIn 2011, an international team of archaeologists was analysing 137 human skeletons. They had recently been excavated from three separate Copper Age burial sites around 310 miles (500km) south-east of Rostov-on-Don, in the Stavropol Krai region of Russia, close to the modern-day border with Georgia.\n\nThe archaeologists had not set out to discover trepanations. They were there to learn about the general health of the prehistoric inhabitants of the region. But among the 137 skulls, they found nine with conspicuous holes.\n\nSouthern Russia may have been a centre for ritual trepanation\n\nFive of them were standard examples of trepanation. The holes had been made in a variety of different locations around the front and side of the skull, and all of the skulls showed signs of having suffered a physical trauma, suggesting that the trepanations had been performed to treat the effects of the injuries.\n\nBut none of the other four trepanned skulls showed any signs of damage or disease. What's more, all four had been trepanned exactly above the obelion point.\n\nQuite by chance one of the researchers \u2013 Julia Gresky, an anthropologist at the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) \u2013 had already read Batieva's paper describing the unusual trepanations from the Rostov-on-Don region.\n\nNow Gresky, Batieva and other archaeologists have teamed up to describe all 12 of the obelion trepanations from Southern Russia. Their study was published in April 2016 in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.\n\nThe 12 skulls would have been remarkable discoveries wherever they had been found. But the fact that they were all discovered in the same tiny corner of Russia meant that a connection seemed likely. If there was no link, the odds that a batch of such rare trepanations would turn up exclusively in southern Russia would have been exceedingly low.\n\nGresky, Bateiva and their colleagues argue that, while this idea is difficult to prove, the clustering of these unusual trepanations suggests that southern Russia may have been a centre for ritual trepanation.\n\nThe owners of the other skulls seem to have survived their operations\n\nMaria Mednikova of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow is an expert on Russian trepanation. She believes that trepanations in specific, dangerous areas of the cranium may have been performed to achieve \"transformations\" of some kind. She suggests that, by trepanning in these places, people thought they could acquire unique skills that ordinary members of society did not have.\n\nWe can only speculate as to why these 12 apparently healthy people were trepanned in such an unusual and dangerous way. But thanks to the trepanation holes themselves, we can infer a surprising amount about the fate of the people after they received their trepanation.\n\nOne of the 12 skulls belonged to a woman under the age of 25, who had been buried at one of the sites near Rostov-on-Don. It showed no signs of healing, suggesting that she died during her trepanation or shortly afterwards.\n\nHowever, the owners of the other skulls seem to have survived their operations. Their skulls showed bone healing around the edges of the trepanation holes \u2013 although the bone never completely re-grew over the holes.\n\nThree of the 12 skulls showed only slight signs of healing around the trepanation hole, suggesting that their owners only survived between two and eight weeks after the operation. Two of these individuals were women between 20 and 35 years of age. The third was an elderly person between 50 and 70 years old, whose sex could not be determined.\n\nThe other eight skulls showed more advanced healing. Based on what we know about bone healing today, these individuals probably survived for at least four years after their operations.\n\nIt appeared as if all of these people were trepanned while they were completely healthy\n\nThese eight survivors included all five of the people from the mass grave near Rostov-on-Don, whose bizarrely-trepanned skulls first attracted Batieva's attention almost 20 years ago.\n\nThe two men, two women and one adolescent girl had all survived with their obelion holes for years. The girl, who based on her skeleton was between 14 and 16 years old, must have been trepanned when she was no older than 12, and possibly much younger.\n\nIt is still possible that these 12 people were suffering from diseases or head injuries. In that case, the trepanning operation may have worked for at least eight of them.\n\nBut it is also possible that Batieva and her colleagues are right, and these people were trepanned for a ritual purpose. If that is true, we can only guess at what benefits they received \u2013 or believed they had received \u2013 throughout the rest of their lives.\n\nJoin over five million BBC Earth fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

In all our output we will treat every subject with an impartiality that reflects the full range of views. We will consider all the relevant facts fairly and with an open mind.\"\n\nResearch shows that, compared to other broadcasters, newspapers and online sites, the BBC is seen as by far the most trusted and impartial news provider in the UK.\n\nEven so, we know that identifying credible journalism on the internet can be a confusing experience. We also know that audiences want to understand more about how BBC journalism is produced.\n\nFor these reasons, BBC News is making even greater efforts to explain what type of information you are reading or watching on our website, who and where the information is coming from, and how a story was crafted the way it was. By doing so, we can help you judge for yourself why BBC News can be trusted.\n\nWe are also making these indicators of trustworthy journalism \"machine-readable\", meaning that they can be picked up by search engines and social media platforms, helping them to better identify reliable sources of information too.\n\nThese indicators comprise the following areas:\n\nBEST PRACTICE\n\nThe BBC has long had its own Editorial Guidelines that apply to all of our content and set out the standards expected of our journalists. To make it easier to see how BBC guidelines are used in our newsroom, we have listed all the relevant sections on this page.\n\nMission Statement: The mission of the BBC is to act in the public interest, serving all audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality and distinctive output and services that inform, educate and entertain. Full details are in the BBC Charter.\n\nOwnership Structure, Funding and Grants: We are independent of outside interests and arrangements that could undermine our editorial integrity.

Policies relating to corrections can be found in the following sections of our Editorial Guidelines.\n\nOur output must be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language. We should be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Claims, allegations, material facts and other content that cannot be corroborated should normally be attributed.\n\nWe are open in acknowledging mistakes when they are made and encourage a culture of willingness to learn from them.\n\nIf an article has been edited since publication to correct a material inaccuracy, a note will be added at the end of the text to signal to the reader there has been an amendment or correction with the date of that change. If there is a small error in a story that does not alter its editorial meaning (eg name misspelling), the correction will be made without an additional note.\n\nUnless content is specifically made available only for a limited time period, there is a presumption that material published online will become part of a permanently accessible archive and will not normally be removed.

We use machine-readable labels in six categories:\n\nNews - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources\n\n- Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources Analysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trends\n\n- Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trends Ask the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience response\n\n- Content created primarily to elicit direct audience response Explainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the news\n\n- Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the news Opinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and data\n\n- BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and data Review - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion\n\nCITATIONS AND REFERENCES\n\nOur output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language. We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation.\n\nWhere BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.\n\nWhenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nFor in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods."},

has said charges that US actor Jussie Smollett staged a hoax hate crime against himself are \"utterly outrageous\" and \"despicable\" if true.\n\nThe 36-year-old African-American actor is accused of filing a fake police report claiming he was the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.\n\nJudge John Fitzgerald Lyke, who is also black, said the \"most vile\" part of the incident was the use of a noose.\n\nPolice say he staged the attack because he was \"dissatisfied with his salary\".\n\nThe star's lawyers issued a strongly-worded statement after the hearing, calling it an \"organised law enforcement spectacle\" and describing Mr Smollett as \"a young man of impeccable character\".\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Jussie Smollett emerged from the Cook County Court complex after posting 10% of a $100,000 bond in Chicago\n\nWhat happened in court?\n\n\"That symbol conjures up such evil in this country's history,\" Judge Lyke said of a rope that Mr Smollett claimed the attackers had hung round his neck, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe judge's comments at Thursday's court appearance alluded to the racist lynchings of thousands of black Americans in the post-American Civil War era.\n\nMr Smollett, who stars on the TV series Empire, is suspected of paying two brothers to stage the attack on himself.\n\nThe siblings are co-operating with the investigation, police say.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson: \"Smollett dragged city's reputation through mud\"\n\nChicago officials say Mr Smollett also sent a racist letter to himself at a Fox studio before staging the attack.\n\nJudge Lyke set Mr Smollett's bail at $100,000 (\u00a376,000), which requires him to submit

There were also no witnesses.\n\nInvestigators managed to track and identify two men who appeared on video footage near where the actor said he had been attacked through a ride-sharing app.\n\nThe men - Ola and Abel Osundairo - had left the US for Nigeria following the alleged attack and were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned last week.\n\nThey were released without charges after providing information that \"shifted the trajectory of the investigation\", police said.\n\nOne of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire, a hit Fox show that depicts the lives of a music mogul and his family in Chicago.\n\nPolice say they have a cheque that Mr Smollett signed and that he had agreed to pay $3,500 for the brothers' participation.\n\nSupt Johnson said that Mr Smollett had told at least one of the brothers that he was \"dissatisfied\" with his salary from Fox.\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post, Mr Smollett was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role in Empire, which has about 18 episodes per season.\n\nImage copyright FOX via Getty Images Image caption Jussie Smollett (left) pictured in an episode of Empire\n\nInvestigators said on Thursday that some minor scrapes on Mr Smollett's face were probably self-inflicted.\n\nSupt Johnson said Mr Smollett first \"attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language\" to himself at Fox studios.\n\nPolice had confirmed in early February that white powder - later identified as aspirin - was in the letter.\n\nDuring another news conference on Thursday, police said Mr Smollett had also claimed that three days before the attack he received an unidentified phone call from a man who uttered a homophobic slur then hung up.\n\nHe told police that incident happened near a surveillance camera. It was the same camera that police say Mr Smollett would later point out to the Osundairo brothers in preparation for the alleged hoax attack.\n\nOn Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show two people buying materials, including balaclavas, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers.\n\nMr Smollett turned himself in early on Thursday.\n\nFox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which make Empire, issued a statement on Thursday saying they were \"evaluating the situation\" and \"considering our options.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Democratic White House hopefuls Cory Booker and Kamala Harris both called the incident a \"modern-day lynching\".\n\nMs Harris, a California senator, on Thursday said she was \"sad, frustrated, and disappointed\".\n\nPresident Trump tweeted his condemnation after the police news conference of Mr Smollett's \"racist and dangerous comments\"."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://bbc.com/news/world/us_and_canada", "text": "How May summoned up her inner Trump for her Brexit address\n\nThe US president has enjoyed giving advice to the British leader over Brexit.

Time Magazine senior editor Ryan Teague Beckwith has described trying to keep up with the twists in the Mueller investigation as akin to understanding the plot of a Russian novel by listening to a book club conversation.\n\nNow, at last, perhaps we will see the full manuscript. Or at least the CliffsNotes (that's York Notes to you Brits).\n\nOr maybe we won't.\n\nIf it all seems confusing, that's because no-one knows exactly what happens next - just that something may be about to happen soon.\n\nHow soon is 'soon'?\n\nAccording to multiple news reports, Mr Mueller's investigation could be completed within days. Several times we've been told it could come as soon as \"tomorrow\".\n\nIs that soon enough for you?\n\nJust because the Mueller investigation is drawing to a close, however, doesn't mean we'll know all the details immediately - or ever.\n\nThe notoriously tight-lipped former FBI director could simply announce that his work is done, pack his bags and go back to a private life of golf clubs, corporate boards, academic speaking engagements and trips to the Apple store Genius Bar.\n\nWait, won't there be a final 'Mueller Report' with all the juicy details?\n\nNot necessarily. In fact, probably not.\n\nIt doesn't seem likely there will be a detailed investigative narrative presented to the public similar to the multi-tome report produced by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr back in 1998.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Boxes and boxes of the Starr report\n\nMr Starr's wide-ranging investigation that started with a real-estate inquiry and ended up scouring Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was governed by a federal statute with different rules. And Mr Starr himself - a former judge and Republican administration lawyer - was a different kind of man to the by-the-books ex-Marine Mueller.\n\nMr Mueller's probe is conducted under the auspices of the Justice Department and is governed by its regulations.\n\nThe special counsel's obligations at the conclusion of his work are to provide a \"confidential report\" to Attorney General Bill Barr explaining his prosecutorial decisions.\n\nMr Barr must then provide the top members of the Senate and House Judiciary committees with a brief explanation of any actions taken - or instances where he overruled the special counsel's proposed action.\n\nIt is up to the attorney general to decide whether it would be in the \"public interest\" to make any of these reports or communications accessible to the rest of us.\n\nTraditionally the Justice Department has been reluctant to provide information about investigations that do not lead to criminal prosecution. That was a guideline notably violated by former FBI Director James Comey during his July 2016 press statement outlining the results of a federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Barack Obama's secretary of state.\n\nIt would be ironic, to say the least, if the resulting political fallout from Mr Comey's decision - which Ms Clinton's campaign believes dealt a mortal wound - is cited by Justice Department officials to defend a decision to keep confidential damaging details of the Mueller investigation involving Donald Trump.\n\nWhat will Bill Barr do?\n\nThis is the million-dollar question.\n\nIn his testimony during his January Senate confirmation hearings, Mr Barr was repeatedly pressed by Democrats to promise he would make public any findings or reports produced by the Mueller investigation.\n\nHe demurred.\n\n\"My objective and goal is to get as much as I can of the information to Congress and the public,\" he told Senator Dianne Feinstein. \"I am going to try to get the information out there consistent with these regulations and to the extent I have discretion, I will exercise that discretion to do that.\"\n\nHis answers left considerable wiggle room. He could view the Justice Department's special counsel regulations as a ceiling or a floor - a minimum requirement of disclosure that can be exceeded or a limit to what he can reveal, given confidentiality requirements and prosecutorial guidelines.\n\nSo we may not know anything?\n\nIt's certainly a possibility. Or if we do learn something, it could take a while to render it into a form for public consumption (or, given the way things work in Washington, to leak).\n\nImagine the scene in Washington, as the political world learns Mr Mueller has provided his findings to Mr Barr and then waits - for hours, days, maybe even weeks - to learn what, if anything, will come of it.\n\nThere is another possibility, however.\n\nUp until now, Mr Mueller has spoken through his court filings, which are rich in detail and new revelations. While Mr Mueller's report to the attorney general will be confidential, it may not be his final word at the conclusion of his investigations.\n\nThere may be more indictments to come.\n\nOver the course of the last 21 months, Mr Mueller - in his prosecutorial documents - has explained how Russian agents and operatives allegedly gathered information about the US political process, initiated a social media campaign to influence and enflame American political views, funded on-the-ground political activities, and hacked the emails and files of top Democratic operatives in an effort to damage Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nHe has prosecuted multiple members of the president's inner campaign circle for a variety of misdeeds, including obstruction of justice and lying about Russian contacts.\n\nHe helped strike a deal with Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, which unearthed evidence of Trump business negotiations with Russian officials conducted in the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHe indicted a Trump confidant, Roger Stone, for lying about his contacts with Wikileaks, the organisation he says was the conduit through which Russia injected its purloined material into the American political bloodstream.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe special counsel could be building a prosecutorial path that leads to the White House, with the final stones about to be set. Court-watchers note multiple sealed indictments have been filed in the federal courts used by Mr Mueller's team over the past few months. Those could be political and legal bombs, with their fuses lit.\n\nOr they could be duds.\n\nThat's it, then?\n\nHardly. Even if the Mueller investigation closes up shop and there is no \"report\", there are no new indictments and the attorney general's public pronouncements provide few details, it's not the end of the story.\n\nThere are a number of cases initiated by the special counsel - involving Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and deputy campaign aide Rick Gates - that still await final sentencing.\n\nFormer campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been jailed for fraud and awaits sentencing for crimes related to his lobbying.\n\nLong-time Trump adviser Mr Stone has yet to go to trial on his charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Mr Mueller has handed this prosecution over to government lawyers. There's also a special counsel case against Concord Management and Consulting, which Mr Mueller has charged with assisting Russia's 2016 social media election-meddling campaign.\n\nMeanwhile there's a plethora of other ongoing investigations that are being run independently of the special counsel's office. Federal investigators in New York are looking into possible election-law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses and misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee.\n\nThe US attorneys in Washington and Virginia also have their hands full, with the espionage case involving Russian Maria Butina and an unregistered foreign lobbying prosecution of Mr Flynn's business associates.\n\nThere are also state-level investigations of Mr Trump's charitable foundation and Trump Organization tax filings, as well as an ongoing lawsuit by Maryland and the District of Columbia alleging that the president, through his business dealings, is violating a constitutional rule prohibiting the acceptance of money from foreign governments while in office.\n\nMr Mueller may exit the stage, but the drama will continue."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47325381", "text": "Video\n\nThe rare phenomenon happens when light hits a waterfall tumbling down El Capitan.

A detailed analysis will now be done. \u2014 HAYABUSA2@JAXA (@haya2e_jaxa) February 22, 2019 Report\n\nHayabusa-2 had earlier dropped a small, reflective, beanbag-like \"target marker\" on to Ryugu. This was used as a guide as the spacecraft descended to the rough surface of the asteroid.\n\nControllers were aiming for the centre of a circle, some 6m in diameter, located about 4-5m away from the target marker.\n\nThe Japanese space agency (Jaxa) had originally planned to carry out the touchdown operation in October last year. But the asteroid's surface was found to be much more rugged than expected, with numerous, hefty boulders making it hard to find a location that was large and flat enough to sample.\n\nControllers had hoped they would have an area of about 100m in diameter to target. But because of the surface properties, this had to be reduced to a 6m circle for what team members are calling a \"pinpoint touchdown\".\n\nThe sampler horn that extends out from the bottom of the spacecraft has a length of 1m. It's therefore vital that there are no boulders more than 50cm in height at the landing site, to reduce the chances that the body of the spacecraft could hit a rock.\n\nImage copyright Jaxa Image caption The sampler horn will be used to collect material for delivery to Earth in 2020\n\nUnexpected surface properties also have the potential to affect the amount of material collected. Before arriving at Ryugu, researchers had expected the surface to be covered in a powdery layer of fine-grained material - the regolith.\n\nIn fact, the upper layer turned out to be akin to gravel, consisting of rocky chunks that are centimetre-sized or larger.\n\nProf Fitzsimmons told BBC News: \"This was a surprise, as other near-Earth asteroids we have visited previously have shown areas dominated by small particles.\n\n\"It might be due to the carbon-rich composition, as the previous NEAs are composed of silicate rock, which are more Earth-like. But the shape of Ryugu also implies it was spinning much faster in the past, so it's possible this could have affected the particles' sizes in some fashion.\"\n\nScientists carried out additional tests in Japan to determine whether the sample material could still be gathered by the spacecraft.\n\nThey used a container of artificial gravel with a similar size distribution to that on Ryugu. In a vacuum chamber, they fired a tantalum bullet identical to that used by Hayabusa-2 into the gravel.\n\nAccording to Jaxa, the results of the test exceeded expectations, with the tantalum projectile yielding fragments of rock in size ranges that should easily pass through the sampler horn.\n\nThis suggests that Hayabusa-2 should have been able to collect a sample.\n\nIn September, Hayabusa-2 deployed two robotic \"hoppers\" that propelled themselves across the surface of Ryugu, sending back images and other data.\n\nThen, in October, the \"mothership\" despatched a French-German instrument package called Mascot to the surface.\n\nLater this year, perhaps in March or April, Jaxa plans to detonate an explosive charge that will punch a crater into the surface of Ryugu.\n\nHayabusa-2 would then descend into the crater to collect fresh samples of material that have not been altered by aeons of exposure to space.\n\n\"We know that the surfaces of asteroids are changed over time by bombardment with energetic particles from the Sun and interstellar space,\" said Alan Fitzsimmons.\n\n\"Yet studies with telescopes show that this 'space weathering' affects the surfaces of carbon-rich asteroids differently to those mostly made from more rock-like silicate minerals. We don't know why this is, and the fresh sub-surface samples from Ruygu will play a very important role in understanding how this happens.\"\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-47319788", "text": "Image copyright Michael Tullberg Image caption Tork was diagnosed with a rare form of tongue cancer in 2009\n\nPeter Tork, a member of the made-for-TV pop group The Monkees, has died at the age of 77.\n\n\"There are no words right now... heartbroken over the loss of my Monkee brother Peter Tork,\" bandmate Micky Dolenz tweeted.\n\nTork, who played keyboard and bass for the group, was diagnosed with a rare form of tongue cancer in 2009.\n\nThe Monkees were huge in the 1960s, with hits like I'm A Believer and Daydream Believer.\n\nA post on Tork's official Facebook page said \"the devastating news\" was being shared \"with beyond-heavy and broken hearts\".\n\nIt said: \"Our friend, mentor, teacher, and amazing soul, Peter Tork, has passed from this world.\"\n\nA message posted on the band's official Twitter page said that Tork had \"passed peacefully\" and invited fans to share their favourite memories by adding their comments.\n\nThe family later released a statement in which they said they were \"saddened\" by Tork's death, but \"grateful\" for the \"attentive energy and dedication of Peter's fans worldwide\".\n\n\"Peter's energy, intelligence, silliness and curiosity were traits that for decades brought laughter and enjoyment to millions, including those of us closest to him.\n\n\"We ask that our family have time and space to grieve in privacy,\" it added.\n\nTork's contemporary, Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, tweeted:\n\nSkip Twitter post by @BrianWilsonLive I\u2019m sad to hear about Peter Tork passing.

He learned to play multiple instruments, including the piano and the French horn.\n\nAs recently as October last year, he addressed \"some concerns\" about his health on Facebook.\n\n\"While it is true that my health has required a little more attention these days, I'm feeling pretty good,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Monkees ran for just two television series, but that was enough to win an Emmy Award for outstanding comedy.\n\nDiscussing the show in an interview with Guitar World in 2013, Tork said: \"I refute any claims that any four guys could've done what we did.\"\n\nHe added: \"There was a magic to that collection... they got the right guys.\"\n\nIn 2012, following the death of Jones from a heart attack in February at the age of 66, Tork reunited with Nesmith and Dolenz for a US tour in what was the musicians' first live shows together in 15 years.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But when his friends nearly died he thought again, says the BBC's Sue Mitchell.\n\nAzis Hanna, his wife Maryam, and their five-year-old daughter, Chia, arrived in Dunkirk in October and made more than 20 attempts to reach the UK before finally succeeding last weekend, in the back of a lorry.\n\nFor a while he had considered making the trip in an inflatable rubber boat. The smugglers made it sound quite safe, promising that one of them would travel in the boat with the migrants for 14 miles.\n\n\"When you go to English water they then call the police, the police come to help take you to England. Every smuggler says like this,\" Azis says.\n\nAt this point the smugglers themselves would travel back to France in an accompanying boat, the story went.\n\nBut the experiences of two friends from the Dunkirk camp filled Azis with horror.\n\nIranian Christians Bahador and Shoku, together with their children Maryam and Brinyamin, were driven to a beach south of the ferry port one winter morning and climbed into a small boat with six others.\n\nAbout 15 minutes after setting off, it capsized - and there were no life jackets. Seven-year-old Maryam says she was one of the only ones who could swim.\n\n\"This water was so cold, so much cold. My feet were going cold, it made me want to die,\" she says. \"I saw my brother, but couldn't get him.\"\n\nFortunately Bahador was able to lift them on top of the upturned boat.\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to Dangerous Crossings on Radio 4 at 11:00 on Wednesday 20 February\n\nOr catch up later online\n\n\"The sea was going up and down so much,\" Maryam says. \"It was strong and dark. My mum was crying and praying and others were shouting for help. They said we were going to die.\"\n\nEventually they were rescued but both children had to be treated in hospital for hypothermia.\n\nImage caption Bahador and his children, Brinyamin and Maryam\n\nThe other story that put Azis off the boat crossing involved his friend Solomon, and Solomon's partner, Siree, both also Iranian Christians.\n\nThey had already been at sea for hours when their engine failed. As efforts were made to restart it, the boat began to fill with a mixture of salt water and fuel - which burned their skin.\n\n\"Our skin was burning, just so painful. We were just scared. Somebody was crying, someone was praying. The boat was drifting,\" Solomon says.\n\n\"We were asking God, 'Why, what is happening to us? Why?' Me too, I ask God, 'Why God you take me from Iran to this sea to die here? Nobody knows where I am.' Three hours after our engine went off we were still at sea.\"\n\nIt was dark when a small boat - British, Solomon thinks - picked them up and transferred them to a French vessel, and they were taken to a hospital in France.\n\nImage caption Bahador's son, Brinyamin, at the camp in Dunkirk\n\nAfter hearing these stories, Azis told smugglers in Dunkirk that he wanted to make the journey by lorry. His mother borrowed \u00a310,000, using her house as security, and paid the money to the smugglers' associates in Iraq. Then a long series of failed attempts began.\n\nSometimes they were found by sniffer dogs at the French ports. On other occasions, the lorries set off in the wrong direction, heading into France towards Spain or Romania. On one occasion they climbed into a refrigerated lorry, but Chia could not stand the cold and started feeling unwell.\n\nAzis says the French police took a relaxed attitude if they caught him, often wishing him better luck next time.\n\nHis successful crossing took place on Saturday. They were called by the smugglers during the day and travelled by bus from Dunkirk to a lorry park in Belgium. There they were put in the back of a Romanian lorry with another family and entered the UK via the Eurotunnel. They stayed hidden until Northampton, when they created a disturbance and the surprised driver let them out.\n\nTackling smugglers\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDCI Neil Cripps of the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit says investigators sometimes have to allow unsafe boats to set off in order to gather evidence against the smugglers.\n\n\"To get our best evidence and to do a long-term permanent disruption to this crime route, we have to balance and juggle an element of risk to people.\"\n\nAn Iraqi Kurd smuggler operating in northern France, using the name Johno, says he spent four years in jail for human trafficking - then returned to the illegal business after his release.\n\nThey hid in woods until one of Azis's cousins, who is already living in the UK, could pick them up. Hours later, Azis reported to a police station to start his claim for asylum.\n\nAzis says life in Iraq had become dangerous for him because of an earlier attempt to reach the UK as a teenager, 15 years ago. On that occasion his travelling companion had died, as he jumped from a slowly moving lorry. Years later the man's uncle contacted Azis out of the blue, blaming him for the tragedy, he says, and threatening to kill his daughter if he failed to pay \u00a350,000 in compensation.\n\nAzis did not think of staying in France, because he speaks English, has relatives in the UK, and because the UK government helps refugees, he says. \"They give houses and everything,\" he says. \"In France it isn't like that. They do help, but nothing like that.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I am overjoyed and thank God for this. England is like heaven to me. No-one can hurt us here and we can sleep properly for the first time in months. My daughter can start school and get an education. She will be very clever and maybe even a doctor.\"\n\nImage caption British volunteer Rob Lawrie with Azis's daughter, Chia, in Dunkirk\n\nDCI Neil Cripps of the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit says increased vigilance at ferry ports, and the increased risk of getting caught when travelling by lorry, is making sea crossings more attractive for migrants.\n\n\"I am predicting, probably in the spring when the weather becomes calmer, that dinghies will start to increase,\" he says.\n\nDespite his family's disastrous experience, Azis's friend, Bahador, is one of those thinking of attempting the boat crossing again.\n\n\"We want to get away from here,\" he says.\n\n\"And we cannot come back to Iran because I am a Christian and would definitely die. The sea is dangerous, but Iran is more dangerous.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nImage copyright Colin Freeman\n\nMore than 3,000 Nigerian migrants who failed to reach Europe, have been flown home by the International Organization for Migration.

My wife took me to the out-of-hours doctor that night and by this point I was really unwell and could barely move. But I was given an anti-sickness injection and then I was sent home.\"\n\nHours later he collapsed. He was taken to hospital and suffered two cardiac arrests. His body went into shock with the sepsis and his organs started to shut down.\n\nAfter eight days in a coma, Ryan woke up and made an almost complete recovery.\n\n\"No-one mentioned sepsis, although looking back I had all the symptoms,\" said Ryan.\n\n\"It's hard to diagnose, so if this test had been around it could have made all the difference to what happened with me.\"\n\nThe UK Sepsis Trust estimates that earlier diagnosis and treatment across the UK would save at least 14,000 lives a year.\n\nDr Ron Daniels, the trust's chief executive officer, said: \"Any kind of test that enables us to identify sepsis earlier, before symptoms even present themselves, could help save even more lives and bring us closer to our goal of ending preventable deaths from sepsis.\n\n\"Systems like this are so important as, with every hour before the right antibiotics are administered, risk of death increases.\n\n\"No test is perfect in the identification of sepsis, so it's crucial we continue to educate clinicians to think sepsis in order to prompt them to use such tests.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rachel Day was a healthy, happy 29-year-old when she was struck down by sepsis\n\nUpdate 19 February 2019: This article has been amended to more accurately reflect the stage of development that this new rapid test has reached and the continuing difficulties in diagnosing sepsis."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://bbc.com/news/in_pictures", "text": "The human cost of insulin in America\n\nDiabetics in the US are rationing insulin - and dying.

Typically in Africa and Asia that would mean a melanistic leopard - a black leopard.\n\n\"In South America it would be a melanistic jaguar - a black jaguar.\n\n\"Black panther is a looser term.\"\n\nWill captured a spotted leopard on one of the camera traps, which could be the black leopard's dad.\n\nImage copyright Burrard-Lucas Photography Image caption Dad?\n\nYou don't need two black leopards to make one, but both parents need to carry the recessive gene for melanism.\n\nWill says it's hard to say how many leopards there are in East Africa, given how secretive they are\n\n\"And then add to that only a tiny, tiny fraction would be black?\n\n\"There might be a handful in east Africa that are black.\"\n\nImage copyright Burrard-Lucas Photography Image caption A truly rare sight\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra -

the schoolgirl who fled London to join the Islamic State group in Syria - has been stripped of her UK citizenship after expressing a desire to return.\n\nIt is only possible to strip someone of their UK nationality if they are eligible for citizenship elsewhere - and it is thought Ms Begum could be a Bangladeshi citizen because she was born to a mother believed to be Bangladeshi.\n\nHowever, Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has said Ms Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizen and there is \"no question\" of her being allowed into the country.\n\nIs she entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship?\n\nExpert lawyers with experience in Bangladeshi citizenship cases have told the BBC that under Bangladesh law, a UK national like Ms Begum, if born to a Bangladeshi parent, is automatically a Bangladeshi citizen. That means that such a person would have dual nationality.\n\nIf the person remains in the UK, their Bangladeshi citizenship remains in existence but dormant.\n\nUnder this \"blood line\" law, Bangladeshi nationality and citizenship lapse when a person reaches the age of 21, unless they make efforts to activate and retain it.\n\nSo, it is Ms Begum's age, 19, that is likely - in part - to have given Home Office lawyers and the home secretary reassurance there was a legal basis for stripping her of her UK citizenship.\n\nIn 2018, the government lost an appeal case brought by two British citizens of Bangladeshi origin who were stripped of their citizenship when they were abroad.\n\nThe Special Immigration Appeals Commission ruled that E3 and N3 had not tried to retain their citizenship before they reached the age of 21, and so it had automatically lapsed.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shamima Begum: \"I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me\"\n\nThat meant that the decision to strip them of their UK citizenship had rendered them stateless.\n\nMs Begum's case is different. Her Bangladeshi citizenship, if established, would remain intact until she reaches 21, even if she has never visited the country or made active efforts to retain her citizenship.\n\nWhat are the rights of her child?\n\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid has suggested that the decision to remove Ms Begum's UK citizenship will have no impact on her baby son's nationality.\n\nWhile refusing to comment on individual cases, he told the Commons: \"Children should not suffer. So, if a parent does lose their British citizenship, it does not affect the rights of their child.\"\n\nLord Carlile, former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the baby may also be entitled to Bangladeshi and Dutch nationality - Ms Begum's husband is a Dutch convert to Islam, who she married in Syria.\n\nAs a British citizen, Ms Begum's child would have a right to enter the UK. However the British government has no consular staff in Syria to help get him out of the country.\n\nEven if that were possible, the question of whether he should be separated from his mother would open up a whole new moral conundrum.\n\nAnd after losing two children to illness in Syria, Ms Begum seems desperate to keep her third.\n\nWhy is it illegal to be stateless?\n\nUnder international law, a stateless person is someone who is \"not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law\".\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to a nationality and \"no-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of their nationality\".\n\nThe home secretary has the power to strip an individual of their British citizenship on the basis that it is \"conducive to the public good\", as long as the person would not become stateless as a result.\n\nThe Home Office says that the exception to this is where the UK government believes the person is eligible to acquire the citizenship of another country - even if they do not currently have dual nationality.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC asked people in London's Bethnal Green, where Shamima Begum went to school, whether she should be allowed back to the UK\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott has accused Mr Javid of breaching the declaration by stripping Ms Begum of her UK citizenship.\n\nHowever, Mr Javid has said the Home Office would never take that decision if someone only had one nationality.\n\nDoes this create a two-tier system?\n\nEffectively, yes.\n\nIf both your parents were born in the UK and you do not have dual nationality, it would not be possible for the Home Office to strip you of your British citizenship, as this would leave you stateless.\n\nBut for a British child of a dual national or immigrant, who is eligible for another nationality, it would be.\n\nLord Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said it \"effectively brings about two classes of citizenship\".\n\nCould Ms Begum have her UK citizenship reinstated?\n\nShe would need to bring a legal challenge against the home secretary's decision to strip her of her citizenship.\n\nThis would be heard at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac).\n\nIf her family disagreed with that panel's decision, they could appeal on a point of law to a higher court, and ultimately to the UK Supreme Court.\n\nSince 2015, Siac has heard seven cases involving loss of citizenship, of which two were successful.\n\nBut it can take years before a case is brought to Siac - so there could be a lot of cases that are still waiting to be heard.\n\nHow many UK nationals have lost their citizenship?\n\nUntil very recently, the power to strip an individual of their citizenship was rarely used.\n\nIn 2016 it was used just 14 times, but this increased to 104 in 2017 - the latest year data is available."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47311145", "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson: \"Smollett dragged city's reputation through mud\"\n\nUS actor Jussie Smollett staged a fake attack on himself because he was \"dissatisfied with his salary\", Chicago police say.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a news conference that he \"took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career\".\n\nMr Smollett, 36, is charged with filing a false police report after he said he was the victim of a homophobic attack.\n\nPolice say he also had sent a racist letter to himself at a Fox studio.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Smollett appeared in court and was ordered to submit a bond of $10,000 and surrender his passport.\n\nJudge John Fitzgerald Lyke called the charges \"utterly outrageous\" and \"despicable\" if true.\n\nThe star of the TV series Empire is suspected of paying two brothers to stage the attack.

You should do the exercise you enjoy\n\nJoe loves doing pull-ups and press-ups, and working the big muscle groups with bodyweight moves but, he says, the important thing is to do what you enjoy.

You can be veggie and still get enough protein\n\nJoe still eats meat but he\u2019s now cooking a lot more veggie meals in the evening. His new book \u2013 Veggie Lean in 15 \u2013 has helped him realise \u201chow yummy veggie food can be.\u201d\n\nYou can get a decent amount of protein from vegetarian food, says Joe. An animal source like chicken is a full protein source: it has all the amino acids, which you can\u2019t necessarily get from a vegetable. But when you combine things together \u2013 like quinoa, pulses, chickpeas and lentils \u2013 then you can get the complete amino acids. Combine with nuts (and eggs and cheese if you\u2019re not vegan) and you can still build that lean muscle, he says.\n\n8. It\u2019s never too late to get fit\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re really unfit and you want to get into fitness, just starting at home with some really basic, gentle stuff is going to build up your confidence and your fitness. This way, if you do decide to join a gym, you\u2019re not going to be really intimidated and just run out the door.\u201d\n\nCrucially, says the Body Coach, \u201cit\u2019s never too late to get fit; it\u2019s never too late to feel good and confident and change the way you eat and train.

So he survived\u2026 until the country stopped executing people altogether.\n\nByson Kaula says jealous neighbours were responsible for him being found guilty of murder. It was 1992 and murder in those days carried a mandatory death sentence.\n\nBrought up in a small village in southern Malawi, Byson had made enough money working in the gas industry in Johannesburg, South Africa, to return home and buy land. He employed five people and grew fruit, wheat, maize, and cassava.\n\n\"That is when my sad times began,\" he says.\n\nNeighbours attacked one of his employees, Byson says, leaving him badly injured. The man couldn't walk without assistance, and while helping him get to the toilet - navigating steps that were slippery after heavy rain - Byson fell and dropped him. The man died later in hospital, and Byson - then in his 40s - was charged with murder.\n\nIn court, Byson's neighbours testified against him.\n\nHis mother, Lucy, sitting at the back of the courtroom, couldn't hear the sentence being read out and had to ask what was happening. When she was told he had been sentenced to death, \"tears rolled from my eyes down my chest,\" she says.\n\nThis was towards the end of the totalitarian government of Hastings Banda, which had controlled the country since 1964. Byson vividly remembers the horror of waiting for his turn at what he calls \"the killing machine\".\n\n\"When I was told: 'You can go now to the condemned section waiting for your time to be hanged' - oh, I felt as if I was already dead.\"\n\nAt that time, there was just one executioner - a South African who travelled between several countries in the region, carrying out hangings. When he arrived in Malawi, once every couple of months, the prisoners on death row knew that time, for some of them, had run out.\n\nOne day Byson remembers being told that his name was on the list of 21 people to be hanged within hours. A guard told him that executions would begin at 13:00 and that he should \"just start praying\".\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to Life After Death Row, on Assignment, on the BBC World Service, on 21 February\n\nClick here for transmission times, or to listen online\n\nThey continued until 15:00, when the executioner stopped work. But he had not reached the end of the list. Three people, including Byson, would have to wait until he returned.\n\n\"He was the only one operating that machine. And on that day, I understand he said: 'No it's too much, I'll come again next month,'\" Byson says.\n\nThe same thing happened twice more, Byson says. The list was drawn up, but the hangman didn't finish it - and each time, by chance, Byson was among those left alive at the end of the day. On the third occasion, all the prisoners on the list were executed except him, he says.\n\nIn a way he was lucky, but the experience took its toll on him and he attempted suicide twice - only to survive this too.\n\nAfter the establishment of multi-party democracy in Malawi in 1994, all executions came to a halt. The death sentence is still given out, even today, but no president has signed a death warrant for 25 years. Prisoners either languish on death row for years or have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nIn time, Byson was moved from death row to the main part of Zomba Central Prison, and it looked as though he would spend the rest of his life there. He became heavily involved in the prison education programme, both studying and teaching. But he had no hope of ever being released.\n\nThen, in 2007, a historic case changed everything.\n\nA drug user who admitted killing his stepson, but argued that he had been temporarily insane, went to court to challenge the mandatory death sentence for murder. He argued that this breached the right to a fair trial, and the right to protection from \"inhuman and degrading treatment\" - both guaranteed by Malawi's constitution - and the court agreed. In some cases of murder the perpetrator was more culpable than others, it ruled, and there should therefore be different levels of punishment.\n\nThis meant that all mandatory death sentences had to be reviewed.\n\nOf nearly 170 prisoners eligible for resentencing, 139 have so far been released. According to the legal charity Reprieve, many had mental health problems or were intellectually disabled. More than half of those entitled to a new hearing turned out to have no court record at all - it was unclear why they were even in prison.\n\nWhen lawyers said that they wanted to take Byson back to court he initially resisted, as he had been so terrified by his first experience. But he gave in, and when the judge told him he was free to leave immediately, he was stunned.\n\n\"The prison warders said can you get out of the accused box. But I couldn't stand up. I was just shivering, all my body was so weak\u2026 It was just as if I was dreaming. I could not believe what the judge had said.\"\n\nByson wasn't the only person whose life had been changed by his sentence.\n\nHis mother Lucy had visited every year during his incarceration. She would save her earnings from a year's work farming cotton to make the journey to the prison in Zomba, bringing Byson as many provisions as she could carry.\n\nOn the day of Byson's resentencing in 2015, she wasn't there, but her younger son was. When he rang to tell her the news, she took a while to believe what he was saying. Then, she says, she \"jumped around like a lamb - a young lamb\u2026 my heart was filled with joy\".\n\nByson was taken to a halfway house to help him learn new skills and make the transition back to normal life after 23 years in prison. Already in his 60s, he was the oldest person they'd ever had there.\n\nHe now goes back as a volunteer at weekends, to advise other ex-prisoners who are going through the same experience.\n\nImage caption Byson has plans for those bricks\n\nThe land Byson used to farm is now overgrown. His wife died during the long years he was in prison and his six children have grown up and moved away.\n\nHe lives alone, but takes good care of his mother, now in her 80s.\n\n\"During my imprisonment, all I was worrying about was my mother\u2026 Being her first-born, I would do everything possible for her. Now that I'm back, I don't let her go farming or do hard jobs. I have got other people to do the jobs for her. She doesn't go to the field. I do it myself.\"\n\nHis next project is to build her a new brick house.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nJust over a year ago, Greek pilot Vasileios Vasileiou checked into a luxury hilltop hotel in Kabul.

And it makes sense to have kept it under $2,000 even if only for the psychological effect that has.\"\n\nImage copyright Samsung Image caption The phone comes in four colours\n\nBut another market watcher still had doubts.\n\n\"In theory, foldables are hugely attractive: they pack a giant screen into a small design,\" commented Neil Mawston from the research firm Strategy Analytics.\n\n\"But in reality, consumers don't know exactly how they will work, and the applications for them are still fairly immature.\n\n\"You can look back at history at the dual-screen folder phones that ZTE and NEC and others release. They haven't sold particularly well mostly due to price and lack of distribution.\n\n\"So, there's good potential, but still a lot of uncertainty.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Samsung shows off how its foldable phone works\n\nDave Lee, North America technology reporter\n\nIn the short demonstration we saw today, Samsung's use case of watching entertainment, playing games and app multi-tasking will make a lot of sense for a lot of people. This is a tremendously creative feat of engineering. Folding screens seem like a good idea.\n\nWhat won't work, however, is the price. I've been at many launch events like this, and normally the worst case scenario for the firms putting on the show is a lack of applause when the price is announced. Today we saw something worse - loud grumbles, even some laughter. $1,980? Simply too much.\n\nAlso, I wonder about some other aspects of this phone we can't judge yet as we haven't had a chance to hold it. When Samsung's head of mobile placed it into his suit pocket on stage, it landed with all the grace of a cartoon anvil.\n\nImage copyright Samsung\n\nSo: possibly heavy, with two likely-hot batteries, and a huge price tag.\n\nCreative, sure? Practical? For me, Samsung has fallen short - but the effort should excite gadget fans who have been longing for something different for so long. I suspect this device will have people flocking to stores to see it up close, if not to actually purchase it.\n\nGalaxy S series\n\nThe S10 series is likely to remain Samsung's focus when it comes to sales for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe S10 and S10+ will cost more than the phones they supersede - beginning at \u00a3799 and \u00a3899 respectively when they go on sale on 8 March.\n\nBut the S10e means the Galaxy S range now starts at a lower price-point - \u00a3669 - albeit with lower specifications to match.\n\nThe S10 5G is yet to be priced and only has a vague \"summer\" release planned.\n\nImage caption The S10 family comes in four different sizes, each with a choice of different storage\n\n\"Having a 5G variant is strategically important for Samsung as it gives them the jump on Apple and helps maintain the firm's brand strength and perceived technology leadership,\" commented Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy.\n\n\"It also gives the operators a tier-one brand for their 5G launches.\n\n\"But as far as consumers are concerned, unless you have a very good reason to buy a 5G phone this summer, one of the other three S10 handsets is probably a better investment, and will be viable for use for many years.\"\n\nThe launch comes days before Mobile World Congress in Barcelona - a trade event where Samsung's rivals will unveil new handsets of their own.\n\nThe overall smartphone market shrank in 2018, but Samsung's sales saw a particularly pronounced drop-off as Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers wooed away customers.\n\nCut-out cameras\n\nAll four versions of the S10 are distinguished from last year's models by embedding the front cameras within their displays.\n\nImage caption The phone's selfie camera is surrounded by its screen\n\nSamsung refers to this as being the Infinity O design, but it is more commonly referred to as the \"hole punch\".\n\nThe move allows the phones to feature a thinner top bezel without having the kind of \"notch\" found on many rivals.\n\nIt has, however, caused the firm to ditch the eye iris-scanner introduced in the S8.\n\nSamsung says a new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor placed under the screens of the three higher-end phones offers close to the same level of security, and is more convenient to use than a scanner formerly placed on phone backs.\n\nImage caption A graphic symbol tells users where they need to press to provide a fingerprint\n\nIt is based on a technology unveiled by Qualcomm in 2015.\n\nAll versions of the handset feature wireless charging and introduce the ability to wirelessly charge other compatible devices in turn.\n\nThis mirrors a feature first offered by Huawei's Mate 20.\n\nSamsung demoed the facility at a dual London and San Francisco launch as a way to recharge a new pair of Bluetooth headphones without having to use a separate cable or power mat.\n\nImage caption The phone can be used to send power to the Galaxy Buds' charging case\n\nSmarter photography\n\nAll four devices now feature a 10 megapixel selfie camera and introduce a 16MP \"ultra-wide\" rear version, which offers a slightly larger field-of-view than our eyes.\n\nThe S10+ also has a second selfie camera to help it take depth readings.\n\nOther improvements include:\n\nthe ability to detect 10 additional types of scene, so as to automatically adjust the colours and sharpness to suit the subject. These now include shoes, cats and clothing\n\na \"super steady\" video mode that combines both digital and optical stabilisation to create the kind of smooth footage that would traditionally have required a gimbal or other add-on stabiliser\n\nan Instagram mode makes it easier to upload images to the social network directly from Samsung's camera app\n\nIn addition, the S10+ and S10 5G now offer up to one terabyte of internal storage, which the firm says could appeal to those shooting lots of 4K video or storing many game files.\n\nImage caption The S10 phones can tell when they are taking photos of a shoe and will adjust the image to suit\n\n\"What's positive is that Samsung has moved away from software that nobody wants - like AR emojis and Samsung Cloud - and has gone back to its roots to deliver market-leading hardware,\" commented Ben Stanton, from market analysis firm Canalys.\n\n\"So for the premium part of the market, these are good phones.\n\n\"But my concern is that [they are still] not innovative enough to stop people from looking down to lower-price bands and being drawn into mid-range products from Chinese companies that are super-competitive.\"\n\nHigh and low-end\n\nThe introduction of a lower price tier may help address this.\n\nBut trade-offs for picking the S10e include:\n\na lower-resolution, smaller 5.8in screen that does not curve round the device's sides like the 6.1in and 6.4in displays of the S10 and S10+\n\nno telephoto \"portrait\" rear camera\n\nno heart rate sensor\n\na capacitive fingerprint scanner on its side, rather than the ultrasonic in-screen option of the more expensive phones\n\nBy contrast, the S10 5G benefits from several exclusive features:\n\na 6.7in (17cm) display. For comparison, the Note 9 is 6.4in and the iPhone XS Max 6.5in\n\nfaster wired-charging\n\n3D depth-sensing cameras on its front and rear. These could be used to offer improved facial scans and photo-background blurs, although details have yet to be confirmed\n\nImage caption The S10 5G features three photo cameras and a 3D depth sensor on its rear\n\n\"The phone had to be larger to feature a bigger battery because 5G [data transfers] will drain it much faster,\" commented Mr Stanton.\n\n\"But it was also smart to offer a large screen.\n\n\"The use cases for 5G aren't yet defined, but one potential is to stream 4K video rather than HD. And having a bigger screen makes that more compelling.\"\n\nGalaxy S (2010):\n\nThe original S-series handset was released days ahead of Apple's iPhone 4, and had a bigger 4in screen and microSD card slot in its favour.\n\nAt that point, its main Android rival was the HTC Desire, and although Samsung's device was lighter, thinner, and had a more powerful graphics processor, some reviewers said it felt less \"premium\" in the hand than its competitor.\n\nGalaxy S2 (2011):\n\nThe second-generation device saw its display grow to 4.3in, its rear camera increase in resolution to 8MP, and its processor move over to a dual-core design.\n\nIt was praised for allowing owners to unlock it by pressing the home key, rather than having to press a button on top as before. And although some griped that it still felt plasticky, it sold in its millions - helping Samsung overtake Nokia as the world's bestselling mobile phone-maker.\n\nGalaxy S3 (2012):\n\nThe third-generation model established a trend of including a bigger display but compensating for the growth by shrinking the size of the bezels.\n\nIts innovations included the ability to detect when the screen was being looked at, so as to avoid dimming the image. And it introduced S Voice, allowing users to command music to play and photos to be taken by speaking to it.\n\nGalaxy S4 (2013):\n\nSamsung added further touchless controls to the S4, letting owners scroll through text by making eye movements, and accept calls with a hand wave.\n\nA dual-camera feature also created photos that blended together the views from the front and rear lenses.\n\nSome critics found this all to be a bit gimmicky, and although the handset was a hit, there were reports that its sales fell short of Samsung's expectations.\n\nGalaxy S5 (2014):\n\nThe S5 added a fingerprint scanner, which could be used to authenticate purchases via PayPal.\n\nIt also introduced a black-and-white mode to help save battery life. But predictions that the firm would ditch Android for its in-house operating system Tizen proved to be inaccurate.\n\nGalaxy S6 (2015):\n\nThe S-series split in two in 2015 with a premium-priced Edge version offering a screen that curved round one of its sides.\n\nA metal frame and glass back gave the handsets a more luxury feel, but they ditched water resistance and a microSD slot to make this possible.\n\nGalaxy S7 (2016):\n\nThe seventh-generation phones looked pretty similar to their predecessors, but restored the ability to dunk them in water and slot in extra storage.\n\nOther improvements centred on the camera with better low-light and autofocus capabilities.\n\nGalaxy S8 (2017):\n\nThe S8 and larger S8+ ditched the home button, took Samsung's logo off the front and added the virtual assistant Bixby.\n\nThey also gained an iris scanner, which was billed as \"one of the safest ways\" to keep data private.\n\nAfter scandals involving exploding Note 7s and the arrest of the firm's vice-chairman, the launch helped return the firm to surer footing.\n\nGalaxy S9 (2018):\n\nThe S9 and S9+ gained new camera features including a super-slow-motion video mode and a variable aperture - allowing owners to control how much light reached the sensor.\n\nAR emojis also allowed users to create animated cartoon characters that looked like them.\n\nBut sales were lacklustre, and several months after it was unveiled Samsung acknowledged there had been \"resistance\" to its price.\n\nGalaxy S10 (2019):\n\nCameras that poke out of the screen and four distinct models mark out the latest generation.\n\nBut there are signs Samsung's smartphone dominance is slipping..."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-47313607/barack-obama-you-don-t-need-eight-women-around-you-twerking", "text": "Video\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama offered some advice on self-confidence for young men at an event for his foundation in California.\n\nAsked about masculinity and the pressure on men to \"act a certain way\", Mr Obama criticised the image of some hip hop and rap artists.\n\nHe was joined by NBA player Steph Curry and singer John Legend to mark the fifth anniversary of My Brother's Keeper, an initiative to support males from minority backgrounds."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-47308465", "text": "Image caption Damien Henry said he was \"appalled\" when he saw the jacket in the window of Footasylum, in Nottingham city centre\n\nA clothing firm has removed \"tactical wear\" utility jackets from its stores after a youth worker said they may be mistaken for stab vests.\n\nDamien Henry said he was \"appalled\" when he saw a jacket in the window of Footasylum in Nottingham.\n\nFootasylum said it was \"popular contemporary fashion\" but, due to \"misunderstanding around this product\", it has withdrawn the item.\n\nMr Henry said he believed the move could help save lives.\n\nImage caption \"Utility vests\" are sold by several fashion chains but this design was described as \"tactical wear\" from the \"military collection\"\n\nMr Henry said he works with young people who have been stabbed or shot, and who are involved in gangs.\n\nHe said: \"A child won't look at that and think, 'Oh that's just a fashion item'.

However, many countries have so far been reluctant to do so.\n\nWhy did they want to go to Syria and Iraq?\n\nJihadists began travelling to Iraq in 2003 when a US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein's regime triggered a Sunni insurgency.

But it has declined to speculate on the number of foreign fighters who may have been killed.\n\nThe head of MI5 said in October 2017 that more than 130 Britons who had travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with IS had died.\n\nWhat about those in custody?\n\nAn official from a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said on 18 February that it had about 800 foreign fighters from almost 50 countries in its prisons. At least 700 women and 1,500 children were being held at camps for displaced people, Abdul Karim Omar added.\n\nFew of the SDF's detainees have been identified.

It has also said radicalised women and traumatised minors may pose a threat.\n\nWhat's happening to the children?\n\nMore than 2,000 children of foreign fighters are being detained at prisons in Iraq and at three SDF-run camps in Syria, often in poor conditions with a lack of access to education and basic services.\n\nMost of the children are being held with their mothers. Many of their fathers are detained elsewhere, missing or dead.

But most of their home countries have resisted calls to repatriate them. Officials have said traumatised children may be security threats, or that it is difficult to verify their nationalities.\n\nThe UN has warned that the children may be at risk of becoming stateless, despite having citizenship or a claim to citizenship of a country. It has called for all children under 18 to be repatriated immediately and for the development of specialised child-protection programmes to ensure their full reintegration into society in their home countries.\n\nIn January, two Trinidadian boys taken to Syria by their father were released from an SDF camp and repatriated with the help of Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47309795", "text": "We've only just passed the half-way point of Donald Trump's first term as president, but there's already a host of Democrats racing to stop him from winning a second.\n\nBernie Sanders has thrown his hat into the ring once again, but most of the other candidates are relatively unknown outside the Washington DC bubble.\n\nThe current group already contains a record number of women and looks set to be the most diverse ever.\n\nHere's our rundown of all the candidates that have announced they are running and some others who could join them, including a few wildcards, with a take from the BBC's Anthony Zurcher on each.\n\nWho will take on Trump in 2020? You can filter the list using the categories below. Those with ticks have confirmed they are running, while those with crosses have said they are not. 38 candidates in total Elizabeth Warren Wall St critic Elizabeth Warren has been a favourite of the progressive left since she emerged on the political scene to push for tougher regulation of the financial sector after the 2008 economic crash. During her time in the US Senate she became known for her hard-nosed interrogations of Wall Street executives and as an outspoken critic of income inequality. That loyal base may be enough to rise to the top of a fractured Democratic presidential field - but she will probably have to pry some supporters away from Bernie Sanders, who will be competing with her for progressive hearts and minds. Anthony's take: She\u2019s got financial chops and is building a formidable political operation, but professorial Massachusetts liberals are a tough sell to the rest of the country. Progressives will have to decide if they find her promise of economic reform more attractive than Bernie's revolutionary zeal. undefined\n\nJoe Biden Obama's VP Barack Obama picked Joe Biden to be his running-mate in 2008 because of his supposed folksy appeal to white working-class and middle-class voters - and that's exactly why he could be a formidable candidate in 2020. The former Delaware senator unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1998 and 2008 and declined to run in 2016 after the death of his son from brain cancer. His long voting record, which includes backing the Iraq War in 2002, would come under much scrutiny if he does enter the race. He has sharply criticised Donald Trump for \"trashing American values,\" but he's seen as a Democrat who could work with Republicans. Anthony's take:\n\nKamala Harris Rising star Kamala Harris is the kind of Democrat who could stick around and prevail in what is sure to be a gruelling nomination battle. She is from California, which is rich in both primary delegates and fundraising dollars. As a woman, and from an ethnic minority, she is well positioned to capitalise on her party's growing diversity. She has one of the most liberal voting records in the US Senate at a time when Democrats are leaning to the left, but she also has a background as a hard-nosed prosecutor. That background may end up a vulnerability as well, given that some progressives have criticised her for failing to support California criminal justice reform efforts and pointed to her prosecutorial record as being insufficiently sensitive to the rights of the accused. Anthony's take: She will be tested in the coming months, but looks and sounds like the kind of fresh-faced candidate that will appeal to a wide range of Democratic constituencies. If she can post decent showings in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, she'll be well-positioned to emerge from the pack when the primary voting moves south and west.\n\nBernie Sanders Mr Anti-Establishment The Vermont senator would be 79 on election day, but he's decided to make another run at the top prize. His long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 captured the hearts of American progressives, and he has been packing arenas with loyal supporters ever since. But former allies Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard are both also running this time round and could carve off some of his support. Anthony's take: Bernie Sanders is a victim of his own success. In 2016 he pulled the Democratic Party to the left, but it means he's not as unique a candidate in 2020. He has the advantages of name recognition, fund-raising and national campaign organisation, but his opponents won't avoid attacking him the way Hillary Clinton did three years ago. His day as a plucky underdog are over. undefined\n\nJulian Castro Ex-Obama ally It wasn't long ago that Julian Castro would have been considered a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. He was a well-regarded mayor of San Antonio, landed the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention and went on to a Cabinet position in the Obama administration. Now, however, he may not even end up the most popular Texan in the race, if Beto O'Rourke decides to run. And there are other politicians - ones currently holding elective office or with instant name recognition - who are generating more presidential buzz. Anthony's take: His resume is solid and his Hispanic heritage is helpful, but his charismatically challenged speaking style is never going to light up a crowd. He's the kind of politician who seems engineered in a laboratory for the vice-presidential spot.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand #MeToo ally Kirsten Gillibrand has long been positioning herself as one of the candidates most likely to capitalise on the #MeToo movement, and her pitch as someone who will \"fight as hard for other people's kids as she would for her own\" just might resonate. The New York senator's steady march to 2020 has already hit a few bumps, though. She angered some Democrats by quickly calling for Senator Al Franken's resignation after he faced sexual harassment allegations. And she alienated Clinton loyalists by criticising Bill Clinton's handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. These decisions could hurt her, even if she cites them as evidence that she matches her feminist rhetoric with action. Anthony's take:\n\nBeto O'Rourke Rock star Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke came up short in his 2018 bid to oust Texas Senator Ted Cruz but it's impressive he pushed him so close in a traditionally red state. And more importantly, he drew big crowds and raised money like a national powerhouse. He may not have Latin roots but Mr O'Rourke is fluent in Spanish and leans heavily on his \"Beto\" nickname - a common contraction of Roberto - which he picked up as a child in El Paso. His passionate delivery along with his good looks and background as a skateboarder and a punk rocker have endeared him to liberals across the country. Anthony's take:\n\nSherrod Brown Midwest populist The gravelly voiced senator from Ohio has been consistently re-elected in a populous Midwest state that has slipped away from Democrats in recent years. His pitch for the presidency would likely focus on winning back working-class voters in the Midwest and beyond with his own brand of economic populism. At a recent event, he bemoaned soaring corporate profits amid low-wage growth and attacked President Trump for using \"his phony populism to distract from the fact that he has used the White House to enrich billionaires like himself.\" Anthony's updated take: Sherrod Brown has a proven appeal to Midwestern voters, having won multiple Senate elections in trending-conservative Ohio. He would have been a popular choice for Democrats focused on winning back states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, whose loss cost Hillary Clinton the presidency. He opted to stay in the Senate rather than try for the White House, however, saying others would continue his fight for American workers. No doubt every candidate in the Democratic field will claim he\u2019s talking about them.\n\nAmy Klobuchar Folksy senator Amy Klobuchar may not be a household name, but the three-term Minnesota senator has shown the ability to win votes in the kind of Midwestern battleground state that Donald Trump appealed to in 2016. Another former prosecutor, Ms Klobuchar won praise for her cool competence in the heated confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. She has long prided herself in being able to \"disagree without being disagreeable\", giving her a reputation for being \"Minnesota nice\". But the initial buzz around her campaign has been dampened a bit by recent allegations that she has been abusive toward her staff. Anthony's take: She offers a steady, sensible political outlook that could attract the majority of Democratic voters who are more interested in electability than ideological purity. She will be in the thick of the fight for the support of moderate Democrats.\n\nCory Booker Gifted speaker Cory Booker is a prodigious fundraiser who knows how to work Wall Street donors. His background reflects the diversity of the modern Democratic Party and his time as mayor of blue-collar Newark gives him a grounding to the plight of the underprivileged. The New Jersey senator has an undisputed talent for public speaking, making him one of the more engaging candidates on the stump. Many on the left don't trust him, however. They view his big-money ties as a liability and haven't forgotten his 2012 defence of Republican Mitt Romney's venture-capital background during that year's presidential campaign. Anthony's take: Mr Booker will be pressed to convince Democrats he's the one to take them to the promised land. He has some of that Obama 2008 hope-and-change magic, but his silver tongue will get quite a workout.\n\nStacey Abrams Southern progressive She would have become the first black female governor in US history if she had prevailed in her Georgia race last year. She lost by fewer than 55,000 votes to Republican Brian Kemp, who at the time was Georgia's secretary of state, and initally refused to concede victory after allegations of voter suppression. The buzz her candidacy generated among grass-roots Democrats is still present and she was tapped to deliver the Democratic response to Donald Trump's 2019 State of the Union Address. Anthony's take: She'd be a good candidate for any office, but she may have her eyes on the Senate now, not the presidency. And if she mounts a winning race there, she could help the Democratic nominee be competitive in Georgia, as well. undefined\n\nBill De Blasio Progressive mayor Bill De Blasio became a progressive darling when he won the New York mayor\u2019s office in 2013 while decrying the city\u2019s income inequality. Since then, he\u2019s enacted universal pre-kindergarten and policing reform but struggled to deal with the city's housing crisis. Anthony's take: He appears eager to tout his accomplishments on a national stage but his appeal is limited.\n\nHoward Schultz Starbucks tycoon Howard Schultz is the recently retired head of coffeehouse giant Starbucks with a net worth of more than $2.5bn. He has talked up fiscal restraint and government reform in public appearances. He intially explored running as a Democrat, but now he seems more interested in an independent bid, saying the party had \"shifted so far to the left\". Anthony's take: A self-proclaimed \"centrist\" running on a deficit-reduction platform might end up syphoning as many Republican moderates away from Trump as liberals or independents away from the Democratic nominee. That hasn't stopped those on the left from vigorously objecting to his proposed candidacy, however.\n\nHillary Clinton You know who After 2016, Hillary Clinton needs no introduction. She won more votes than Donald Trump but lost the election in spectacular fashion. Since then, she's continued to attack Mr Trump and his administration, particularly over its policy of family separation on the US-Mexico border.\n\nAndrew Gillum Future star The former-mayor of Tallahassee came within a fraction of a percentage of winning the governorship of key presidential swing-state Florida \u2013 closer than any Democrat has in 20 years. After the loss, the young and charismatic candidate said he still planned to remain on the front line fighting for a clean environment and better wages for teachers. On 20 March, he shed light on what that meant \u2013 spearheading a multi-million dollar effort to boost Democratic voter registration in his home state ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Anthony's updated take:\n\nPete Buttigieg Impressive millennial Pete Buttigieg isn't the only millennial in the 2020 race but he is positioning himself as a voice for the young. The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a military veteran and the only openly gay presidential hopeful. He\u2019s proven he can win locally in a conservative state and mounted a surprisingly strong bid for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017. Anthony's take: The march of time ensures millennials will run things someday. A Buttigieg presidency is a long shot for 2020, but his candidacy is a sign of things to come.\n\nOprah Winfrey Yes, that Oprah Oprah is a household name in the US, having built up a huge following during her long-running talk show by tackling issues people could relate to. She has also produced and acted in movies, published her own magazine, and set up her own cable channel - all of which has helped her to become one of the world's richest people. The TV star turned a lot of heads when she made a very political speech at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards, touching on themes of race, gender, power and the #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment. Anthony's take:\n\nTulsi Gabbard Iraq veteran Tulsi Gabbard, born in American Samoa and of Polynesian descent, is a difficult candidate to characterise. Most of the Hawaii congresswoman's views fit firmly in the progressive camp and she was an early and outspoken supporter of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. The Iraq War veteran has drawn criticism, however, for meeting with Bashar al-Assad in January 2017 - after the Syrian president had been accused of repeatedly using poison gas on civilian populations. The daughter of a socially conservative politician and activist, Ms Gabbard may also draw the ire of Democratic voters for her past criticism of \"homosexual extremists\" and opposition to abortion rights and gay marriage.\n\nMitch Landrieu Ex-New Orleans mayor The former mayor of New Orleans is a member of a prominent Louisiana political family. He gained national recognition in 2017 after the leading the charge to take down Confederate war statues in his city. After leaving office, he wrote a book called \"In the Shadow of Statues\" in which he discussed the controversy and his \"personal journey on race\". Anthony's take:\n\nEric Holder Ambitious ex-AG Eric Holder was Barack Obama\u2019s first attorney general \u2013 and the first black attorney general in US history. He is viewed as a champion of criminal justice reform by those on the left, but he became the poster boy for Democratic obstruction and overreach for his conservative critics. A corporate lawyer and veteran of the Justice Department, he\u2019s never run for elected office. Anthony\u2019s updated take:\n\nAndrew Yang Tech entrepreneur Yang is a technology entrepreneur who should be well prepared seeing as he announced he was running for president back in November 2017. He graduated from Columbia Law School and spent more than a decade working on several start-up companies before being appointed Ambassador of Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 by the Obama administration. He\u2019s proposing that the US government pay a $1,000-a-month \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d to all Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 as a form of universal basic income to cushion against fewer jobs due to increased automation. Anthony's take:\n\nJohn Kerry Veteran diplomat John Kerry was the Democratic nominee in 2004 and lost a close race against George W Bush. After studying at Yale, he enlisted in the US Navy and served in the Vietnam War. He was honoured with a Silver Star, Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. He was a Massachusetts senator from 1985 until 2013, when Barack Obama appointed him secretary of state. Anthony's take:\n\nTim Ryan Midwest moderate Tim Ryan is a congressman from working-class eastern Ohio, where he touts trade and jobs as his big issues, but he\u2019s moved to the left on social issues lately. Anthony's take: He launched a challenge to Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016, which has made him some powerful enemies. Democratic voters who want a candidate with mid-western blue-collar appeal, however, might not care. A bigger threat for Ryan is from Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown. undefined undefined undefined undefined\n\nMarianne Williamson Spiritual counsellor Marianne Williamson is a best-selling author, charity organiser and spiritual adviser who counts Oprah Winfrey as her most famous follower. Her bid to become president isn't her first foray into politics - she tried and failed to win California\u2019s 33rd congressional district back in 2014. She spent nearly $2m and finished fourth. Anthony's take:\n\nDwayne Johnson The, er, Rock Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson announced his presidential campaign while hosting Saturday Night Live in 2017. He even brought on Tom Hanks to ask him to be his running mate. But all was not what it seemed and the former WWE star later admitted that he was \"only joking\". The actor did, however, say that \"Americans deserve strong capable leaders who care about this country and its people\".\n\nTim Kaine The stepdad Tim Kaine was nicknamed \u201cAmerica\u2019s stepdad\u201d after his relatively bland but good-natured campaign as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. The Virginia senator, who is fluent in Spanish, cruised to re-election this year. Anthony's take: A friendly but somewhat bland one-time loser to team Trump may not be what Democrats are looking for in 2020. undefined\n\nMark Cuban The Left's Trump A business tycoon, sports-team owner and reality television show host with a penchant for producing outrageous quotes. Born and raised in a working class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Mr Cuban became a millionaire at 32 and a billionaire at 41. His main focus these days is his sometimes controversial ownership of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. He also has numerous other business commitments and investments, and a high-profile role as one of the investors on the Shark Tank TV show, the US version of the UK's Dragons' Den.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper Low-key moderate He has an amusing last name, but John Hickenlooper's popularity as the outgoing governor of swing-state Colorado is no joke. One of his more notable accomplishments in Colorado was tightening gun laws after the Aurora movie theatre shooting in 2012. Anthony's take: He\u2019s a business-first moderate who styles his low-key response as the \u201cantidote to Trump\u201d. Although he's a pro-business moderate, he has a list of progressive state-level accomplishments on healthcare, gay rights and the environment that he can tout on the stump. undefined\n\nTerry McAuliffe Pal of the Clintons Terry McAuliffe started his career as a behind-the-scenes political money man but parlayed that into a successful term as governor of Virginia. He ran campaigns for both Clintons and became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee so he knows how the power structures of the party work. Anthony's take: Due to the Ralph Northam blackface scandal, having experience as governor of Virginia isn't quite as big of a selling point as it used to be. McAuliffe's close ties to the Clintons will ensure he can raise plenty of cash, but his ties to the somewhat tarnished Democratic dynasty could be more of a hindrance than a help.\n\nJay Inslee Climate campaigner As governor of Washington, Inslee has taken a lead role in \u201cthe resistance\u201d to the Trump administration on the state level, including pushing a lawsuit that blocked the president\u2019s first travel ban. A former member of Congress, he\u2019s made climate change and the environment a top issue. Anthony's take: There once was a time when an experienced governor with a proven record of executive leadership would have a leg up in a presidential nominating contest. Senators, bogged down by countless votes and the necessities of legislative compromise, were at a disadvantage. Jay Inslee is a steady campaigner with a robust resume, but he might find it difficult to connect with the Democratic Party's increasingly diverse base. undefined\n\nJeff Merkley Oregon senator Merkley was the only senator to support Bernie Sanders in 2016 and is toward the left end of the 2020 presidential field. In June he made headlines by travelling to the US-Mexico border to denounce Mr Trump\u2019s policy of separating the families of undocumented migrants detained at the border. Anthony's updated take: If Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders had pulled each other down in a battle to claim the progressive candidate mantle, perhaps Jeff Merkley could have snuck through unscathed as an appealing alternative. Perhaps fearing he would get lost in the shuffle, he took his name out of contention. undefined\n\nMark Warner Economic moderate A former Virginia governor and, like Tim Kaine, a senator. He made a fortune as a telecommunications executive and has gained a national spotlight recently as the ranking Democrat on the Senate committee investigating Russian election meddling. Anthony's take: They say every senator sees a future president when looking in the mirror each morning, and Warner is no different. He has an influential perch on the Intelligence Committee, however, and may have plenty to keep him busy when the Robert Mueller investigation (eventually) concludes. undefined undefined\n\nSteve Bullock Little-known governor Steve Bullock is making a pitch as a moderate who can appeal to rural voters. The governor of Montana has been talking up campaign finance reform and net neutrality \u2013 two issues that have a passionate following on the left. Anthony's take: He has an uphill fight as a little-known governor from a distant state. undefined\n\nMichael Bennet Soft-spoken moderate A moderate senator from the trending-Democratic state of Colorado, Michael Bennet has been putting out presidential feelers. Anthony's take: At some point it will be easier to list the Democratic senators who aren\u2019t considering a 2020 run, rather than those who are. undefined undefined\n\nJohn Delaney Ex-tech entrepreneur John Delaney was officially the first entrant into the 2020 Democratic presidential field when the Maryland congressman announced his candidacy in July 2017. The former tech entrepreneur has a platform that focuses on jobs, education and infrastructure and a return to bipartisan co-operation. Anthony's take: Mr Delaney's call for a return to bipartisan co-operation is going to be a tough sell in today's sharply divided political environment. The three-term Maryland congressman has logged the hours in Iowa, which hosts the first nominating contest. He's got a chance if accumulated face time translates into votes. (It doesn't.) undefined\n\nEric Swalwell California congressman Eric Swalwell has been an outspoken critic of the president\u2019s and a fixture on cable news shows. He's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and was previously on the Homeland Security Committee, so has travelled to countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan. The California congressman has two children and brought his baby along to Congress for the swearing-in ceremony in January. Anthony's take: He could position himself among the \u201cyouth\u201d candidates in a field that will probably be dominated by greying front-runners. And Donald Trump's rise is evidence of the fact that a robust television presence can translate into voter support.\n\nJason Kander Army veteran The US Army veteran and former Missouri secretary of state generated presidential buzz after a surprisingly strong but ultimately unsuccessful 2016 Senate race in his conservative home state. He entered the race for Kansas City mayor in 2018, only to drop out because of PTSD issues arising from his Afghanistan War service. Anthony's take: Jason Kander was the 2016 version of Beto O'Rourke - a charismatic young Senate hopeful who came up just short in an effort to unseat a red-state Republican incumbent. Without a government office, even the most talented young politicians have a short shelf life, however. Recapturing that 2016 magic would be a tall order. undefined undefined\n\nSeth Moulton Ex-Marine Seth Moulton recently made headlines for mounting a futile effort to derail Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Massachusetts congressman served four tours in Iraq with the Marines before getting a master's degree in business at Harvard. Anthony's take: He may have presidential aspirations, but if you come at the queen you had best succeed. The next two years might be better spent mending fences in Congress, instead of making friends in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Last year, 7,318 people were referred to the programme.\n\nPrevent has different strands. The Channel scheme is for individuals who cause such concern that they need concerted help to deradicalise.\n\nAnother part is the Desistance and Disengagement programme, aimed at rehabilitating people already convicted of terror offences or returning from conflict zones. Last June, the government announced it was planning to double investment in that strand.\n\nThe government says it aims to tackle a person's ideology, as well as the personal issues which can drive radicalisation - for example around self-esteem and identity.\n\nIt can include one-to-one mentoring, support to get a job or education and psychological help.\n\nDr Sarah Marsden, a lecturer in radicalisation at Lancaster University, said the type of mentoring offered depends on the individual.\n\nSessions can be weekly or monthly and can include trained specialists - such as youth workers or imams - who may start by building up trust, she said.\n\nAnd the conversations depend on the person's original reasons for getting involved in violent extremism.\n\n\"In some cases there will be a mentor just working on social issues,\" she said. \"In others they will be specifically talking about ideology - whether it's far-right or Islamist.\n\n\"These will be more focused on readings of texts or readings of ideological positions, and discussing them to introduce the individual to alternative ways of interpreting texts and help them to try and understand it's not the only version.\"\n\nHow does it work?\n\nDr Marsden, who has spent time with organisations that work with extremists, said there is not enough evidence to say which particular techniques work best.\n\nBut her research suggested one of the most useful methods was finding out why someone was drawn to violent extremism, and then \"redirecting these motivations\" to create a more positive future.\n\n\"Ultimately, change has to come from within,\" she said, \"You have to be motivated to do that, otherwise it's just lip service.\n\n\"Motivation can come from the individual by what they have seen or experienced and they do not want to go through it again.\n\n\"Or they can be motivated because other people work with them to instil that motivation.\"\n\nImage copyright Met Police Image caption Parsons Green bomber Ahmed Hassan had been enrolled in Prevent, but still went on to carry out his attack\n\nHanif Qadir, a former adviser to the government and who has worked with extremists in deradicalisation programmes, said Ms Begum was a \"spot on candidate\" for such a programme.\n\nHe himself was radicalised in 2002 and travelled to Afghanistan to join al-Qaeda, but quickly returned when he saw young children being recruited as suicide bombers.\n\nHe said Ms Begum's language in interviews - for example talking in the past tense about how she understood IS's ideology - was a \"chink in her armour\" which could be a starting point for discussions.\n\nHow can you tell if deradicalisation has worked?\n\nDeradicalisation is not an exact science and mistakes can be made, for example with the 2017 Parsons Green bomber who had been enrolled in the Prevent programme.\n\nIt's a \"really complex\" task determining whether someone who claims they've changed their extremist views actually has, said Dr Marsden.\n\n\"How do you actually know that somebody isn't just saying that to make their lives a bit easier?\"\n\nBut she said \"people do change their minds\" and criminal justice professionals \"are very familiar with this\" conundrum.\n\nJudgements about the individual's credibility are made, as well as risk assessments by a range of professionals.\n\n\"If [the extremist] doesn't believe in the ideas any more, you can take it as a reduction of risk but it's not a guarantee. Equally, having very strong political opinions doesn't mean they will go out and commit a crime.\"\n\nNikita Malik, who heads up the Centre on Radicalisation and Terrorism at the Henry Jackson Society, has carried out research into women who have joined IS and then returned home with their children.\n\nShe said: \"Unfortunately, even the deradicalisation programme we have for returnees - which is a Desistance and Disengagement programme - incentivises people in it to lie because the notes are shared with the judges who then determine how often they can see their child.\"\n\nHanif Qadir, who is CEO of the Active Change Foundation, recalls working with one young man who had been convicted of terror offences.\n\nTo test his progress, he asked the man to speak about his experiences to a crowd of other young people.\n\n\"When he started to open up [about his extremism] he got very, very emotional. A couple of young men approached him after the talk and said 'this is exactly what we're feeling.'\n\n\"He then mentioned them to me. That was a measure of success as he could have not told me about these guys.\""}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-47321411", "text": "Image copyright Jorge Gonzalez / Lindsay Zanno Image caption Artwork: Tyrannosaurs were generally small early on in their evolution\n\nA newly discovered relative of Tyrannosaurus rex stood just over a metre tall at the hip, a study shows.\n\nThe diminutive tyrannosaur reveals crucial new information about how T. rex established itself as a dominant carnivore in North America.\n\nEarly in their evolution, tyrannosaurs were small, but at some stage, the hulking T. rex along with others emerged as apex predators.\n\nThe new fossil helps fill a 70-million-year gap in the fossil record.\n\nDiscovered in Emery County, Utah, the animal lived about 96 million years ago, during the later part of the Cretaceous Period.\n\nTyrannosaurs, or \"tyrant lizards\" - the group to which this specimen and T. rex belong - ruled the predatory roost on land during the last 15 million years before the Chicxulub asteroid slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula 66 million years ago. T. rex could reach more than 3.5m tall as measured at the hip.\n\nBut, as co-author Lindsay Zanno, from North Carolina State University, explained, it wasn't always this way: \"Early in their evolution, tyrannosaurs hunted in the shadows of archaic lineages such as allosaurs that were already established at the top of the food chain,\" she said.\n\nOur understanding of the evolutionary events leading up to the appearance of giant tyrannosaurs has been limited by the lack of complete fossils in North America.\n\nSmall-ish, primitive tyrannosaurs have been found in North America dating from the Jurassic Period (around 150 million years ago). By around 81 million years ago, North American tyrannosaurs had become enormous beasts. But the fossil record in between these two time periods is patchy.\n\nThe lower leg bones of the new species, Moros intrepidus, were discovered in the same area where Dr Zanno and her team had previously found Siats meekerorum, a giant meat-eating dinosaur belonging to a group known as the carcharodontosaurs.

It was seven years old when it died and was almost fully grown.\n\nAlthough it was comparatively lightweight, it was probably very fast on its feet. \"These adaptations, together with advanced sensory capabilities, are the mark of a formidable predator. It could easily have run down prey, while avoiding confrontation with the top predators of the day,\" said Dr Zanno.\n\n\"Although the earliest Cretaceous tyrannosaurs were small, their predatory specialisations meant that they were primed to take advantage of new opportunities when warming temperatures, rising sea-level and shrinking ranges restructured ecosystems at the beginning of the Late Cretaceous.\n\n\"We now know it took them less than 15 million years to rise to power.\"\n\nThe scientific paper, published in the journal Communications Biology, makes the case that these environmental changes may have led to the decline of the allosaurs - the apex predators that reigned until the emergence of big tyrannosaurs.\n\nAn analysis of Moros' place on the family tree of tyrannosaurs appears to suggest that the group may have migrated to North America from Asia.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"source": "bbc", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_beach_nobody_can_touch", "text": "In 2018 local tourism operators and officials on Phi Phi island realised the numbers were unsustainable.\n\nMaya Bay lies within a national park, and the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation held a crisis meeting.\n\nDespite concern from tourism businesses in the area, authorities successfully argued it should be shut down.\n\nThey argued that coral reefs were severely damaged and the ecosystem desperately needed time to recover.\n\nOn 1 June authorities imposed a demarcation line that boats could come up to but could not cross, and began patrolling the area so nobody could enter the bay precinct.\n\nDr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine scientist from Kasetsart University who has studied Maya Bay and the area for 40 years, was hired by the ministry to survey the environmental damage and lead the rehabilitation.\n\n\"Back in 1998-1999, the damaged coral totalled about 30%, but now 90% of what\u2019s there is damaged.\"\n\nCoral reefs are fragile and very sensitive to water quality.

I have a stopwatch,\" he said.\n\n\"Why waste precious time thanking your mom when you could be taking her for the ride of her life on a brand-new jet-ski?\"\n\nAnd he wasn't kidding.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dame Helen Mirren was tasked with presenting the jet-ski to the shortest speech winner\n\nThe eventual winner was Mark Bridges, who went home with the prize for best costume design for Phantom Thread.\n\nBut his 30-second speech meant he was also the recipient of a jet ski worth $18,000 (\u00a313,800) - which was presented to him by Dame Helen Mirren.\n\n\"I have the philosophy that nobody wants to hear the costume designer yammer on about who to thank,\" Bridges tells BBC News ahead of this year's Oscars.\n\n\"I want to make it short and sweet.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDespite his speech policy, Bridges says his jet ski win was accidental rather than deliberate - as his speech was shorter even than he had intended.\n\n\"Basically, I forgot one sentence I was going to say, which was thanking [director] Paul Thomas Anderson more for working with me all these years,\" he explains.\n\n\"So I guess that's why it ended up being the shortest speech, because I skipped that sentence... so winning [the jet ski] actually was coincidence.\"\n\nMost other winners at last year's ceremony were unswayed by the prospect of prizes and delivered the long speeches they had planned.\n\n\"Obviously I'm not going to win the ski,\" best actor winner Gary Oldman joked at the end of his three-minute speech.\n\nBest supporting actor winner Sam Rockwell was more ambitious, commenting when he arrived on stage: \"Run that clock, Jimmy, I want to get that ski-jet or whatever that was.\"\n\n(Obviously he was unsuccessful too.)\n\nBut the whole idea was generally praised by critics for brightening up the ceremony.\n\n\"As 'Oscars too long' riffs go, the jet-ski business was actually brilliant,\" wrote Tasha Robinson in The Verge.\n\nDave Fawbert of Short List described it as \"the funniest part of the Oscars\", praising Kimmel for \"Injecting a little levity into proceedings\".\n\nSo, the big question, of course, is whether Bridges has now become a regular jet ski user.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"No, there were a couple of reasons why I was not going to use that jet ski,\" he explains.\n\n\"Someone had asked me shortly after I won it whether I'd had any experience on a jet ski. And all I could reply was 'none good'.\n\n\"And also it's interesting here in America when you win something, then you're liable for taxes on it, so it was quite expensive jet-ski, so it was quite a bit of money to pay for taxes for it.\n\n\"So I thought I'd turn lemons into lemonade, so to speak, and I donated it to the Motion Picture & Television Fund (MPTF). That does a lot of charitable work for people in the industry.\"\n\nBridges explains the MPTF has a senior citizens home and a health facility, adding it's an organisation he'd wanted to contribute to for a while.\n\nSpeech advice\n\n\"And I thought they could probably auction it and make some money, and I got a lovely phonecall from [Foundation board chairman] Jeffrey Katzenberg thanking me, and I do think it was a win-win situation, I think they were able to get some influx of donations from it.\"\n\nThis actually wasn't the first time the Academy had offered a prize for the shortest speech.\n\nIn 2001, it was announced at the Oscar nominees luncheon that the winner who delivered the shortest speech would win a flatscreen TV.\n\nThat year, it ended up going to Dutch animator Michael Dudok de Wit, who won for his animated short Father and Daughter.\n\nWith his 18-second speech, De Wit won the prize despite not even knowing it was on offer, as he had missed the luncheon.\n\nNot wanting to ship it home to the Netherlands, he instead donated it to an LA-based residential facility for abused children.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Dudok de Wit delivered an 18-second acceptance speech after winning best animated short film in 2001\n\nBut Bridges took away more than the jet-ski. As part of the prize, he also won a vacation to Lake Havasu, Arizona.\n\nThe very mention of the holiday at the Oscars resulted in a tourism boost for the city.\n\nBut, as a result of work commitments immediately after the Oscars, Bridges says he hasn't yet had the time to take that holiday.\n\n\"No, I still have the gift certificate in my drawer some place,\" he laughs.\n\n\"Although I got a request to go and talk to school children there about water safety - I'm not kidding you.\n\n\"And I was like 'I'm sorry I won't be able to partake in that at all!' It was really interesting because there was a moment where winning the jet ski was overshadowing me getting my Oscar.\n\n\"I'm all for a gag and everything, it was a fun moment, but that was [too far]!\"\n\nImage copyright Universal Image caption Bridges was the costume designer on Phantom Thread, which starred Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps\n\nLast year's Oscar win for costume design was the second for Bridges, who also took home the same prize in 2012 for his work on The Artist.\n\nAnd he could well find himself nominated again next year. His next project to hit the big screen will be Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the DC Comics character, which is released later this year.\n\nBridges recalls advice the Academy gave to all nominees back in 2012 in order to keep their speeches succinct - something he clearly paid attention to.\n\n\"The Academy used to give you a very informative DVD to give you some suggestions about your speech and how to make it personal and succinct. So I kind of go by the suggestions that they gave.\n\n\"It's already a very long show, and they also have a thank you camera backstage. After you are on the main stage you go backstage and then you're able to thank people too.\n\n\"So rather than bog down the show, I could go backstage and thank my mom and my family and things like that. So nobody gets missed, but a billion people don't need to listen to you thank your mom for tucking you in at night.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
