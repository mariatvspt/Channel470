He told those gathered in court that he has suffered two strokes since the election and is \u201cstruggling\u201d to get through the hearing.\n\nIn his sworn testimony, Harris said that he was assured by political operative \u2013 and convicted felon \u2013 Leslie McCrae Dowless that campaign workers would never collect absentee ballots, despite concerns from Harris\u2019 son, John, that Dowless was illegally collecting and turning in ballots from voters.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA STARTS HEARING ON BALLOT FRAUD ALLEGATIONS IN CONESTED HOUSE RACE\n\n\u201cI shared with him (John Harris) again, based on what I was hearing, that I didn\u2019t sense that,\u201d Harris said, according to the Charlotte Observer.\n\n\u201cMcCrae had been so clear I didn\u2019t think it was necessary,\u201d Harris added. \u201cI didn\u2019t go back any further...I did have a comfort level at that point.\"\n\nOne of the methods participants said Dowless used was to hire workers to collect absentee ballots from voters who received them, and then turn them over to him, according to an elections board investigation.\n\nState election law prohibits anyone other than a guardian or close family member from handling mail-in ballots. Harris' team said in a legal briefing submitted to the elections board last week the board should certify him the winner -- no matter what Dowless did for the campaign.\n\nHarris\u2019 comments came a day after his son took the stand in emotional testimony that left his father in tears.\n\n\"I raised red flags at the time the decision was made to hire Mr. Dowless,\" John Harris said in his testimony on Wednesday.\n\n\"I love my dad, and I love my mom. I certainly have no vendetta against them, no family scores to settle,\" he said. \"I think that they made mistakes in this process and they certainly did things differently than I would have done them.\"\n\nHarris\u2019 son\u2019s testimony bucked the politician\u2019s previous claims that he had no knowledge of fraudulent election activity. On Thursday, the elder Harris admitted that his son had warned him about his concerns over Dowless.\n\n\u201cMy son was a bit prophetic in his statement that day,\u201d Harris said.\n\nAt stake in the hearings is the seat for North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, which includes Charlotte. The State Board of Elections has not certified unofficial results that showed Harris narrowly beating McCready by 905 votes. The state has twice refused to declare Harris the winner, after hearing reports of irregularities just before the election in rural Bladen County, where Dowless lives.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe North Carolina Democratic Party cheered the move to hold another election, saying Harris' campaign \"funded and directed an elaborate, illegal scheme to steal an election.\"\n\n\"North Carolina Republicans, following Mark Harris\u2019 lead, repeatedly lied to the people of the Ninth district, silenced their voices, and undermined our entire state\u2019s faith in our democracy,\" NCDP Chairman Wayne Goodwin said in a statement. \"This saga could only have ended in a new election, and we look forward to repairing the harm dealt by Republicans and giving the people of the Ninth district the representative they deserve.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/peter-tork-of-the-monkees-dead-at-77-report-says", "text": "Peter Tork, keyboardist and bass guitarist of \u201860s pop group The Monkees, has died Thursday.

We send blessings and thoughts of comfort to you all, with much gratitude.\u201d\n\nTork was born Peter Halsten Thorkelson in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 13, 1942. His mother was a homemaker, and his father \u2013 an Army officer who served in the military government in Berlin after World War II \u2013 was an economics professor.\n\nReps for Micky Dolenz and Michael Nesmith, remaining members of The Monkees, did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment. Davy Jones passed away in 2012 at age 66.\n\n\u201cThe Monkees\u201d was initially a made-for-TV-band that became a worldwide phenomenon after its two-year run (1966-1968). The NBC series told the hilarious misadventures of a struggling rock band, described as a \u201cmanufactured version of the Beatles,\u201d where Tork was its lovable Ringo. The series was created by producers Bob Radelson and Bert Schneider to mimic the success of \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and \u201cHelp!\u201d the musical comedies about the Beatles by director Richard Lester, according to The Washington Post.\n\nDAVY JONES DEAD AT 66\n\nAs part of the teeny-bopper sensation, Tork performed as the self-described \u201cdummy\u201d of the group and drew inspiration for his persona from his time working as a folk musician in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village. But off-screen, Tork embraced the Summer of Love movement and proudly wore \u201clove beads\u201d and declared that \u201cnonverbal, extrasensory communication is at hand\u201d and that \u201cdogmatism is leaving the scene.\u201d\n\nTork, who was The Monkees\u2019 oldest member at age 24 in 1966, also sung lead vocals on tracks, such as \u201cYour Auntie Grizelda\u201d and \u201cLong Title: Do I have to Do This All Over Again,\u201d which he wrote for the band\u2019s 1968 psychedelic film \u201cHead.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cThe Monkees\u201d ran for only two seasons, it won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy and resulted in massive record sales, highly sought-after merchandising and world tours known as Monkeemania. According to one report by The Washington Post, The Monkees sold 35 million albums in 1967 \u2014 \u201ctwice as many as the Beatles and Rolling Stones combined.\u201d\n\nThe Monkees also played to sold-out stadium crowds and were backed by opening acts, such as guitarist Jimi Hendrix during one brief moment. However, Tork reportedly clashed with his bandmates as his musical ambitions grew. He left the group soon after the release of \u201cHead.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Washington Post noted that for much of the 1970s, Tork struggled on his own as an artist. While he formed a band called Release, it proved to be unsuccessful. He was also imprisoned for several months in 1972 after being caught with \u201c$3 worth of hashish in my pocket.\u201d He also worked as a high school teacher and a \u201csinging waiter.\u201d Tork previously told UK\u2019s Daily Mail he also struggled with alcoholism before getting clean in the early 1980s.\n\nWith the help of reruns and album reissues, a growing interest in the Monkees ultimately compelled Tork to embrace the music group. He would go on to join them for major reunion tours about once each decade, beginning in the mid-\u201880s. He also performed as a solo artist. His 1994 album \u201cStranger Things Have Happened\u201d was well-received.\n\n\u201cThis is not a band,\u201d Tork told Britain\u2019s Telegraph in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s an entertainment operation whose function is Monkee music.

The obscure \u201cEmpire\u201d actor \u2013 who is black and gay \u2013 claimed he had been assaulted in Chicago by two men who yelled \u201cThis is MAGA country\" and shouted anti-black and anti-gay epithets.\n\nIt was exactly the story liberal journalists, actors and politicians craved. It demonized people wearing the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats favored by President Trump\u2019s supporters. The supposedly pro-Trump \u201cattackers\u201d were also portrayed as racists who brought a noose to their assault and hated gays.\n\nThe story had everything but skepticism.\n\nThe Smollett case landed right at the intersection of pop culture, politics, racism and fame. It became a weapon for the left to wield against the evil, MAGA-hat wearing villains the media so despised.\n\nBut many on the right saw it as just another in a long line of hate crime claims that would likely fall apart. Few listened.\n\nThe very next day, the Washington Post ran a story headlined: \u201cThe Jussie Smollett attack highlights the hate black gay Americans face.\u201d It was one of the first of almost countless think pieces, many decrying the horrible racism of \u201cthe Trump administration with their dog whistle politics.\u201d\n\nThe Smollett case was a news story, covered by news reporters. But it was also a culture story covered by people who don\u2019t know how to cover crime stories. The whole concept of an \u201calleged\u201d crime went out the window.\n\nThe incident went viral with posts coming not just 24-7, but 60-60-24-7. Twitter was flooded with comments supporting Smollett and slamming racist conservatives. The comments from pundits, actors and journalists became almost indistinguishable.\n\nNew York Post staff writer Zachary Kussin got to the heart of the matter, reportedly tweeting, \u201cI also hate when cops investigate this kind of blatant s---- as a \u2018possible hate crime.\u2019 This is obviously a hate crime.\u201d\n\nCNN political analyst April Ryan said much the same, declaring: \u201cThis attack on @JussieSmollett is a hate crime and should be treated as such!\u201d\n\nMillions have now viewed how actress Ellen Page used the incident to rant against Vice President Mike Pence opposing gay weddings like her own. Page complained about Pence during her interview on Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d and argued that \u201cpeople are going to be beaten in the street\u201d because of anti-LGBT attitudes.\n\nThere were so many over-the-top takes that Mediaite\u2019s Caleb Howe amassed a list of about three dozen overboard comments, most from the media. Yet journalists denied they had done anything wrong.\n\nCNN\u2019s Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter pointed his finger for problems as being \u201cmostly in the celebrity press and among activists and among Twitter people.\u201d He was defensive of the rest of the media. \u201cI think it was a really careful reporting by news organizations,\u201d he said at the beginning of the week.\n\nAs the Smollett claims collapsed, the press tried to find new anti-media outrages. The New York Times ran a piece Wednesday about how \u201cTrump Attacks The Times, in a Week of Unease for the American Press,\u201d yet it somehow left out the Smollett disaster. It only mentioned the Covington fiasco to complain about the president\u2019s \u201canti-newspaper animus.\u201d\n\nNow Smollett has been arrested and journalists still haven\u2019t learned a thing. They whine that Trump and his supporters are anti-First Amendment, even though that same amendment also protects Trump\u2019s speech along with their own.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd too few journalists want to admit they are the problem, or that hype and clicks go hand-in-hand with hatred and division.

In a rational world, then, a citizen who made war against the United States would be stripped of citizenship.\n\nAlas, that is not the law. As I related in the Post column, Supreme Court precedent holds that natural-born citizens may not have their citizenship revoked without their consent.

Here\u2019s a litany of the things she\u2019s been saying recently:\n\n\u201cThis country was founded on some basic moral principles. That we have a moral compass as a nation, our morality as a country is literally on a knife's edge. \u2026 For me it's really a moral question. \u2026 For me it's very much a moral question. \u2026 I've been called to fight as hard as I possibly can to restore that moral integrity and that moral decency.\u201d\n\n\"Moral integrity, moral decency.\" It would be interesting to know if Gillibrand gave that lecture to her old friend, Harvey Weinstein, or to her pal, disgraced New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

She can empathize with another pampered rich person fighting for victimhood status. When the next hate-hoax comes along, Gillibrand will probably tweet support of that, too. She can't resist a fad.\n\nWhatever the political opportunities are, she is there, too, in lockstep.\n\nGillibrand once supported a balanced budget amendment, now, she backs the Green New Deal. She once bragged about keeping two guns under her bed, she had an A-rating from the NRA, now she wants to ban rifles. She says the NRA is not simply wrong, but evil. Here\u2019s what she said, \u201cThe NRA has a choke hold on Congress. The NRA is concerned only with gun sales. It is literally all about money. It is all about greed. It has nothing to do with the Second Amendment. It is the power of money. It is the power of communications. It's the fear they instill in members and it's wrong. It's morally wrong.\u201d\n\nThere it is again, \"it's morally wrong.\" The beauty of declaring something morally wrong, rather than just misguided or ineffective, is that you can't really argue with a moral absolute. You can only obey a moral absolute, and that's of course, the point of laying it down.\n\nAs a member of Congress not so long ago, Gillibrand said she believed in borders. She promised to crack down on sanctuary cities. She opposed awarding driver's licenses to illegal aliens. That was then. Now, she wants to abolish ICE. Here\u2019s what she told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo:\n\n\u201cI don't think I.C.E. today, is working as intended.\n\nChris Cuomo, anchor, CNN: Well, you think you should get rid of the agency?\n\n\u201cI believe that it has become a deportation force, and I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues, and I think you should reimagine ICE and that's why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it, and build something that actually works.\u201d\n\nYou could see her trying to remember the talking points, \"Don't get confused. Reimagine ICE.\" But she got a little over her skis. It turned out that when she said that, banning ICE wasn't very popular even among Democratic voters. So Gillibrand lurched back and said she didn't really want to get rid of ICE, when, as you saw in the interview with CNN, she proposed exactly that.\n\nBut now, just a few months later, she is lurching back again, abolishing ICE. That qualifies as centrism in the Democratic Party right now. So Gillibrand needs something more radical than that. She wants to be considered the progressive candidate, and this week, she found it.\n\nGillibrand proclaimed that border security is immoral because it impedes the movement of indigenous peoples into our country, which apparently is really their country. Here\u2019s this exchange:\n\nInterviewer: On immigration, I mean, there is a crisis going on at the border right now.\n\nGillibrand: There is. It's inhumane. We need to have proper asylum and this president doesn't believe in asylum. He is afraid of immigrants. He is afraid of refugees.\n\nInterviewer: And I just want to note that a lot of these people are indigenous to this land and that border is cutting them off.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGillibrand: I know. That's why the wall is so absurd and hurtful.\n\nJust who are these indigenous people? Who knows, as long as they're female and intersectional, Kirsten Gillibrand believes they are our future.\n\nAdapted from Tucker Carlson\u2019s monologue on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d on February 20, 2019."}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/laura-ingraham-victimhood-u-our-kids-deserve-better-than-that-what-theyre-being-fed-on-college-campuses", "text": "As we see polls showing young people slouching towards socialism, it got me thinking. Why is this happening? Why would they embrace a system that has proven itself such a colossal failure? Think about it. A contraction of liberty. A scarcity of goods. Scarce medicine.

Because the key to understanding this fanatical fad is that when you're a socialist, facts are kind of irrelevant. Now why? Well, they're irrelevant because the ends, in a supposedly more equal society, justify the means.\n\nHere\u2019s how Ocasio-Cortez put it recently: \u201cIf people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees.

Free thought and free speech have been marginalized or altogether obliterated and they're marginalized or obliterated in favor of forced adherence to the ever-changing leftist credo. A credo where Marxism trumps the free market and trigger warnings beat down free thought.\n\nThe Young Americas Foundation just released a study of courses that are being offered at some Ivy League colleges. A few of these are real howlers.\n\nCheck them out, last semester at Columbia, you could have taken a class called fascism, aesthetics and politics. The election of President Donald Trump has renewed interest in the examination of fascism as an ideology, as a political movement and as a form of governance.\n\nLast fall at Cornell, students took histories of the apocalypse from Nostradamus to nuclear winter. Brexit. Immigration and the election of Donald Trump have all been recently heralded as signs of an imminent apocalypse, very understated.\n\nAnd then at Harvard, why not pay $70,000 a year in tuition to study, \"journalism\" in the age of Trump. \u201cPresident Trump's declared war on fake news, his attacks on the press as enemies of the people as well as secular changes in technology and the ways in which the news is produced and delivered have combined to undermine the very notion of truth.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FULL EPISODE\n\nThe political indoctrination is one aspect of what universities are doing to mess with young minds. But there is a lot more. Parents also pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in total for their kids to marinate in an entitled -- it's kind of a pseudo-intellectual grievance culture. Professors and administrators have founded their own type of religion whose adherents are required to embrace manufactured anger and complete oppression.\n\nNow consider the case of a small school called The Evergreen State College, in Washington State.\n\nDocumentarian Mike Nana captured this rise of leftist authoritarianism in real time and he interviewed professors who could see the ideology of racism and white privilege suffocating free expression on campus. Now check this out. These are actual faculty members of Evergreen State College.\n\nProfessor: \u201cRacism exists today in both traditional and modern forms. Racism is an institutionalized multilayered multi-level system that distributes unequal power and resources between white people and people of color as socially identified and disproportionately benefits whites. The racial status quo is comfortable for most whites. Therefore, anything that maintains white comfort is suspect.\u201d\n\nWell, these professor-activists have a very ambitious agenda and a very dark ominous view of life in 21st century America.\n\nProfessor: \u201cWe galvanize white privilege in the form of curriculum. Exulting white canons of fine art, literature, theory and scientific thinking. More so, we don't examine how those canons are made.\u201d\n\nWell, these people sound like they\u2019re cult members, not faculty members.\n\nProfessor: I believe Evergreen can create a more vibrant community of anti-racist activists on our staff and faculty and among our students. If we break our 45-year pattern of occasionally turning toward these issues briefly with deep, but short run commitment that fades, fades and fades.\n\nI'm fading. OK. It doesn't matter that students or faculty on campus don't really show signs of racism or it doesn't matter that they engage in racism because to this thinking racism is just in the air. It's in the water of our country's founding. So, anyone who fails to stand and fight against this oppressive backdrop is guilty. So, minorities in this view are cast as perpetual victims and the universities then reward them for wearing the \u201cI'm oppressed\u201d chips on their shoulders. Here's just a sample of what the group thinks sounds like. This is a meeting of the Evergreen State College Equity Council and the guest speaker Robin D'Angelo.\n\nRobin D'angelo, guest speaker: \u201cThere is a sea of people engaged in a shared delusion. And then there is a few people witnessing the delusion and isolated unable to exchange words or anything. That sense of being alone in a crowd is profound.\u201d\n\nMeeting participant: \u201cAnti-racist frame understands racism as a system.\n\nWhile individual players partake and it's not dependent on individual players. It's embedded in the fabric of the society and it functions to ensure an unequal distribution of basically everything between people of color as a whole and white people as a whole.\u201d\n\nNow note the almost religious certitude that these radicals possess. This is their religion because they are the oracles and anyone who does not accept their ideology, their religious fervor is simply unjust. If you're a racist, if you don't accept it and thus you must be resisted and driven into silence on a college campus at all costs. This is a kind of mental totalitarianism and it's not just confined to faculty meetings or classrooms. Students are being brainwashed into accepting this group think.\n\nNow a few weeks ago Dinesh D'Souza spoke at our alma mater of Dartmouth College and was greeted this way.\n\nStudent: Go home, racist.\n\nThat's very tolerant, isn't it? Now, how can they get away with treating an Indian, an immigrant, and a person of color let alone an alumni of the college that way? Well, because as a conservative, Dinesh does not count. He doesn't buy into their oppression narrative, so he's just as guilty as a white lacrosse player who grew up in Greenwich, who goes to an Ivy League school.\n\nAnd my friends, there is victimhood obsession of course has infected now society at large because they want us all to live on their college campus.\n\nThink about this Jussie Smollett case. Even when his wild allegations couldn't be substantiated, even after it appears that Smollett himself organized the attack, he initially blamed on MAGA hat wearing racists and even after he was charged with filing a false police report, in the eyes of these folks, none of it matters. He ultimately gets a pass in their eyes because the story fits the left's narrative, and he is morally right in their eyes even if kind of confused and sad regarding these current set of facts.\n\nAnd regardless of facts, anyway Trump and his followers are, according to them, violent racists. And if you disagree with that, well you're a racist yourself. Playing by the university rulebook. Well, dissent is not allowed.\n\nAnd liberal victims, fake or otherwise, are entitled to mercy. 20th Century Fox issued a statement today reading Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional onset and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show. We'll see if that changes with the news from Wednesday night.\n\nI'm telling you, redemption is almost limitless when you are a liberal, I guess. The governor and lieutenant governor of Virginia know all about that. Roseanne though, wow, she's still waiting for her letter of apology.\n\nAs parents, we have to use these examples to remind our children of what is expected of them. Teach them to respect themselves and, of course, their fellow man. To halt the spread of this victimhood menace, we have to teach kids to be self-reliant and self-sufficient. Because if you're a victim. You're going to need to be saved. And the left believes your savior is the government. I say, no thanks. I'll leave that to Jesus Christ. Thank you very much.\n\nBut put this all aside for a moment. We have all been given gifts by the Almighty. A soul, a heart and mind capable of changing things for the better and making good choices out of our own free will. And when you start to cling to victim status, you're just giving away your power.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYou're letting others define you. We Americans are a lot better than that.\n\nAnd our kids deserve better than that what they're being fed on college campuses. So, let's expose the frauds and encourage more personal responsibility.

Don\u2019t be fooled by the theatrics: Bernie 2020 isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nAmnesiac pundits prattling on about Bernie\u2019s \u201crecord-setting\u201d haul forget that libertarian congressman Ron Paul raised precisely the same amount of cash in the same amount of time a dozen years ago, during his own campaign for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nPerhaps the commentators fail to remember the last six-million-dollar day because Mr. Paul never became the Republican nominee, just as Democrats will never nominate Bernie, albeit for the opposite reason. Ron Paul lost because he never appealed the mainstream of his party, whereas Bernie will fail because he has so successfully shifted the center of his own.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\u2019 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY WILL FURTHER FRACTURE DEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\nSimilarities abound between the two septuagenarian campaigns. In 2008, Paul ran an ideological race to redefine the Republican platform according to libertarian ideals: fiscal responsibility, balanced budgets, strict construction of the Constitution, non-intervention abroad, and a dramatic reduction in the size and scope of the federal government. Some of those priorities influenced certain policy preferences within the Republican Party, most notably through the Tea Party movement \u2013 a brief but potent force in conservative politics.\n\nEight years later, Bernie Sanders launched his own ideological campaign to push the Democratic Party to the extreme Left. He stoked racial, sexual, and above all class resentment in an effort to radicalize the Democratic base. Unlike Paul\u2019s attempt, Bernie\u2019s crusade proved an unqualified success.\n\nAccording to multiple studies over the past two years, the majority of Millennials now support socialism. During the 2017 off-year elections, candidates endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America won 15 electoral offices in 13 states. An additional 40 openly socialist candidates won their own contests the following year. At the height of the 2018 midterm election campaigns, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez declared the avowedly socialist congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u201cthe future of our party.\u201d\n\nIf the 2020 presidential field is any indication, Perez is right: The Democrats\u2019 future is left. Every declared Democratic candidate favors socialist healthcare and de facto open borders, among other leftist policy priorities. All have also pledged support for a \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d which draft legislation demands, among other things, outlawing airplanes and gas-powered cars, rebuilding every single edifice in the country, and redistributing wealth along ideologically prescribed racial and sexual lines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis last platform plank underlies the insurmountable problem for Bernie\u2019s presidential ambitions: The party he formed has no place left for him. Early election surveys place Bernie, Biden and Beto at the top of the 2020 field \u2013 another gimmick for pundits who mistake name recognition for reliable support. In 2016, Sanders offered Democrats an alternative to Hillary Clinton \u2013 to borrow Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s phrase, \u201cA choice, not an echo.\u201d Three years later, Bernie offers nothing but an old, white, male echo of his physically preferable ideological heirs.\n\nA radicalized Democratic Party has no need for Bernie Sanders; an identity-crazed base has no use for him.

Smollett, 36, now faces one count of felony disorderly conduct, for filing a false police report. Chicago officials expect Smollett to surrender and be arrested Thursday afternoon.\n\nThis story sounded far different on Jan. 29.\n\nSmollett, a black, gay, Trump-loathing actor best known for his role on the TV show \u201cEmpire,\u201d claims that he was walking to his Chicago apartment at 2 a.m., after getting a sandwich at a Subway shop.\n\nFELONY CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST JUSSIE SMOLLETT APPROVED, CHICAGO POLICE SAY\n\nThat\u2019s when, Smollett says, two men, one in a black mask, called him \u201cEmpire f----- n-----,\u201d beat him, slipped a white rope around his neck, and poured \u201can unknown chemical substance\u201d on him, according to the police incident report. As he was punched, Smollett says, one of these men announced: \u201cThis is MAGA country.\u201d\n\nHmmm.....\n\nSmollett\u2019s story immediately should have sounded Klaxons.\n\nFirst, how did these men know that Smollett is gay? Or was this just a lucky guess?\n\nAlso, Chicago is not exactly MAGA country, any more than Provo, Utah, is \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d country.\n\nAnother detail: That night was downright Arctic. During this alleged assault, it was about 9 degrees Fahrenheit, with 12 mph winds. This yields a wind chill, according to the National Weather Service, of about four below zero. Temperatures were plunging that morning, en route to 0 degrees at 6:53 a.m., amid a well-publicized polar vortex that found most Chicagoans barricaded in their homes.\n\nWhat a coincidence that Chicago\u2019s frozen streets were mainly empty, and yet a black, gay, Trump foe would cross paths with a pair of anti-black, anti-gay Trump fans in a city that handed Trump a whopping 12.5 percent of its votes in November 2016. And \u2013 oh, yes \u2013 those two hoodlums just so happened to have a rope on hand, plus a bottle of what now seems to be bleach.\n\nBleach: Never leave home without it.\n\nDespite these abundant questions and anomalies, political and media luminaries on the left pounced. They denounced this episode as, essentially, the handiwork of Donald J. Trump, his allies and supporters.\n\n\u201cWhy all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have a picnic while black and being attacked?\u201d wondered Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. She answered her own question: \u201cIt\u2019s coming from the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, she continued, is \u201cseparating and dividing, and he is basically emboldening those folks who feel this way, maybe never said and never talked about it, never could act it out, but now they\u2019re on it.\u201d\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said: \u201cWhen one of the most famous black and gay men in America is not safe, the message is clearer than it has ever been. The dangerous lies spewing from the right wing is (sic) killing & hurting our people.\u201d\n\nThe same day that this scenario unfolded, GQ magazine published Joshua Rivera\u2019s rant on \u201cthe blind rage of late-stage whiteness\u201d beneath this incendiary headline: \u201cThe Racist, Homophobic Attack on Jussie Smollett Is Far-Right America\u2019s Endgame.\u201d\n\nRivera complained bitterly that police called this a \u201cpossible hate crime.\u201d He moaned: \u201cThe cautious wording is one last wound inflicted on Smollett\u2019s battered body, a careful hedging of bets that don\u2019t need hedging \u2013 a crime scene involving a corpse is not discussed as a \u2018possible death.\u2019\u201d\n\nCriticizing \u201cthe vice president of America\u201d and his views on gay rights, actress Ellen Page told CBS \u201cLate Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert: \u201cIf you are in a position of power, and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them \u2013 you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering \u2013 what do you think is gonna happen? Kids are gonna be abused, and they\u2019re gonna kill themselves. And people are gonna be beaten on the street.\u201d\n\nPage forgot to mention Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s highest-profile gay rights controversy. As Indiana\u2019s Republican governor, he signed a religious freedom bill on March 26, 2015, to protect a Christian baker\u2019s right to choose not to bake custom cakes for same-sex weddings. When gay rights groups howled, Pence retreated more quickly than De Gaulle.\n\nPence prodded the Hoosier State\u2019s Legislature to pass a repeal measure, which he signed that April 2. So, it took Pence one week to do precisely what gay rights activists wanted, and yet they still drop-kick him in the teeth for it.\n\nThese folks, and others on the left who zoomed to Smollett\u2019s defense, should feel rather silly, now that his tall tale has unraveled. Chicago police announced earlier this week that they no longer consider Smollett a victim. Two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were arrested as possible suspects. But the clearly non-white gentlemen of Nigerian ancestry were released without charges.\n\n\u201cWe are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump,\u201d the brothers told CBS News in a statement. \u201cWe were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.\u201d\n\nSomeone eager to catch his tormentors should itch to speak with the police \u2013 as often as necessary. However, Chicago cops tried to get Smollett to sit down for a follow-up interview. Instead, he hid behind his attorneys.\n\nAs Smollett\u2019s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, stated: \u201cSmollett\u2019s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.\u201d\n\nInterrogation is for losers! Far better to have one\u2019s lawyers engage in \u201cactive dialogue\u201d with inquisitive cops.\n\nFurthermore, news reports now indicate that Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers to bash him and may have rehearsed this, perhaps to gain attention, turbocharge his career, and bathe in the glory and self-affirmation of victim status \u2013 the social justice equivalent of the Bronze Star.\n\nSmollett might have had another motive: to savor these personal benefits, at the expense of his arch-nemesis, President Trump. Smollett is virulently, obscenely anti-Trump. Consider some of what he has said about the president of the United States, via Twitter:\n\n\u2022 \u201cShut the hell up you b---- a-- n----. You will continue to run this country further into the ground and risk lives every time you breathe. You\u2019re not the president. Just a dumpster full of hate. FOH. [F--- outta here] Sick to my stomach that literal s--- currently represents America to the world.\u201d\n\n(This also confirms that Smollett has no idea what \u201cliteral\u201d means.)\n\n\u2022 \u201c@AOC is only speaking facts. This is so far beyond political party affiliation. Across the world ... no matter the border ... from sea to shining sea ... 45 and all his white hooded cohorts are a national disgrace. And if you support them ... so are you. Clowns.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cDear @realDonaldTrump ... you are a disgusting, racist, piece of trash ... Sincerely, Everyone who is not a disgusting, racist, piece of trash.\u201d\n\nGiven this extreme animosity against Trump, it hardly is surprising that Smollett appears to have scripted this fictional mayhem and then penned a disturbing line of dialogue to be uttered by one of his story\u2019s villains: \u201cThis is MAGA country.\u201d\n\nFor nearly three weeks, those four words smeared Trump, his circle of advisers and associates, and the 63 million Americans who voted for him \u2013 even though zero evidence ever emerged that even one of these millions of people laid a cuticle on Smollett.\n\nSmollett\u2019s attorneys issued a statement Sunday that now looks comical: He has been \u201cfurther victimized,\u201d they said, by accusations that \u201cJussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf convicted for the charge that a Cook Country grand jury handed down on Wednesday evening, Smollett deserves the full three years in prison due to anyone guilty of filing a false crime report \u2014 a Class 4 felony under 720 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/26-1(a)(2-10).\n\nBeyond this, Jussie Smollett deserves the immediate termination of his career and the entire nation\u2019s permanent, unbridled revulsion for needlessly grinding rock salt and Tabasco sauce into America\u2019s perpetually reopened racial wounds and ever-widening political divides.\n\nAuthor's note: Michael Malarkey furnished research for this opinion piece, as did Alex Pfeiffer of Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DEROY MURDOCK"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/judge-andrew-napolitano-trumps-brazen-unconstitutional-overreach", "text": "Last week, President Donald Trump followed through on a threat he had been making for months. It was not a blistering or insulting tweet. It was not an attack on the press or congressional Democrats. It was an attack on the Constitution.\n\nHere is the back story.\n\nIn 2015, Trump began offering that as president, he would build a \"big, beautiful wall\" along the border of the United States and Mexico and that Mexico would pay for the wall. His stated purpose throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and beyond was that a wall is necessary to stop the onslaught of immigrants illegally entering the United States at places other than lawful ports of entry.\n\nJUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO: TRUMP, EX-AIDE CLIFF SIMS AND AN INCREDIBLE FREE SPEECH DEBATE\n\nHe also offered his personal view that many of the folks entering through these unapproved areas are gang members who are trafficking in drugs and human slavery.\n\nAfter the president of Mexico rejected paying for a wall, Trump asked Congress to do so. Curiously, he did not ask for the wall payment during the first two years of his presidency -- when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress -- but waited until the Democrats, who largely oppose the wall, were in control of the House.\n\nSo determined has he been to build a wall -- any wall, so as to be able to assert that he has fulfilled a campaign promise -- that he has dropped his demand that Mexico pay for it, modified his demand that it even be a wall (because his own Border Patrol folks told him that a wall would impair their ability to observe behavior on the south side of it) and reduced the length of his proposed barrier from 1,000 miles to 55 miles. Congress still refused.\n\nSo determined has he been to build a barrier of any length that he rejected budgetary measures that had been passed by both the Republican Senate and the then-Republican House, and permitted about one-third of the federal government to shut down for 35 days at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. During negotiations, he demanded $5.7 billion as a down payment for his $25 billion wall. Then, seeing the misery the shutdown caused, he relented and signed essentially the same spending legislation that had been passed before and that he had rejected, though it was only for three weeks. He continued to demand $5.7 billion, but all Congress would give him was $1.4 billion for border security, much of it not for a wall and none of it for where he wants to build.\n\nAfter he signed the legislation with little money for the wall, he signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. He described the migrants there as being engaged in an \"invasion,\" so he ordered the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to divert unspent appropriations, money authorized by Congress for other purposes, to building a wall.\n\nWas it legal for him to do that? In a word: No. As my colleagues at The Wall Street Journal wrote last week: President Trump, meet Justice Jackson. Robert Jackson was the last attorney general of the United States and the last justice of the U.S. Supreme Court never to have graduated from law school. He was also a gifted jurist who played a pivotal role in a famous case in 1952.\n\nIn 1952, when American steelworkers went on strike and the U.S. military was fighting the Korean War, President Harry Truman asked Congress for the authority to occupy the steel mills and pay nonunion workers to replace the strikers. When Congress refused, Truman declared a state of emergency and directed his secretary of commerce, Charles Sawyer, to hire workers at federal expense to operate the mills.\n\nWhen the mills' owners challenged Truman's order, a federal district judge enjoined the president from enforcing it, and the Supreme Court upheld the injunction. Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer, known as the Steel Seizure Case, held that the president was without authority to occupy private property and pay others to do so without express appropriations from Congress because the Constitution defines clearly that no federal dollars can be spent without an appropriation by Congress.\n\nNow, back to Justice Jackson. Rarely in Supreme Court history has a concurring opinion been cited and relied upon by future courts more than the majority opinion, but this case is the exception. In concurring with the majority on the court, Justice Jackson offered his now iconic views of the presidency vis-a-vis Congress under the Constitution.\n\nWhen the president acts pursuant to authority granted to him by the Congress in an area of government delegated to him by the Constitution, his authority is at its peak, and he is free to exercise it as he sees fit.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cautioned that the U.S. would not be able to team up with, nor share, crucial intelligence information that countries that go forth in enabling Huawei Technologies.\n\n\u201cWhether through classic economic espionage, intellectual property theft, or espionage on behalf of a government, the global footprint and technology reach of Huawei easily makes it a security risk to U.S. interests,\u201d Erik Rasmussen, Head of Cybersecurity and Risk Management Solutions at public accounting firm Grobstein Teeple, told Fox News. \u201cGiven the size of the company, it is a difficult undertaking to quickly and swiftly track spying with or without Huawei\u2019s knowledge, but direct influence on business operations by the Chinese government is undeniable.\u201d\n\nU.S authorities have expressed a growing concern the telecom conglomerate could \u2013 as a result of 2017 legislation in China that permits the government to keep tabs on people under the guise of national security \u2013 undertake \u201cundetected espionage\u201d on users.\n\nANNUAL UN GATHERING A HOTBED FOR SPIES, MANY FROM US ADVERSARIES\n\nThe 2017 legislation mandates all China-owned companies must comply with the government\u2019s intelligence wing should it be requested, meaning that if Huawei is asked to do so and denies to so, they could be breaking their own national security laws.\n\nThe issue has not only caused a schism in U.S. relations with Canada \u2013 who have conveyed frustration in having absorbed retaliation from the Chinese government for detaining the company\u2019s CFO Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request by the U.S \u2013 but threatens alliances with Europe too.\n\nGermany this week made the preliminary determination to continue to the process in allowing Huawei to partake in developing their high-speed internet infrastructure after their own investigation found no sufficient proof its equipment could be used to spy. Britain is currently examining the tech giant\u2019s products, and is expected to make a decision in the coming weeks.\n\nOver the past year, the Trump team has been ramping up pressure on its European allies to drastically limit or entirely rebuff Huawei\u2019s involvement in both developing the 5G infrastructure and its presence on existing networks. While Huawei has mostly been barred in the United States, its foothold in Europe is strong.\n\n\u201cNext to Apple and Samsung, Huawei is the world\u2019s largest mobile technology company in terms of market share, so if the company is compromised from within, the risk is undeniable,\u201d Rasmussen said. \u201cGiven the historical alliances between the US and many European countries where Huawei technology is common, there is a vested interest to track this accordingly and share information when prudent. The UK and Germany will naturally have to weigh the costs and benefits to allowing risky technology in their country.\u201d\n\nPENTAGON POINTS TO CHINA, RUSSIA COMPETITION IN NEW AI STRATEGY\n\nHowever, the Huawei president and former Chinese army engineer Ren Zhengfei \u2013 whose daughter Wanzhou has been held Canadian authorities for almost three awaiting possible extradition \u2013 continues to deny that the company assists the Chinese government in collecting intelligence through its devices. \u201cEven if we were required by Chinese law, we would firmly reject that,\u201d Zhengfei said in a CBS interview.\n\nThe Chinese government has also consistently and firmly refuted U.S. accusations that they have either the will or capacity to funnel off personal data and information.\n\nExperts and analysts remain far from convinced.\n\n\u201cIf these pieces of electronic equipment used in telecom infrastructure are compromised \u2013 for example, by having hidden backdoors, which allow for access with specific access codes \u2013 this would enable Chinese intelligence to have access to western telecoms networks, \u2018sniffing\u2019 and listening to all information such as data and voice going through that equipment,\u201d explained J. Eduardo Campos, Chief Information Security Specialist and founder of Embedded-Knowledge Inc. \u201cHuawei denies it vehemently, but given the recent history of State-sponsored hacking by the Chinese government, it makes anyone suspicious. Moreover, Chinese tech companies could, in theory, be compelled by the Chinese government to modify their technology for spying purposes. And we would never know it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Campos, the 5G technology \u2013 the next iteration of mobile network technology \u2013 could potentially help cities become smarter, improving traffic management, citizen services, and access to public information from mobile devices. Therefore, it will enable many types of cutting-edge applications, such as self-driving cars and remotely operated devices.\n\n\u201cThey will be able to send and receive large amounts of data faster than it is currently possible. One way of seeing a potential threat is that an increased reliance on mobile technologies means its disruption would have serious consequences, both in terms of safety as well as the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he observed. \u201cImagine that a failure because a remote hacking by a foreign power could lead to the death of patients, the crash of self-driving cars, or even just halting down airplanes on the ground because of massive system outages. This poses real national security risks. The US government has all rights to crack down on this and at least demand extra measures to protect the infrastructure against companies that operate too close to foreign powers not aligned with the US, such as Huawei technologies.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has been urging Western technology companies to get up to speed with their Chinese counterparts in mastering the 5G modal.\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration is in the tough position of balancing free market principles with national and cybersecurity. The President and his advisors are tasked with regulatory oversight of 5G implementation, and they understand that this new technology has revolutionary capabilities in terms of innovation and economic growth,\u201d added Theresa Payton, Former White House Chief Information Officer under George W.

While the 37-year-old celebrated on Tuesday, the party actually took place on Wednesday at the Upper East Side hotel The Mark, Vanity Fair reported. The festivities were organized by Serena Williams, who booked out the penthouse suite, which features two floors, five bedrooms, four fireplaces, six bathrooms, as well as extensive views of Central Park. According to Tatler, the tennis pro personally covered the cost of the $75,000-a-night room bill.\n\nWHY KATE MIDDLETON SKIPPED MEGHAN MARKLE'S BABY SHOWER\n\nAnd while the Markle has flown out to the U.S. on a private jet, which is estimated to have cost over $100,000, Vanity Fair noted that the plane belongs to one of her close friends in Toronto, who covered the cost as a present for the expecting royal.\n\nRoyal commentator Victoria Arbiter told Fox News that while baby showers are an American tradition, the British monarchy has no trouble with the former American actress celebrating overseas because she\u2019s not breaking a royal rule.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no reason why Meghan shouldn\u2019t have a baby shower,\u201d she explained. \u201cShowers are largely an American tradition and [husband Prince] Harry, along with the rest of the royal family, would be more than happy for her to honor her own tradition and customs. Baby showers are not customary in the U.K. as friends and family usually give gifts once a baby has been born. It\u2019s just a different way of doing things and not because of any perceived \u2018rules.\u2019 Meghan\u2019s friends throwing her a shower is a generous gesture and no doubt the time with them in New York will have been much appreciated.\u201d\n\nBritish royal expert Katie Nicholl, who is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cHarry and Meghan: Life, Loss and Love,\u201d pointed out that while some critics are worried Markle is spending taxpayer funds for the extravagant getaway, it was her friends who footed the bill. Therefore, Markle isn\u2019t flaunting her wealth as the newest member of the British royal family. And while baby showers aren\u2019t customary, Nicholl said Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton\u2019s mother and sister previously threw a party when she was expecting.\n\nPREGNANT MEGHAN MARKLE ARRIVES IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n\u201cA lot has been made of how much the shower has cost, but this is not being paid for by the taxpayers, but by her friends, so I really don\u2019t see why anyone should have a problem with it,\u201d said Nicholl. \u201cIt is the case that a baby shower is more of an American phenomenon than a British one and I am told Meghan was very keen to have a shower and thrilled that her friends Serena Williams and Amal Clooney offered to host the party. They really pulled out all the stops and made it a fabulous celebration for Meghan.\u201d\n\nRoyal expert Leslie Carroll said she is stunned Markle would be slammed by the press for participating in a baby shower that was hosted by her closest friends. Carroll pointed out that as a former Hollywood star, Markle is still considered to be an outsider and will be scrutinized by British tabloids for every move she makes \u2014 and it will only worsen once she gives birth this spring.\n\n\u201cI view this as yet another campaign or effort by the British tabloids to \u2018otherize\u2019 Meghan,\u201d said Carroll. \u201cShe\u2019s the first biracial American actress to marry into their royal family\u2026 [they] always need to create a villain(ess) in this thousand year-plus soap opera that is the British monarchy. Now it\u2019s Meghan\u2019s turn.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to the royal family, royal expert Marlene Koenig said they wouldn\u2019t want Markle to give up her American traditions or close circle of friends, despite her title.

They thrive on negativity.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s only one downside to the baby shower, they pointed out, is how high profile it was. Markle, along with her celebrity guests, were frequently photographed out and about in New York City as part of the celebration. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said Markle could have benefitted from a more top-secret affair to avoid ruthless paparazzi and backlash from the press.\n\n\u201cBaby showers are now regular events here in the UK as they are in the US,\u201d explained Seward. \u201cNot everyone has them but almost. Certainly, the Duchess of Cambridge had one, but it was very private, and we had no idea who attended. I am pretty sure [Princess] Diana didn\u2019t have one, as they were not so fashionable then, but I think Fergie did and the Countess of Wessex. They are, of course, an American invention, which has crept over here in the last 20-30 years. They are not considered in any way vulgar for members of the royal family to enjoy, just a nice way for friends to be able to say congratulations.\n\n\u201cIt is a little unfortunate it was so high profile and she was seen flying in and out on a private jet. But it would have been privately funded and nothing to do with the British taxpayer, so I see no reason for her not to have fun and enjoy it all, which she obviously did.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cMeghan\u2019s [baby shower] has been unusual in how public it has been,\u201d added Nicholl. \u201cIt has felt quite celebrity with all the paparazzi and high-profile names in attendance.\u201d\n\nBut the celebration isn\u2019t over for Markle.

The company could also face penalties from the government agencies.\n\n\"At Ford, we believe that trust in our brand is earned by acting with integrity and transparency,\" Kim Pittel, the company's vice president for environment and safety engineering, said Thursday. \"We have a process for looking at how we perform and behave in our broad and complex company.\"\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, which monitor emissions and mileage, have been informed of the probe, according to the company.\n\nThe EPA said in a statement that Ford disclosed the issues on Tuesday.\n\n\"The investigation is ongoing and the information is too incomplete for EPA to reach any conclusions,\" the agency said. \"We take the potential issues seriously and are following up with the company to fully understand the circumstances behind this disclosure.\"\n\nThe problems do not involve \"defeat device\" software that activates pollution controls for emissions tests and turns them off on the road, according to Ford. For years, Volkswagen used a defeat device to cheat on diesel emissions tests until they were caught by university researchers and a nonprofit organization. Ford said the investigation is focused on vehicles with gasoline engines.\n\nIn an interview, Pittel said it's too early to tell how widespread the problem is or if it goes beyond 2017 models. \"We're just going to go where the investigation takes us,\" she said. \"We will be very, very thorough.\"\n\nMost emissions and mileage tests are done by automakers and spot-checked for accuracy by the EPA and California.

Things were not going so well in her life. It was kind of a comeback performance for her 15 years after \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 and the earlier stages in her career when things were going so smoothly and great. \u2026 You could relate it to the ups and downs in Judy\u2019s own career.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople weren\u2019t sure that she was going to be up for the role,\u201d shared Malone. \u201c\u2026 But Judy Garland was someone that no matter what was happening in her personal life, she always brought it when she was onscreen.

So to speak.\n\nThe all-new 2019 model is the first Nissan sedan available with all-wheel-drive, which gives it twice as many driven wheels as before. It\u2019s one of only three cars in the segment that offer the all-weather option, along with the Subaru Legacy and Ford Fusion, which will soon be discontinued to make room for more SUVs.\n\nMost midsize sedans don\u2019t have it because most people don\u2019t really need it, and the ones that do are often also looking for the added ground clearance they get in an SUV. Nissan is apparently hoping there are more than a few customers left in the snowbelt states who\u2019d still prefer to keep a low profile.\n\nNISSAN INVENTED THE BEST HUMP SEAT EVER\n\nTo drive the point home, it even turned an Altima into a snowmobile by putting a set of tracks on it. As of now, they are not on the accessories list.\n\nSeeing as how an All-tima costs just $1,350 more than a front-wheel-drive model, which starts at $24,645, it may be a safety-first no-brainer for everyone. You never know when you\u2019re going to get transferred to Minneapolis, after all. Both versions come with a 188 hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder and CVT automatic transmission standard. (A revolutionary 268 hp 2.0-liter turbo with variable compression is optional on some FWD trims.)\n\nAside from the cash, the only things you have to give up to get all-wheel-drive are a couple of miles per gallon, The AWD Altima is rated at 29/30 mpg combined, depending on the model, compared to the FWD\u2019s 31/32 mpg. Those are excellent numbers across the board for the Altima\u2019s class.\n\nThe new Altima is a smidge bigger than the old one, which was already one of the largest \u201cmidsize\u201d sedans. Rear legroom is generous, and the trunk is big enough to help make a case for it against a utility vehicle. The sharply-creased bodywork and floating roof effect are cribbed from the Maxima and Murano. Inside, it has a clean design, with simple controls, a tablet-style infotainment system and -- in the top of the line Platinum trim level I tested \u2013 a snazzy wood strip stretching from door to door.\n\nThe Platinum cost $34,025, but comes fully-loaded with every Altima feature, including automatic emergency brakes, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, a 360-degree camera and Nissan\u2019s ProPilot Assist semi-autonomous driving aid, which can self-steer the car within a lane as long as you have a hand touching the steering wheel. ProPilot Assist does a better job of keeping the car centered than most lane-keeping systems, but only works if there are clear lines for it to see and will quickly disengage if it doesn\u2019t. So you\u2019ll want to keep your eyes on the road too.\n\nRegardless of what kind of road that is, the Altima impresses. It\u2019s smooth and quiet on the highway and can soak up bumps around town, but is still tight enough to take on a twisty mountain pass without making a mess of it. Unfortunately, the weather didn\u2019t cooperate while I had it. Which is to say it was beautiful, so I\u2019ll have to get back to you about how well the all-wheel-drive works in such situations. Nissan does make a lot of trucks and SUVs, though, so it's not exactly new to the concept.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that the Altima feels much more solid and refined overall than the outgoing edition, which I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in thanks to its ubiquity as a rental car. This one deserves a better fate, but I won't complain if a desk agent hands me the keys to one, even if I'm on a ski trip.\n\nMORE FROM FOX NEWS AUTOS"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/restaurant-serving-brunch-with-period-pancakes-tampon-macarons-to-raise-awareness-for-charity", "text": "A restaurant in London is hosting the most original brunch idea around.

The group spent 10 years in negotiations to acquire the 16 mm movie film, which shows Earhart\u2019s Lockheed Electra taking off from Lae in Papua New Guinea on a short test flight on July 1, 1937, and the subsequent refueling operation.\n\nEarhart famously disappeared while attempting to fly around the world. The aviator and her navigator, Fred Noonan, went missing on July 2, 1937, during a flight from Papua New Guinea to Howland Island in the Pacific. Their fate became one of the great mysteries of the 20th century and is still hotly debated in the 21st century as well.\n\nAMELIA EARHART DISCOVERY? RESEARCHERS EYE PAPUA NEW GUINEA 'WRECK SITE'\n\nThe key detail in the film is an aluminum patch on the plane\u2019s fuselage, which may correspond with an aluminum fragment discovered in 1991 by TIGHAR on the remote island of Nikumaroro, a coral atoll 1,200 miles from the Marshall Islands.\n\n\u201cThe key to a conclusive yea or nay is a comparison between the unique rivet pattern and deformation on the artifact and the unique rivet pattern and deformation visible in photos of the patch on the Electra,\u201d explained TIGHAR, on its website. \u201cThe problem has always been the poor resolution in the handful of historic photos that show the patch.\u201d\n\nTIGHAR was contacted in 2008 by a woman who said she had photos and film footage of Earhart, Noonan and the plane in Lae. \u201cThe photos and movies were said to have been taken by a relative of the owner's ex-husband who was in the mining business during the great New Guinea gold rush of the 1930s and happened to be in Lae on July 1st,\u201d the group said, adding that a letter from the photographer dated July 2, 1937, documents the film\u2019s authenticity.\n\nAMELIA EARHART SIGNED DOCUMENT DISCOVERED IN ATTIC BOX\n\nOne of the still photos of the plane\u2019s refueling was particularly intriguing \u2013 it showed the rear section of the Electra with the aluminum patch. Researchers are keen to see whether the image corresponds with the aluminum fragment discovered in 1991.\n\n\u201cOnce we had the photos and film in hand, we realized that the still photos are actually taken from frames in the 16mm movie film,\u201d said TIGHAR. \u201cThat\u2019s good news. The film was probably shot at twenty-four frames per second. If the camera lingered on the right rear of the aircraft for only one second we have not one but twenty-four photos of the patch.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a forensic imaging perspective, it\u2019s like hitting the lottery,\u201d said TIGHAR\u2019s forensic imaging expert Jeff Glickman, in the statement.\n\nAMELIA EARHART MYSTERY SOLVED? SCIENTIST '99 PERCENT' SURE BONES FOUND BELONG TO AVIATOR\n\nTIGHAR is now working to get the brittle, decades-old acetate film scanned at high resolution, a delicate and expensive process. \u201cOnce the imagery is safely rendered in digital format, Jeff can start the painstaking process of forensic analysis,\u201d the group explained.\n\nTIGHAR Director Ric Gillespie told Fox News that the footage will be released at some point in the future, but not right away.\n\nOne theory is that Earhart died a castaway after landing her plane on Nikumaroro. Some 13 human bones were found on Nikumaroro, also known as Gardner Island, three years after Earhart\u2019s disappearance.\n\nDOZENS HEARD AMELIA EARHART RADIO FOR HELP AFTER CRASHING INTO PACIFIC: REPORT\n\nLast year, a scientific study claimed to shed new light on the enduring mystery.\n\nRichard Jantz, an emeritus anthropology professor at the University of Tennessee, argued that bones discovered on the Pacific Island of Nikumaroro in 1940 were likely Earhart\u2019s remains. The research contradicts a forensic analysis of the remains in 1941 that described the bones as belonging to a male. The bones, which were subsequently lost, continue to be a source of debate.\n\nThere are a number of competing theories about what ultimately happened to Earhart.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile some are convinced that Nikumaroro is Earhart\u2019s final resting place, another theory suggests that she met her end on Mili Atoll, in the Marshall Islands.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.

CPAC, as it\u2019s known, will focus in part on those policies, like the Green New Deal. The annual conference of hardcore conservatives kicks off next Wednesday at National Harbor, where Schlapp said the theme will be \u201cWhat Makes America Great\u201d \u2013 a not-so-subtle play on Trump\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\n'Socialism does not make America great.' \u2014 Matt Schlapp\n\n\u201cAs conservatives who understand the founding of the country, there are very specific principles of what make America great,\u201d said Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. \u201cAnd the thumbnail of that is socialism does not make America great. Socialism is actually completely opposed to Americanism. And that will be explained in a variety of ways throughout CPAC.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the program kicks off Thursday with Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, two outspoken GOP members of the House Freedom Caucus, discussing the surge in socialism in America with Schlapp, organizers said.\n\nThousands of attendees \u2013 typically including many college-aged conservatives \u2013 gather every year for the summit. Organizers are hopeful President Trump and Vice President Pence show up, as they have in prior years, though the speeches are not yet confirmed.\n\n\u201cI talked with the president, he obviously loves coming to CPAC. He wants to be there,\u201d Schlapp said.\n\nThe White House is also sending Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and former television host for an appearance Thursday. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will also be coming from the Trump administration, a department spokesman said. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is being interviewed by journalist Vince Coglianese on stage that day, according to organizers.\n\nExpect plenty of GOP lawmakers this year to talk about how to get conservative policies implemented amid divided government, Schlapp said. Among those expected include South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Georgia Sen. David Perdue and Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn.\n\n\u201cThe congressional majority in the Senate and the minority in the House \u2013 they\u2019re going through a lot of changes, and we want to hear from them on how they are going tackle a Nancy Pelosi speakership,\u201d Schlapp said.\n\nThe gathering comes amid the rise of democratic socialists like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates embracing progressive causes like \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d One CPAC panel is being devoted to discussing the Green New Deal, the radical environmental plan pushed by Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nA panel on \u201cwhat makes America great\u201d will include Sen.

Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, writer Andrew McCarthy and reporter Chuck Ross are scheduled to discuss Mueller\u2019s investigation during a Saturday panel on judges and prosecutors.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller probe gets right to this question about why America is unique,\u201d Schlapp said. \u201cBecause the individual has very specific rights. And what conservatives fear with special counsels is those rights get trampled on. And I fear that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with the Mueller probe.\u201d\n\nThe summit also comes amid outrage from conservatives over proposed abortion laws in states like Virginia. He said speakers will address \u201cwhat the radical abortion movement is all about today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in barbarous times, and we\u2019ll be talking about that on the main stage at CPAC,\u201d Schlapp said.\n\nAlso during the summit, Dore Gold, a former Israeli diplomat, will present a history of Israel and several conservative commentators will debate the proper approach to Syria. Conservative commentators Michelle Malkin, Mark Levin, Dennis Prager and the \u201cDiamond and Silk\u201d duo are expected to address attendees, as is Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party.\n\nAs is tradition, the gathering will include a straw poll, which will ask people to assess the president\u2019s performance. It will also poll the 2020 Republican primary, including possible GOP challengers to Trump. It will ask attendees who they think Democrats will nominate in the presidential race. And a new question this year asks attendees to rate the honesty of several specific media figures, organizers said."}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/ex-enron-ceo-jeffrey-skilling-released-from-federal-custody", "text": "Former Enron Corp.

Durban is a noisy city \u2013 it has the busiest port in sub-Saharan Africa, and its metro area consists of an estimated 3.4 million people.\n\nThe rescue team had to dig more than 20 feet into the ground to reach the baby. After nearly four hours, they were able to extract the baby and airlift her to a hospital, where she was treated for hypothermia.\n\nThe story of the miraculous rescue of this baby would make most people teary-eyed.

Had the baby not survived, the whole mission would have been considered a failure.\n\nWhen it comes to these types of situations, we always give life the benefit of the doubt. If someone is trapped in a building that has caught fire, firefighters don\u2019t stop and debate if the person is worth saving. They rush into the burning building, putting their own lives at risk, to save the other. In fact, they would get in trouble if they didn\u2019t act.\n\nBut when it comes to abortion, we suspend this sense of urgency to protect life. We turn it into a debate about when a life becomes worth saving.\n\nThis logic falls apart quickly when you ask: What is the difference between a fully-formed baby who is a few inches away inside the mother\u2019s womb, and a three-day-old baby who is 20 feet underground in a storm drain?\n\nFor me, there\u2019s only one clear choice in this debate: We must protect life, in all its forms and stages.

Not only will he not marry her, he is looking for the exit ramp. Some folks excuse the situation by claiming that this would have been a marital union that would not have lasted. But I am more concerned about an ethos where young women put themselves in this situation, thinking that cohabitation is eventually going to get them where they want to go, and ending up with broken dreams and lives.\n\nMarriage actually offers protection, both legal and financial, and women are doing themselves a disservice not to require a commitment when they give away their best years with no promises made in return. As a society, we have seen women gain their voices in a number of important areas recently, and it is my hope that this will be the next frontier for women to demand they be heard.\n\nWhile it is a very controversial topic, new research this week shows that marriage still beats cohabitation for satisfaction, stability, and commitment.\n\nFIVE LESSONS TO HELP YOU ENJOY A LASTING MARRIAGE\n\nThree key findings from a December 2018 survey of 2000 adults by the Wheatley Institution and the National Marriage Project are being released this week:\n\n1. Married adults were more likely than cohabiting individuals to report being highly satisfied in their relationship. Specifically, 51 percent of married adults in the survey were in the top relationship satisfaction group, versus 40 percent of cohabiting adults.\n\n2. Married individuals were more likely to report higher levels of commitment in their relationship than cohabiting individuals. Specifically, 46 percent of married adults were in the top relationship commitment group vs. slightly over 30 percent of cohabiting adults.\n\n3. Married individuals were more likely to report higher levels of stability in their relationship than cohabiting individuals. Specifically, 54 percent of married adults were in the top relationship stability group, vs. 28 percent of cohabiting adults.\n\nYears ago, my husband and I hosted a small wedding for a young couple who had no money. My husband is a former rugby player turned clergyman \u2013 a man\u2019s man, to be sure. He strongly encouraged the young man to commit in marriage to the woman who was already the mother of his baby. The couple is now thriving nine years later, with a second child; and they are thankful that someone cared enough to step in and give them loving direction.\n\nAt their wedding, a dozen young women came up to my husband and asked, \u201cWould you talk to my (usually live-in) boyfriend? He just won\u2019t commit and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d As gently as he could, my husband told them that they don\u2019t need to give themselves away without the promise of a stable future in the covenant of the marriage vows, that young men need to be held accountable or they will take what they want with sometimes little thought or conscience. Pretty old fashioned, I know. This is sincerely not intended to be male bashing, but rather to recognize that in addition to men\u2019s responsibility, women bear some of the onus if they are letting it happen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe cohabitation versus marriage choice also correlates with Professor Scott Stanley\u2019s \u201cSliding versus Deciding\u201d premise. That happens when people slide into a relationship transition and they let things happen to them, or allow others to make a decision for them, rather than being intentional and directing their own lives. When people make a deliberate and thoughtful decision, as for marriage, Stanley says they are more committed to the outcomes and future repercussions of the decision.\n\nProfessor Stanley\u2019s research, as well as these new findings from the Wheatley Institution and the National Marriage Project are further reasons this National Marriage Week (Feb. 7 to 14 every year) to consider dating with the clear goal of pursuing discernment toward lifelong commitment. One\u2019s \u201cbest years\u201d are too precious to be lost to someone who won\u2019t commit to a future."}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/first-born-only-child-middle-child-what-birth-order-reveals-about-you-and-why-you-should-care", "text": "Which description is most like you?\n\n1: A natural leader and perfectionist, you are logical, technical, well-organized, conscientious, a good reader, and a list-maker.

After studying birth order for years, I\u2019ve seen these descriptions play out over and over. Birth order isn\u2019t an exact science, because not all characteristics fit every person in that birth order. Variables such as the number of years between kids, gender, physical, emotional, or mental differences, adoption, death, blended families and a critical-eyed parent can change that birth order (for more, see \"The Birth Order Book\").\n\nWhy should you care about birth order? Because the role you played in your family has everything to do with how you perceive \u201creality.\u201d It\u2019s why a brother and sister can view the same growing-up years differently. And that perceived reality affects how you feel about yourself and relate to others.\n\nIf you\u2019re a firstborn.\n\nYou had an incredible advantage and disadvantage no other child in your family had \u2013 your parent(s) all to yourself for a while. You were the guinea pig for their parental experiments. Everything you did right or wrong was heightened. When you reached for a forbidden item, you were told, \u201cDon\u2019t touch that!\u201d in an excited tone. By the time your second brother was born, your parents barely noticed he had his finger in the electrical outlet.\n\nYou walked and talked earlier than your siblings, had a large vocabulary, and acted like an adult because you always interacted with adults. Your parents made a big deal out of everything you did, so you became a perfectionist with only one \u201cright way\u201d to do things. Anything else is \u201cwrong.\u201d That\u2019s why it drives you crazy when others \u2013 partners, kids, or coworkers \u2013 don\u2019t do tasks the same way you\u2019d do them, don\u2019t pursue goals with the same excellence you do, or don\u2019t take life as seriously. That\u2019s why you assume leadership of a project or take it on as a solo act. You expect a lot out of yourself and others because you\u2019ve been groomed to be highly achievement oriented.\n\nIf you\u2019re an only child.\n\nYou have firstborn traits times three.

You\u2019re used to working independently, so that\u2019s most comfortable for you. After all, no one can jump the high bar of your expectations. Problem is, you\u2019re even tougher on yourself than you are on others.\n\nIf you\u2019re a middleborn.\n\nSince you\u2019re not the superhuman, driven-to-excellence firstborn and you\u2019re not the cute baby of the family, you grew up in the hazy, anonymous \u201cmiddle\u201d where you weren\u2019t often noticed. In fact, you were the one least likely to be missed if you went AWOL at the dinner table. You could get away with being lazy sometimes because your parents didn\u2019t expect you to accomplish as much as your firstborn sibling. In fact, whatever he or she was like, you went the opposite way. After all, why try to compete with the best?\n\nBecause you were stuck between the hard-driving firstborn and the baby, who couldn\u2019t seem to get anything done without help, you frequently played \u201cpeacemaker\u201d at home. You carried that role into your loyal friend network too. But wanting everyone to get along so the waters of life stay smooth opens the door for others to easily take advantage of you.\n\nIf you\u2019re a lastborn.\n\nLife to you is a thrill ride from one adventure to another. You\u2019re highly social, spontaneous, thrive on being entertainment central, and easily make people laugh. People swarm to you like ants to honey. Growing up, you were the manipulative charmer who could get your siblings or parents to do anything for you \u2013 even things you should have been doing for yourself.

They\u2019ve all attended the same church.\n\nAt a time where it seems like your career could be at stake if you publicly mention your religious affiliation, seeing celebrities come out of their biblical closet on social media is a breath of fresh air. This trend is not only surpassing Page Six, but it\u2019s getting the interest of mainstream Hollywood producers, legendary rappers and visionary tech entrepreneurs.\n\nWhen Pratt stood on the stage of the MTV Music Awards to accept his Generation Award, he delivered a captivating three-minute speech self-titled \u201cNine Rules From Chris Pratt, Generation Award Winner.\u201d In typical Pratt fashion, he sandwiches bits of silliness around the message that he wants you to hear. \u201cRule No. 1, breathe.

People are going to tell you that you\u2019re perfect just the way you are. You\u2019re not. [pause for laughter] You are imperfect. You always will be, but there is a powerful force that designed you that way. And if you\u2019re willing to accept that, you will have grace and grace is a gift. And like the freedom that we enjoy in this country, that grace was paid for by somebody else\u2019s blood and do not forget it. Don\u2019t take it for granted. God bless you\u2026\u201d The crowd stands to their feet in applause as Pratt exits the stage.\n\nPratt\u2019s Christian journey started long ago on the island of Maui, where a street preacher convinced the future Guardians of the Galaxy and Parks and Recreation star that he needed God. At only 19 years old, and after dropping out of Community College in his home state of Washington, he accepted an offer from a friend to live with him on the Valley Island. Chris would spend his days smoking weed and drinking, followed by bunking up in a tent on a beach or his buddy\u2019s van if there was room.\n\nHe was working just enough to get by as a server at the prestigious Bubba Gump, Maui. When one day a street preacher walked up to Pratt and his friends and asked: \u201cWhat are you doing tonight?\u201d Chris alluded to an unruly night of doing what they do best; drugs, alcohol and hopefully bunking up with a lady friend. The preacher invited the group to his church service as an alternate plan. Ditching his friends that night, Pratt became a Christian two days later.\n\nPratt is now a regular attendee of LA\u2019s Zoe Church along several other A-List Celebrities. Zoe is similar in popularity to megachurches Hillsong & PlanetShakers, all of which could fall into a category vastly different from what non-church people would consider religious services.\n\nComing from a background where church almost seemed like it was supposed to be painful, I can see why millennials and Gen Z\u2019ers are opting out of the whole \u2018religion thing.\u2019 As a man who\u2019s attended Catholic Mass, I can say that my way knowing that church is working, is that you should feel some level of boredom throughout the service.\n\nI USED TO FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT MY FAITH UNTIL THIS AMAZING THING HAPPENED\n\nI can\u2019t say that being forced to go to Mass was a great experience in my history of faith, and I\u2019m definitely not alone when it comes to the countless millennials who grew up in their parent\u2019s church or private schooling, only to slip out the second they\u2019re outside their mother\u2019s grasp. What Calvary, Hillsong and other modern churches are doing to attract millennials and celebrities is an incredible transformation of preaching and entertainment. Millennial-based churches are turning religion into a relationship, with the goal of bringing in anyone willing to listen closer to God, and isn\u2019t that what church is supposed to be doing?\n\n\"We don't use the word 'religion,' because it's hard to get people excited about religion,\" Carl Lentz, 35, the pastor of Hillsong told the NY Daily News. \"Religion is dead. I don't know anything about religion, I couldn't help you. Religion has no power. But a relationship with God is a superpower.\"\n\nWith a growing demand for life-altering faith-based content, these churches are conducting as many as six services each and every Sunday to audiences in the tens of thousands. The services aren\u2019t in your traditional \u2018priest in a pulpit\u2019 format and the multimedia production rivals that of any Hollywood Studio. These services are extending even further beyond their live audiences with Hillsong alone producing music videos, daily messages and the like through their social media channels. Broadcasting to an exponentially larger audience around the globe. It\u2019s the powerful message in a cool atmosphere that keeps the kids coming back. Much like the law of attraction, cool things attract cool people. Cool people like Justin Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Selena Gomez, Kevin Durant, Nick Jonas and Bono.\n\nBieber\u2019s trials and tribulations have been well documented to say the least, but just to recap, 2014 was a big year for Justin\u2026 And not in the good way. Drugs, excessive drinking, trying to illegally import a pet monkey, spending a night in jail for underage drag racing\u2026 You know, normal stuff for a 20-year-old Canadian multi-millionaire. It wasn\u2019t until Hillsong\u2019s pastor, Carl Lentz entered the picture that Justin was able to turn his life and image around for the better. According to GQ, Bieber had a true coming to Jesus moment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter looking in the mirror, he was ravaged by feelings of loss and fell to his knees, crying \u201cI want to know Jesus.\u201d Praying with Pastor Carl and overcome by the gospel, he said: \u201cBaptize me.\u201d After numerous failed attempts to find a private body of water to conduct a proper baptism, they ended up in Tyson Chandler\u2019s (formally on the New York Knicks) bathroom, conducting the ceremony in Tyson\u2019s oversized bathtub (he\u2019s over 7 feet tall). The spiritual rebirth since carried over to the digital world through Christian messaging and support for his home church, Hillsong, throughout social media. What once included lyrics that any evangelical would frown upon, he now posts cover\u2019s from Hillsong\u2019s home band\u2019s music.\n\nFrom Bieber to Snoop Dog. Snoop Dog may be one of the greatest rappers of our generation. What he\u2019s not known for is Gospel music. Well, that was until March of 2018 when his Snoop Dog Presents: Bible of Love hit No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Top Gospel Albums Chart. Not to be outdone, Kanye West is rumored to be producing a Gospel album of his own.\n\nAfter posting a TMZ Live, 112 crooner Slim hinted that Kanye West could soon be dropping some new music with a totally different vibe. In his video, he strongly hinted at a Christian music collaboration between 112 and Yeezy himself. Recently, his tweets even allude to using apps to read the BIBLE and PRAY. Regardless of his previous shenanigans, I\u2019m confident that the musical genius will be able to pull some more fire from his brain.\n\nThe demand for faith-based content is catching the attention of more than just A-List celebrities and musicians alike, with Hollywood Studios vying for underserved and discerning faith-based audiences. Such effort produced multiple surprise hits such as \u201cHeaven Is for Real\u201d and \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead.\u201d Given their popularity, the rate of faith-based films released in theaters annually has doubled since 2012, to about 12 a year. Still, the undefeated heavyweight in this category is Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cPassion of the Christ,\u201d which set the bar for religious-based films, grossing $611 million worldwide off of a $30 million budget.\n\nMainstream media and celebrities are starting to talk about their faith, more faith-based content is being produced than ever before, rappers known for their hardcore gangster lyrics are turning to Gospel music and these mega-churches are taking a step back from traditional religious services in order to elicit a positive experience for younger generations. So, what does this all mean and where do we go from here?\n\nOne problem that currently exists is lacking a central platform to organize and deliver this multimedia for audiences who are generally interested in faith-based content but are overwhelmed and don\u2019t want to go to a church IRL (in real life). Digging through social media is like trying to find a diamond in a land-fill. Churches like Hillsong may have great content, but the community experience can\u2019t be replicated online by a single entity, and sometimes people want to get content from other faith leaders\u2026 like Kanye West\u2026 just kidding, like Matt Chandler.\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s ever asked, how can we get more young people to our church, the answer is being paved in stone by organizations like Hillsong & Zoe. In communities like Los Angeles and New York, where faith-based organizations must interact with their congregations on the go, technology is critical. Churches are using platforms like Instagram, Twitch, and pray.com to bring younger people together. And why not? It\u2019s a good experience for everyone, celebrity or not.\n\nYou too can Make Faith Great Again through fun, entertainment and most importantly a relationship with the almighty. God is attracting celebrities, producers and tech entrepreneurs, which in turn is bringing even more young people through the doors of our churches, creating more impact on our community, and strengthening individual\u2019s relationship with the Lord. Which, at the end of the day, is the whole point of sharing our beliefs, don\u2019t you think?"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/isis-nightmare-prompts-some-muslims-in-the-middle-east-to-convert-to-christianity", "text": "Almost five years after ISIS slaughtered its way onto the scene in Iraq and Syria \u2013 brandishing their own extreme and much-denounced version of Islam \u2013 some in the Middle East are coming out to announce their conversion to Christianity, seeking another Abrahamic faith to drown out the nightmares of life under the terrorist tirade.\n\n\u201cOne day, ISIS came to the house as they were unhappy with my mother and my sister. They wanted to take them away and I begged them not too, I said I would do whatever I could to protect them,\u201d Jamial, a 35-year-old Iraqi, who in recent months made a quiet conversion to Christianity, told Fox News. \u201cSo for two years and eight months, we were forced to live under their rule and do what they say.\u201d\n\nJamial was born in the Old City of Mosul. His dad died three years before ISIS overran his beloved city, and he \u2013 as the eldest son \u2013 was left to take care of his mother and two younger siblings, working in a local supermarket to make ends meet. As the battle to reclaim Mosul gathered intensity in the first half of 2017, Jamial left behind all his belongings and fled north to a displacement camp in the Kurdish capital of Erbil.\n\nBut one saving grace, he said, has been turning to Christianity since leaving Mosul \u2013 and doing so in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan, where he feels somewhat safer.\n\n\u201cI know in my heart God will save me,\u201d Jamial said.\n\nISIS TEEN WIFE BEMOANS UK'S 'UNJUST' DECISION TO REVOKE HER CITIZENSHIP\n\nYet the healing process is slow, and the memories still haunt.\n\n\u201cI can never go back to Mosul, there is no civil reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. I have psychological problems and nightmares every night, worrying that ISIS will come back and kill me and take away my mother and my sister because every I worried about that,\u201d Jamial stressed. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t sleep at all.

But I saw all the bloodshed around me, I became sympathetic to what the Christians were experiencing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis sadness touched my heart. I first learned more, then I changed.\u201d\n\nHowever, since the very beginning of the rise of ISIS, Imams, Islamic leaders and scholars across the globe have denounced the extreme ideology and accused the barbaric group of twisting their religion to fit a nefarious agenda.\n\nYet a switch to Christianity often doesn\u2019t come without consequences.\n\nWhile the passage from another faith into Islam is mainstream and widely discussed, conversions from Islam to other faiths are often staunchly prohibited and come with dangerous repercussions and retribution \u2013 meaning most must be kept shrouded in secrecy with names and identities protected.\n\n\u201cApostasy is a capital offense according to traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Those who convert are customarily threatened to death from either sharia-based states, radical mobs and/or their own families,\u201d explained John Eibner, a human rights advocate and the CEO of Christian Solidarity International-USA. \u201cThose who convert are sometimes secretly baptized, usually after a long, secret period of reflection and instruction in the faith. But it is dangerous, and those involved must exercise great discretion.\u201d\n\nANDREW MCCARTHY: WHY IT'S SO HARD TO REVOKE THE CITIZENSHIP OF TERRORISTS\n\nSam said that every day he still feels paralyzed with fear.\n\n\u201cI was afraid; I am still afraid,\" he said. \"My old friends do not communicate with me any longer and my parents have left me on my own. I mostly befriend other Christians but some of them do not believe I have converted completely. They think I could be a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\n\n\u201cThey ask why a Muslim would convert? I do not have an answer. I tell them God works in mysterious ways. But even if my friends and family have turned against me, it is like one chapter is done and the next page is turning.\u201d\n\nEven before ISIS, some in the Middle East said they made a move cloaked in both fear and anticipation.\n\nAzad Barwari, a pastor at Magnolia Baptist Church in Anaheim, California \u2013 specializing in ministry to Muslim refugees \u2013 said he converted in the year 2000 while living in the Kurdish city of Zakho near the Turkish border.\n\n\u201cAs a result of my conversion out of Islam, I was persecuted by my family so I fled Iraq and lived in Lebanon for several years where I was imprisoned and tortured,\u201d Barwari claimed. \u201cI came to the USA in 2009 as a religious refugee.\u201d\n\nWHY I LEFT ISIS: FORMER BAGHDADI 'FRIEND' AND AIDE, OTHERS SPEAK OUT\n\nHe said that as a result, he has received two death threats in the U.S, which he has reported to authorities, but otherwise refuses to shy away from sharing his thoughts and experiences.\n\n\u201cIn the year 2000, someone gave me the New Testament when I was sitting at a store in Zakho. It was during Ramadan and I was fasting,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe book was in an envelope and I didn\u2019t know it was a Bible. I liked reading and I had a spiritual hunger. This touched my heart, and Christ answered me. We Kurds were living in enmity and I was angry and I need peace.\u201d\n\nChristianity has for decades been dwindling in the Middle East amid a climate of persecution and insecurity, but the ISIS onslaught over four years ago prompted tens of thousands more to flee.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that less than five percent of the Syrian and Iraqi population is Christian, a sharp decline from the roughly ten percent a decade ago.\n\nFor others in the region, the ISIS incursion has not necessarily meant a conversion into another faith, but a deeper reflection and move away from religion altogether.\n\n\u201cWhen ISIS came and the chaos of them kidnapping Yazidi girls and making them sex slaves, and killing anyone who didn\u2019t fit their perspective made me think twice,\u201d one 35-year-old Iraq-based female professional, who can only be identified as Saleema, explained. \u201cI wanted to be free and just be a good person with good manners without following any belief. Now, I don\u2019t follow any religion.

That\u2019s ironic considering the debate which now simmers over whether President Trump overstepped presidential authority to redistribute money for his border wall. This is especially prescient considering how lawmakers guard Congressional prerogatives. Ceding power of the purse to the executive establishes a new precedent in American government. This is precisely the concern Washington raised when he spoke of \u201cencroachment\u201d and limiting power within \u201cconstitutional spheres.\u201d\n\nTRUMP NEEDS A TRANSFER, MAY HAVE TO ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL\n\nPolicymakers always have exercised a healthy tension between the legislative branch and the executive branch. But none other than Alexander Hamilton called for what he characterized as \u201cenergy\u201d in the executive when writing Federalist #70, the precursor set of documents which helped form the Constitution.\n\nHamilton demanded an active executive to curb legislative overreaches and to pose as a bulwark against Congress. In this instance, Trump asserts there\u2019s an emergency at the border. So he needs the wall. Maybe. Maybe not. But this is why the founders formed a system of checks and balances. There\u2019s a question about just how much latitude the president has when it comes to repurposing funds Congress designated for something else. The Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power of the purse. All presidents can do is either sign or veto bills after lawmakers decide to spend money. Trump\u2019s plan to rejigger billions of dollars of already appropriated spending by Congress could be a problem.\n\nPresidents long have tested the parameters of executive authority. President Woodrow Wilson declared a \u201cnational emergency\u201d in 1917 because of an \u201cinsufficiency of maritime tonnage\u201d to carry U.S. agricultural and manufacturing commodities. Congress approved the National Emergencies Act of 1976, granting presidents the ability to act on any number of priorities they may deem an emergency. Presidents have declared 58 national emergencies since 1976. Thirty-one are renewed each year.\n\nFrom a parliamentary perspective, Fox News is told that the National Emergencies Act is a legislative mess. It lacks focus, specificity and is inherently vague.\n\n\u201cIt is not the gold standard for writing legislation,\u201d confided one source.\n\nThat said, Congress can terminate declarations of national emergencies with the adoption of a joint resolution by both bodies of Congress. It needs a simple majority and must earn a presidential signature. If the president vetoes a House/Senate joint resolution, those bodies can move to override the veto with a two-thirds vote.\n\nThe House likely would seek action to revoke the national emergency as it pertains to the wall. But this process is far thornier in the Senate. The statute contains imprecise verbiage as to how the Senate may consider the legislation and whether certain, special procedural motions fly in the face of debating the statute. For instance, the law requires the Senate to vote on overturning the national emergency after \u201cthree days.\u201d But what constitutes \u201cthree days?\u201d Three full days of debate? A motion to adjourn is one of the most-privileged motions in the Senate. What happens if the Senate were to adjourn without first finishing work to repeal the national emergency?\n\nCAPITOL GRAPPLES WITH COMPLICATED HISTORY ON RACE\n\nAs one source said to Fox News, \u201cIf (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell doesn\u2019t want the resolution to come up, it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen rushing to the Senate floor to announce that Trump would sign the spending package last week, McConnell also declared he was on board with the national emergency. A few weeks ago, McConnell\u2019s position on Congressional action to rebuke a national emergency was hazier. But McConnell\u2019s position grew definitive when asked by Fox News about Trump using executive authority to mine appropriations bills for wall funding.\n\n\u201cHe ought to feel free to use whatever tools he wants to use to secure the border. I would not be troubled by that,\u201d replied McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nDemocrats are apoplectic that Trump would go to such lengths to bypass Congress. Many Republicans are, too. That\u2019s why a Senate vote to reverse the national emergency could prove so interesting. Some Senate Republicans also have shown a willingness to buck Trump when it comes to foreign policy. Some Republicans have broken with the administration over an early withdrawal from Syria, relaxing of U.S. sanctions on Russia and how the president dealt with Saudi Arabia following the death of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe other problem staring at the Trump administration is the \u201cYoungstown Steel Case.\u201d The 1952 Supreme Court case Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer is thought to be the most consequential rebuff of presidential powers in history. In fact during his confirmation hearing, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh cited the case as one of the most important rulings ever handed down by the High Court. It\u2019s possible Trump could face a dim view on his expansion of appropriation powers at the Supreme Court. Moreover, it will be interesting to see how Kavanaugh interprets the president\u2019s maneuver, considering his testimony about \u201cYoungstown Steel\u201d last year.\n\nThe question on the table is why Congress should exist if the president is able to trample on legislative spending authority.\n\nThe late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., long worried about what would happen to Congress if it forked over powers to the executive branch. Byrd cited the decline of the Roman Senate once the executive seized the power of the purse.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe United States Senate would have set its foot on the same road to decline, subservience, impotence and feebleness that the Roman Senate followed in its own descent into ignominy, cowardice and oblivion,\u201d warned Byrd.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to study the Romans.

Compare that to the only nine percent of boomers who responded the same.\n\nInterestingly, nearly one in three millennials feel they will actually never be able to afford a down payment, and 27 percent say the only way they will ever home is through inheritance. The home market seems to be shifting in a way that is preventing millennials from achieving their home-owning dreams.\n\nNearly half of millennials (47 percent) believe that buying a home now is a lot more difficult than it was thirty years ago.\n\nAnd they aren\u2019t the only ones that think so -- over half of boomers (51 percent) feel the same way, with one in four saying they \u201cstrongly\u201d believe so.\n\nSaid Thomas Sponholtz, Unison CEO: \u201cMillennials are very cynical, more so than their boomer counterparts, when it comes to home buying and are concerned about piling on additional debt. They want flexibility and control of their life and their finances. When they partner with Unison, who will contribute up to 15% of the down payment, millennials have the ability to buy a home, while still having cash on hand to live the life they want.\u201d\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just the housing market that\u2019s gotten worse -- at least according to millennials.\n\nAccording to the data, only eight percent of millennial respondents disagree that life is harder in general now than it was when baby boomers were their age.\n\nAnd it\u2019s having a detrimental effect on their mentality, as over twice as many millennials feel they will never achieve their dreams than baby boomers.\n\nWhen it comes to jobs it\u2019s the same story.\n\nThe survey asked respondents if they\u2019d ever had trouble just finding a job and found that 26 percent of baby boomers said they had. When it comes to millennials, that number doubled (49 percent).\n\nThe ability to not afford a down payment on a home has altered quite a bit of millennials\u2019 trajectory, too.\n\nFor example, one in three millennials say they\u2019ve changed their life plan due to not being able to afford a down payment on a home, and another 22 percent put off getting married for the same reason.\n\nOne in four (24 percent) have actually put off having kids. Only 5 percent of boomers could say they\u2019ve ever done the same.\n\n\u201cWith student debt and rising home prices, millennials have it harder than their baby boomer counterparts did at the same age,\u201d continued Sponholtz. \u201cOwning a home is a fundamental human desire and they might be willing to give up their iPhone, brunch, and marriage to own a home, but with Unison they don\u2019t have to; instead, they can own the home, instead of the home owning them.\u201d\n\nWHAT WOULD MILLENNIALS DO FOR THEIR \u2018DREAM HOME?\u2019\n\nI would give up my iPhone forever 29%\n\nI would never post on Instagram again 47%\n\nI would give up Chipotle forever 48%\n\nI would never eat avocado toast again 39%\n\nI would break up with my partner 9%\n\nI would have gone to Fyre Fest 23%\n\nI would go to jail for a week 25%\n\nI would listen to 'Cotton Eye Joe' for a week straight 42%\n\nI would survive in the wild for a week 28%\n\nI would give up sex for five years 16%\n\nI would give up sex for ten years 13%\n\nI would give up brunch forever 36%\n\nI would run a marathon 38%"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/auto/honda-ridgeline-recalled-for-fire-risk-caused-by-car-wash-soap", "text": "Honda is recalling 106,683 Ridgeline pickups in the United States, because they could catch fire after being cleaned.\n\nThe issue stems from the Ridgeline's fuel pump feed port, which can be corroded over time by the kinds of acids found in some car wash soaps, leading to cracks that may allow gas to leak out.\n\nOwners of the 2017 to 2019 vehicles will be notified and Honda will inspect and, if necessary, replace the fuel pumps and also install a new fuel pump cover.\n\nHONDA RIDGELINE TEST DRIVE\n\nHonda has not advised owners to refrain from driving or washing their vehicles.\n\nThe recall is scheduled to being March 7.\n\nHonda is also recalling approximate 437,000 vehicles across several other model lines for an unrelated fuel pump issue caused by sodium particulates in gasoline sticking to internal components that could lead to stalling.

Yet the souls of the damned sit there starving, as they have spoons that can reach into the pot -- but can\u2019t reach the food.\n\nWhile New York sits atop the Marcellus Shale, with more than 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which equates to more than 85 billion barrels of oil, the state is facing rapidly rising natural gas prices and spot shortages. Thanks to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s ban on horizontal fracking, instead of a flow of cheap, abundant New York homegrown natural gas, the state now faces rising prices.\n\nInstead of being almost independent on gas, they must pipeline in supply from places as far away as Texas.\n\nDuring the recent polar vortex, New York utilities could not keep the gas on and keep people warm. In a state where they have seen a transition from old-fashioned dirty heating oil, to much cleaner natural gas, the demand is rising faster than supply, freezing out some customers. One state utility, Con Ed, has declared a moratorium on new gas connections and is also raising prices to consumers by a whopping 11 percent in homes that heat with natural gas, and a 6 percent rise for electricity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd adding even more fuel to the fire is the fact that New York is making it almost impossible to increase supply as the Cuomo administration drags its feet or blocks pipelines. Somehow, the safest transit for oil and natural gas pipelines are getting a bad rap, even though almost all of New York City has pipelines, but they still need more.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThe moral of the story is that environmental extremism is costing the state business, as businesses can\u2019t open without natural gas supply and real estate projects get put on hold. This is also costing the state an untold numbers of jobs, not only in the natural gas and utilities business, but all businesses that can\u2019t operate in the state because of a shortage of natural gas supply.\n\nIf this is the damage that environmental extremism can do in just New York, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, D-N.Y., proposed Green New Deal would surely cause the rest of the country everlasting economic pain.

Congress tasked the central bank in 1977 with promoting \u201cmaximum employment, production and purchasing power\u201d by keeping the cost of goods stable and creating solid labor-market conditions.\n\nOne of the most potent tools in the Fed\u2019s arsenal includes interest rates.\n\nTypically, when policymakers are trying to spur additional consumer spending, they lower interest rates to reduce the cost of borrowing (during the financial recession in 2008, for instance, the Fed lowered it to effectively zero and did not raise it again until 2015). Conversely, to avoid inflation and cool the economy, it will raise rates to make it more expensive to borrow.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nGenerally, the Fed tries to maintain a federal funds rate between 2 percent and 5 percent.

A scathing report by the National Taxpayer Advocate describes a backlog of 5 million unsorted mail pieces, as few were on call to sort mail received during the federal shutdown.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nTaxpayers will likely swarm the phone lines as April draws closer, since an astounding 93.3 percent of callers trying to pay over the phone during the shutdown were unable to contact a live agent. But there remains a bright spot throughout this entire frustrating process: e-filing.\n\nFiling taxes online has soared in popularity over the past decade; the percentage of returns being logged online went from less than 70 percent in 2010 to more than 90 percent today. Going online to file taxes is an easy and efficient alternative to high postage prices and long waiting times.\n\nWhile this shift in filing benefits taxpayers and the IRS, the trend highlights a growing problem at another beleaguered agency: the United States Postal Service (USPS). Without greater coordination and adaptability between the IRS and USPS, both agencies will suffer key setbacks to the detriment of taxpayers across the country.\n\nThis predicament facing the USPS highlights a larger issue with declining mail delivery and corresponding revenue. Five year mail revenue is down by more than $3 billion. This is largely due to technological change beyond the USPS\u2019s control, but the agency certainly isn\u2019t helping out matters on their end. The service does report on-time percentages for different mail categories, but the results are disappointing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree-to-five-day first-class mail is on time less than 90 percent of the time (as of fiscal year 2018). And, an inspector general (IG) report in 2017 found that the USPS understated delayed mail by 2 billion pieces. Even these figures are not trustworthy.\n\nIn the spring 2018 semiannual report to Congress, USPS acting inspector general (IG) Tammy Whitcomb offered a disappointing take on USPS management, efficiency, and performance. According to the IG, big picture consumer survey results are certainly not encouraging, with three-year declines in \u201crecent USPS delivery performance,\u201d \u201cdelivery accuracy,\u201d \u201ctracking information accuracy,\u201d and \u201ccarrier friendliness and courtesy.\u201d Even if a tax-filing consumer doesn\u2019t have to deal with a carrier, the act of fending for oneself at the post office can prove daunting. Self-service kiosks are only available in about a tenth of all Post Office locations, and glitches and out-of-order signs often make clerks the only option.\n\nThese frustrating experiences either leave filers to e-file, or simply procrastinate that dreaded post office trip until the last possible minute. And at a time when the IRS\u2019s mail backlog is already in the thousands of pieces, this last-minute frenzy only adds to the chaos.\n\nThe USPS can take steps to make life easier for taxpayers and the IRS - but these changes would require significantly more discipline on the part of postal leadership.

In the next few months, those visiting Santa Rosalia will see a border gate. Last year, Customs and Border Protection awarded a contract for border wall gate construction in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. The project relies on CBP\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017 appropriation.\n\nJ.J. Gonzalez, whose grandmother is buried at the cemetery, believes the border gate will deter potential visitors to a cemetery already suffering from neglect.\n\n\u201cPeople I\u2019ve spoken to, they saw the wall, and they think they can no longer come back here, they think we\u2019re in Mexico, and we\u2019re still in the United States,\u201d said Gonzalez.\n\nGonzalez said he discovered the gravesite a year and a half ago when he was searching for his grandmother\u2019s headstone. He found it amid an overgrowth of weeds.\n\n\u201cLater, I find out that I have great, great grandfathers, great grandfather, so I clean up their graves. But, as I would come visit, I said it wasn\u2019t right that only their graves were clean and the others were neglected,\u201d said Gonzalez.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd, so began a mission to clean the enire cemetery. He and a handful of volunteers formed the Santa Rosalia Cemetery Preservation Society last year. They took the responsibility of maintaining the property and, in the process, found nearly two dozen veterans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sad to me. Anyone here, just the fact that they\u2019re forgotten,\u201d said Gonzalez.\n\nThe cemetery dates back to the 19th century and once served a long-gone ranching community by the U.S.-Mexico border. There were once dozens of ranches throughout Cameron County.\n\n\u201cThis was an agricultural economy, and so you had all the farms that were out on this range. Each farm had its own cemetery,\u201d said Eugene Fernandez, a commissioner with the Cameron County Historical Commission.\n\nAs families left, memories of the place began to fade.\n\n\u201cPeople move on and forget about it. That is the factor that is important in the equation,\u201d said Fernandez.\n\nBut Fernandez disagrees the border gate will prevent people from visiting the cemetery.\n\n\u201cEven if a Border Patrol person sees you, they\u2019ll ask you what\u2019s your mission here? And you say, 'well I\u2019m coming to see my grandmother,' and they\u2019ll cut the conversation loose from then on,\u201d said Fernandez.\n\nAS BORDER WALL FUNDING DIVIDES WASHINGTON, NEW MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BARRIER WILL SOON BREAK GROUND IN TEXAS\n\nCBP has said it is willing to work with residents to make sure they have needed access. Gonzalez said he is still worried the gate would discourage people from visiting.\n\n\u201cIf the gate goes up, people will stop because they won\u2019t know they can drive down the levee,\u201d said Gonzalez.\n\nBecause the cemetery is deemed private property, the city isn\u2019t obligated to take care of it. Fernandez said that\u2019s why private associations, like the one Gonzalez started, are crucial in making sure it is maintained.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why J.J,\u2019s mission right there has a wonderful place in my heart,\u201d said Fernandez.\n\nWith six family members buried in Santa Rosalia, Gonzalez says he\u2019s not going anywhere. Duty calls.\n\n\u201cI was taught\u2026that we have to respect and always remember our ancestors.

Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan to impose a new tax on the nation\u2019s richest citizens has broad public support, but implementing such a measure would come with a host of difficulties that could blunt the expected benefits and send wealthy individuals scrambling to rearrange their assets.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAnd in some cases even taking extreme steps to avoid the tax all together.\n\nAccording to a recent Fox News poll, 70 percent of voters support the proposal by Warren \u2013 a Massachusetts Democrat who is seeking the party\u2019s nomination in the 2020 presidential election \u2013 to impose a 2 percent tax on those who have over $50 million in assets in a given year.\n\nBut determining who falls within that threshold is a monumental undertaking, involving changes to already complex tax policy that could further encourage the rich to seek new strategies to avoid the higher burden and ensnare the Internal Revenue Service in even more legal challenges. It\u2019s one reason why eight of the 12 countries abandoned their own wealth tax, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation\u2019s Nicole Kaeding.\n\nWealth taxes \u201care difficult taxes to administer and that\u2019s because the uber wealthy tend to have assets that are very difficult to value,\u201d she told FOX Business. \u201cIt would add a lot of compliance costs to the IRS, they would have to beef up their enforcement and auditing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the strategies that the ultra-rich may employ is shifting wealth into closely held stocks, artwork and other collectible items that can be difficult to value, pooling assets among trusted associates and divesting money into third-party insurance policies, tactics the IRS is already intimately familiar with.\n\nThe agency currently evaluates an individual\u2019s assets when calculating the estate tax. But the process is difficult and can lead to legal disputes between the family of the deceased and the IRS that take years to resolve.\n\nMany assets, like real estate or businesses, fluctuate year by year, sometimes even daily in the case of stock ownership. And imposing a set threshold \u2013 in this case, $50 million \u2013 would almost certainly encourage the wealthy to, among the other tactics, try to redistribute assets to siblings, children or spouses in an attempt to avoid the tax.\n\n\u201cThe real enforcement challenges occur during taxpayers lives when they find ways to shift assets out of their estate\u2026and reduce the amount of the estate tax,\u201d Joshua Blank, a law professor at the University of California, said. \u201cToday, the best way for the wealthy to avoid tax on their assets is to hold onto them until they die. The Warren proposal would tax the wealthy during life.\"\n\nTo help remedy this, Warren is proposing \u201ca significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget.\u201d The plan also calls for a minimum audit rate for the wealthy \u2013 a measure that would hike the agency\u2019s litigation costs, according to Moritz College of Law\u2019s Stephanie Hoffer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that they anticipate people trying to minimize the liability, perhaps in creative ways,\u201d she told FOX Business.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 25672.36 -290.15 -1.12% I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 7739.89551 -99.06 -1.26% SP500 S&P 500 2823.59 -31.29 -1.10%\n\nAnother significant question is how the proposal would address pass-through businesses, or those companies that are structured in a way that profits flow through to the owner who is then taxed at an individual rate. Executives of such entities could theoretically be worth millions \u2013 given their overall wealth is tied to the valuation of the firm -- but only command a sliver of that as take-home income.\n\nWarren\u2019s proposal would allow individuals with \u201cextremely high net worth but liquidity constraints\u201d to defer tax payments for up to five years with interest.\n\nDespite the challenges, however, experts say the plan is feasible.\n\n\u201cFrom the broad contours of this, we can safely say that there\u2019d be valuation issues, there\u2019d be tax avoidance and evasion issues. But that\u2019s not to say that this is impossible,\u201d said Leandra Lederman, a tax professor at Indiana University.\n\nGiven the potential challenges around implementation, there are also questions around exactly how much revenue such a plan would generate.\n\nWarren says it could net the federal government an added $2.7 trillion over a decade, money that would be used to fund initiatives like universal child care. That includes the expectation that at least 15 percent of filers would successfully engage in tax avoidance measures, but some experts say it could be even higher.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s currently the amount the federal government loses under the income tax, which is a much easier tax to administer,\u201d the Tax Foundation's Kaeding said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nRevenue from tax reform is also hotly debated and is often influenced by one\u2019s ideological view.

I met the love of my life. And we got hitched! My heart is full. Thank you Brendan Mcloughlin for loving me for.... me.\"\n\nIt's unclear how long the couple have been dating, as the Pistol Annies singer only split from boyfriend Evan Felker in August 2018. Before that, she'd rebounded from ex-husband Blake Shelton, to whom she was married for four years and together for 10, with rocker Anderson East. Lambert and East split in April 2018.\n\nMIRANDA LAMBERT'S AMAZING BODY TRANSFORMATION\n\nIn any case, Lambert, 35, and McLoughlin, 27, were photographed looking as in love as ever walking hand-in-hand in Times Square on Saturday, with spies telling People, \u201cThey looked happy and natural holding hands strolling sidewalk. She was beaming and protectively holding her ring finger. They looked like a couple going on a date in the city.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHere, get to know Lambert's latest love (and handy distraction from salad-flipping tantrums), with six facts about Brendan McLoughlin.\n\n1. He's an NYPD officer.\n\nMiranda Lambert's new man is a boy in blue! Brendan McLoughlin is a New York City police officer in the Midtown South precinct. He's originally from Staten Island, N.Y.\n\n2. He once caught a bank robber.\n\nIt looks like Brendan McLoughlin is great at his job! The NYPD Midtown South precinct congratulated him and a colleague on a job well done in March 2018, writing, \"This week these fine officers showed what we do best in #Midtown. PO McLoughlin apprehended perpetrator in a bank robbery in progress & PO Donato had a pick up arrest of a truck burglary closing out several open complaints.\"\n\n3. He tried his hand at modeling.\n\nMiranda Lambert's ex-husband, Blake Shelton, may have been named Sexiest Man Alive in 2017, but Brendan McLoughlin actually was a model. In 2011, when McLoughlin was just 19 years old, he posed in shirtless snaps for a Model Mayhem page, in which he also specified his measurements: The hunk is 5'11,\" 150 pounds and, importantly, refused to pose nude. He wrote of his style as being \"all american boy/ abercrombie / sporty,\" but added, \"I'm open minded, so feel free to network with me, share your ideas, and organize sessions.\"\n\n4. He's younger than his bride.\n\nBrendan McLoughlin is 27 to Miranda Lambert's 35, making him the youngest man with whom she's been publicly linked \u2014 though she's had a bit of a cougar pattern since her divorce from Blake Shelton. Evan Felker is a year younger at 34, while Anderson East turned 30 after a few months after he and Lambert split in 2018.\n\n5. He's a dog person.\n\nGood news for Miranda Lambert, who has a ton of rescue pooches: Brendan McLoughlin loves dogs almost as much as she does! He's been photographed with adorable NYPD K-9s at events, which probably helped to melt her heart.\n\n6. He's athletic.\n\nIn case his shirtless pics didn't convince you, Brendan McLoughlin is as in shape as they come.

The journalist was released Sept. 23, 2014.\n\nWhile the journalist is not named in the complaint or in a superseding indictment, the dates of his capture and release, and several details outlined in the court documents, match the experiences of author Michael Scott Moore, a German-American who was abducted by pirates in Somalia while he was there writing a book about piracy.\n\nMoore's publicist said he was unreachable for an interview Thursday. In November, Moore confirmed to the New York Times that another man indicted in the case, Mohamed Tahlil Mohamed, was one of his captors. Mohamed and Hassan are listed as co-defendants.\n\nAccording to court documents, Hassan, 51, was born in Mogadishu and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He faces six counts, including kidnapping conspiracy, hostage-taking conspiracy and unlawful use of firearms.\n\nHe was arrested in Minneapolis on Friday and will be returned to New York to face charges. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney in New York to comment on his behalf.\n\nThe charging documents say the journalist was in a vehicle on Jan. 21, 2012, in the vicinity of Galkayo when he was surrounded by a group of heavily armed men carrying what appeared to be AK-47 assault rifles and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. He was abducted and struck with weapons, injuring his head and wrist.\n\nHe was taken to different areas in Somalia, and at one point was held in a vessel off the Somali coast. He told investigators that he and another hostage were typically guarded by about 10 men, all armed with assault rifles or belt-fed machine guns. In December 2013, he was moved to a residence near Galkayo, which was frequently visited by Hassan, the complaint says.\n\nThe complaint says Hassan spoke English and was a translator for the hostage takers; the journalist, who identified Hassan from a lineup, said he also appeared to hold a leadership position over the other guards.\n\nMultiple times during the journalist's captivity, Hassan ordered him to call a family member to try to demand more money for ransom. During one call on Jan. 30, 2012, the journalist told a family member that his captors were demanding $20 million \"and that if they did not receive the money within 24 hours, they would stop providing food and water to Victim-1,\" the complaint said.\n\nIn another call in May 2012, the journalist said things had \"gotten very serious\" and another hostage had been tortured in front of him. The journalist said there was a real threat that if the ransom didn't come through, he would be sold to al-Shabab.\n\nIn May 2012, the pirates released a video, showing the journalist in an undisclosed location with a prayer shawl over his head, surrounded by masked kidnappers who pointed a machine gun and rocket-propelled grenade at him.\n\nThe journalist was released in September 2014. Moore has said his family raised $1.6 million for his release.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Hassan entered the U.S. in New York on Sept. 15, 2015, and was interviewed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He allegedly said he worked as the Minister of the Interior and Security for Galmudug State in Somalia, which includes Galkayo, and his job included arranging for the release of kidnapped people, including the journalist.\n\n___\n\nFollow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/document-man-accused-of-attacking-officer-asked-to-be-shot", "text": "An Islamic State follower asked a Phoenix-area sheriff's sergeant during a violent encounter six weeks ago to shoot him after he threw rocks at the officer and walked toward him with a knife in hand, according to a court document authorities were forced to release Wednesday.\n\nThe probable-cause statement from the investigation of Ismail Hamed was released after The Associated Press and other news organizations protested an effort by Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery's office to keep videos and other records from the Jan. 7 attack under seal.

I'm attempting to learn the banjo\n\nI\u2019m not the most musically-gifted person, but I started learning the guitar in high school. I always wanted to learn the banjo because I love country music, so I started saving up, drove to Old Town School of Folk Music when I was living in Chicago, and bought a banjo. I spent HOURS picking it out, but finally found the one. I try to practice as much as possible, so if you\u2019re my neighbor, I apologize!\n\n2. I\u2019m old-fashioned.\n\nI prefer a handwritten note over a present, I think it\u2019s important to write \"Thank You\" notes, I still read books, but refuse to use a Kindle, I own a typewriter, and I LOVE nature, so I grew up camping.\n\nI spent part of my childhood in Utah, so we went mountain biking, camping and hiking as a family pretty frequently. I distinctly remember bringing balsa wood and a pocket knife, so we could carve while we were camping.\n\nI think my fondness for being outdoors is one of the reasons I\u2019m a huge adrenaline junkie. I\u2019ve been skydiving twice, bungee jumping, and I love rollercoasters and heights!\n\n3. I\u2019ve been playing sports since I could walk.\n\nI trained at two of the three Olympic Training Centers for volleyball, then went on to play sand volleyball at USC.\n\nIn my free time, I love to do basketball trick shots and go to \"Dave & Busters\" to play Pop-a-Shot.\n\n4. My family is the most important thing in my life\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be anywhere without the support of my parents and two brothers.\n\nMy parents have been married for 32 years (33 in June) and are a couple to look up to. One of my brothers, Ryan, attended Notre Dame, while my other brother, Tyler, and I went to USC, so there\u2019s a huge football rivalry in the family!\n\nWe are extremely close and do a lot of things together.\n\n5. My favorite store is Home Depot.\n\nYou can always find me in the PVC pipe aisle. There are so many things you can make. My go-to is a marshmallow launcher.

I\u2019ve been to almost every state in the U.S.\n\nAs Fox News viewers know, I've traveled across the country for \"Watters' World\" segments over the years.

Early-morning workouts, organizing full-court games and spending summers at camps, I loved basketball. (I once also made 230 free throws in a row in the driveway. I only missed one after stopping to get a drink of water).\n\nI led my high school team to the Minnesota state tournament, and set the school record for career three-pointers. My younger brother later broke my record (but only because they ran a run-and-gun offense!).\n\nI went on to play four years at Princeton University. I didn't play much, but I did get on the floor in an NCAA Tournament game in 2001. We were a 15-seed and lost to the #2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels.\n\nI committed a foul in the last minute of the game, so my name is in the official scorebook.\n\n2) My tattoos honor the United States and our military.\n\nI wanted a tattoo for years and got my first one in 2017. That one is a secret, but I quickly added four more, expressing my love of faith, country and service and I'm not done yet!\n\nOne depicts the coat of arms of the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, the Army unit in which I served. Another says \"We the People.\"\n\nTake a look...\n\n3) I wrote a book in 2016, and shockingly, wrote all 304 pages myself!\n\nFollowing my deployments to Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan -- and after extensive time in Washington, D.C., advocating success in the Iraq War and fixing the Department of Veterans Affairs -- I felt like I might have something to say. So, I wrote a book. It took me about six months in 2015, as I worked on it mostly from 4am to 8am each day before going to work. I wrote it as a call-to-arms to reignite American citizenship at home and restore American power abroad, using Teddy Roosevelt's famous \"Man in the Arena\" speech as inspiration.\n\nIn order to save America for the next generation, I believe we need to raise gritty kids who love their country and are willing to fight for what they believe in. I was not originally a Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign (initially I was for Marco Rubio, and then Ted Cruz), but the book hits on many of the same themes as our current President. It's no surprise, therefore, that I want to Make America Great Again.\n\n4) I love to travel to Israel.\n\nIn the past few years, I have had the opportunity -- and honor -- to travel to Israel four times. Each time, my connection to the Jewish State and the holy city of Jerusalem deepened. The history, the religious significance, the conflict and the gravity of Israel are like nowhere else in the world. The United States has long had a special bond with the State of Israel and I hope to help continue that, with a recognition that Israel is, in many ways, the furthest-most outpost of Western civilization.\n\nIsrael is surrounded by countries and terrorist groups that want to wipe it off the map. Not only has it survived, but it has triumphed and thrived, a testament to the fortitude of God's chosen people. I plan to visit Israel as much as I can in the future, hopefully with my kids and family. If you haven't been to Jerusalem, you have to go!\n\nP.S. - I recently conducted a sit-down interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for Fox Nation!

I mean, what's better than fun, friendly, family competition, copious amounts of lemonade and beer (for the adults) and bowling alley pizza?!\n\nI used to think bowling was only for birthday parties and special occasions, but now it's a regular activity. Not all of my kids like bowling as much as I do, though I'm working on them with the fire of a Baptist preacher. I bowl a lot, but I'm still proud when I crack 100. The only thing I've mastered about bowling is the art of the celebration! If you're ever bowling in Minnesota, New Jersey or New York, don't be surprised if you see me and my family in a lane near you.\n\n5 Things You Didn't Know About...\n\nTyrus\n\nBritt McHenry\n\nTrish Regan\n\nAinsley Earhardt\n\nTomi Lahren"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/11/19/tyrus-5-things-you-didnt-know-about-fox-nation-host-greg-gutfeld-show-favorite", "text": "Fox News Insider caught up with Tyrus, the \"Greg Gutfeld Show\" fan-favorite who will be one of the stars of Fox Nation.\n\nThe subscription-based streaming service debuts on November 27, featuring daily shows like \"UN-PC,\" which Tyrus will host each day at 6:00pm ET alongside Britt McHenry.\n\nRead on to find out more about Tyrus and learn more about becoming a Fox Nation founding member.\n\n1. Tyrus played college football at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, later trying out for the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills and the CFL's Toronto Argonauts.\n\nHe went on to play arena football for a couple years and once ruptured his appendix while playing for the Charleston Swamp Foxes.\n\n2. Tyrus was once a bodyguard for Snoop Dogg.\n\nHe got the gig after Snoop's bodyguard witnessed him deftly deal with an unruly patron while he was working security at a Los Angeles club.\n\nHe and Snoop bonded over their shared love of football, and Tyrus started coaching in Snoop's youth football league.\n\n\"Snoop's a pretty basic guy,\" Tyrus said. \"He's a very humble dude. He's not stuck on himself. That's one thing I love about Snoop. He's a real dude.\"\n\n3. Tyrus worked for years as a professional wrestler and performed around the world. He may be familiar to WWE fans because of his Brodus Clay persona.\n\nHe was discovered by WWE's head of talent during a chance encounter at the Los Angeles club where he worked during the weekend of WrestleMania XX in 2004.\n\nHe said his favorite part of pro wrestling was \"stealing the crowd\" and making them a part of the show.\n\nTyrus once gifted Kat Timpf with his action figure for her birthday on a recent \"Gutfeld Show.\"\n\n4. Tyrus and Greg Gutfeld first connected on Twitter.\n\n\"It's an old love story,\" Tyrus joked, revealing that he liked several of Gutfeld's tweets, which led to them following each other.\n\nThey started communicating and Gutfeld eventually invited Tyrus to come on the show as a guest.\n\n5. Tyrus went viral a few years ago for urging compliance with police officers amid Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\"When I'm compliant, nothing bad is going to happen to me. It's not my moment to resist arrest, and when everyone videotapes me resisting arrest and being taken down, that's where bad things happen,\" Tyrus said. \"That doesn't make me Rosa Parks. That makes me a criminal. And it has nothing to do with color.\"\n\nGutfeld suggested that the segment helped the show achieve success, noting that the audience \"doubled in size\" shortly after.\n\nMore 5 Things You Didn't Know...\n\nAinsley Earhardt\n\nBritt McHenry\n\nTrish Regan\n\nTomi Lahren\n\nJudge Jeanine"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/11/07/deirdre-bolton-fox-business-anchor-5-things-you-didnt-know", "text": "Fox News Insider caught up with Fox Business Network's Deirdre Bolton, the host of a brand-new series of FBN specials called \"Women & Money.\"\n\nRead on to find out more about the native Pennsylvanian and don't miss \"Women & Money\" on Fox Business Network.\n\n1. I grew up in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and it is still one of my favorite places to go. I have lived all over the world, but Newtown is still very much \"home\" to me.\n\nWhile I was growing up, working farms were alive and well. I remember my mom and I used to buy milk from one of the local farmers, filling our own glass jugs from the farmer's steel tanks. We paid by leaving cash in a cigar box in the barn.\n\n2. I am happiest outdoors and with animals. I had a big, furry Bernese Mountain Dog as a childhood companion; I still miss her!\n\nNow I live in New York City (thankfully near a park) with my family, including our dog Rocky, a little white poodle mix.\n\n3. When I was a child, I was a competitive swimmer, which is funny because I am not tall but I spent a lot of time in the water from ages 9 to 17.\n\nI grew gills instead of inches. Here I am after winning a race with short swimmers' hair!\n\n(I always cut my hair short after the summer season because the chlorine made my hair so brittle.)\n\n4. I started my professional career on Wall Street, working on an international equities desk. I sold European Equities to American institutional investors for French banks. I liked my job, but I didn't love it. I pitched myself to Bloomberg to write for their magazine. It turned out they needed an NYSE reporter, not a magazine writer at that time. I gave it a shot, did a screen test on the stock exchange floor and was hired shortly thereafter.\n\nSince then, I have covered the markets - from the NYSE to the NASDAQ - been a field reporter and created and hosted my own shows. As part of all those experiences I have covered numerous world and national news events that became very personal. I was on the NYSE trading floor on the morning of the 9/11 attacks. I remember being led to the basement for safety and seeing traders trying to reach family members, others holding back tears and so many more steadying themselves. It is a day I will never forget.\n\nIn November 2015, I also reported extensively from Paris after the terror attacks.\n\n5. My mother is the person who has had the most positive influence in my life. Every day, I think about her, and my luck to have had her in my life, as MY mom. She had lifelong health problems and that never slowed her down. She accomplished more in her life than most people given the gift of health do.\n\nHer illnesses made her push herself harder and farther. As a young person, she traveled the world teaching English on almost every continent and she was a big part of my wanting to experience life in other places. I went to school in Lyon, France and later, Paris, where I also worked, in addition to London and Singapore. My mother was also an avid reader; she pushed herself to keep learning almost to her last day.\n\nMy mother instilled in me the importance of taking responsibility for managing my money and my legal matters. She gave me very basic advice that I follow to this day: never sign any paperwork without understanding it and ask as many questions as it takes. More than a few financial advisors tried to tell my mom she didn't know what she was doing (she did) and tried to sell her products she was not interested in. She was always polite and always stood her ground.\n\nMy mom was a big fan of Louis Rukeyser's \"Wall Street Week\" TV show (which Maria Bartiromo has now taken over!).\n\nIt is partly in my mother's honor and her memory that I am so excited to create and launch \"Women & Money with Deirdre Bolton\" on Fox Business Network.\n\nMore 5 Things You Didn't Know...\n\nAinsley Earhardt\n\nTrish Regan\n\nJudge Jeanine\n\nMelissa Francis"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/02/21/tomi-lahren-final-thoughts-fox-nation-bernie-sanders-progressive-socialist-policies", "text": "In her \"Final Thoughts\" commentary on Fox Nation, Tomi Lahren slammed Sen.

Fry, 54, was charged with one count of unlawful disclosure of information obtained from so-called Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and was released on $50,000 bond after appearing in federal court in San Francisco.\n\nAccording to an affidavit by Linda Cieslak, a special agent with the U.S. Department of Treasury, Fry repeatedly searched law enforcement databases for information relating to Cohen. Fry, an investigative analyst for the IRS' law enforcement arm who has worked for the agency since 2008, is accused of gaining access to five SARs, which are filed by banks when transactions are spotted that raise questions about possible financial misconduct.\n\nAVENATTI GIVES UP CONTROL OF FIRM AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF HIDING MILLIONS: REPORT\n\nOne of the reports Fry allegedly accessed showed Cohen's Essential Consultants had received a total of $500,000 from Columbus Nova, a company associated with Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch who donated money to Trump's inauguration fund. Other payments to Essential Consultants came from AT&T ($200,000) and pharmaceutical company Novartis (approximately $399,920).\n\nCieslak said Fry called Avenatti from his cellphone three separate times and relayed the information from the SARs to the attorney verbally. The agent added that Fry admitted to doing so when investigators confronted him in November.\n\nThe affidavit says Avenatti made the information he obtained from Fry public on Twitter May 8, writing: \"Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen have a lot of explaining to do.\" Avenatti declined to say how he obtained the records, telling Fox News at the time: \"That\u2019s my work product and will not be disclosed.\"\n\nAVENATTI RUNS LAW FIRM LIKE 'PONZI SCHEME,' FORMER CLIENT CLAIMS IN COURT FILING\n\nThe affidavit also includes exchanges between Fry and reporter Ronan Farrow, who wrote a story for the New Yorker magazine about the motives behind the leak. Farrow, who is identified as \"Reporter-1\" in the affidavit, wrote in an article published May 16 that the law enforcement official who released the report had grown concerned after he was unable to find two other reports on Cohen's financial activity that he believed should have been in a government database.\n\nAccording to Cieslak, Fry told investigators in November that Farrow had contacted him to confirm information supplied to Farrow by Avenatti.\n\nAvenatti tweeted Thursday evening: \"Neither I nor R. Farrow did anything wrong or illegal with the financial info relating to Cohen\u2019s crimes (the courts have found that the [federal Bank Secrecy Act] does not apply ... And if we did (we didn\u2019t), then every reporter in America would be jailed and unable to do their job.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt the time of the disclosures, Avenatti was locked in a legal battle with Cohen over a $130,000 payment to Daniels in the days leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The payment was made in exchange for Daniels' silence about an alleged sexual encounter with the married Trump that took place more than a decade ago. Cohen pleaded guilty last August to federal campaign finance and other violations and has been sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nIf convicted, Fry faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Rather than work to correct the injustices done to the victims, the Government spent 10 years defending its own improper conduct.

CPAC, as it\u2019s known, will focus in part on those policies, like the Green New Deal. The annual conference of hardcore conservatives kicks off next Wednesday at National Harbor, where Schlapp said the theme will be \u201cWhat Makes America Great\u201d \u2013 a not-so-subtle play on Trump\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\n'Socialism does not make America great.' \u2014 Matt Schlapp\n\n\u201cAs conservatives who understand the founding of the country, there are very specific principles of what make America great,\u201d said Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. \u201cAnd the thumbnail of that is socialism does not make America great. Socialism is actually completely opposed to Americanism. And that will be explained in a variety of ways throughout CPAC.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the program kicks off Thursday with Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and North Carolina Rep.

Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, writer Andrew McCarthy and reporter Chuck Ross are scheduled to discuss Mueller\u2019s investigation during a Saturday panel on judges and prosecutors.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller probe gets right to this question about why America is unique,\u201d Schlapp said. \u201cBecause the individual has very specific rights.

I argued that, despite the fact that she has treasonously waged war against our country, she had a right to be readmitted if she tried to enter because she was \u2013 according to the facts available at the time \u2013 a natural-born American citizen.\n\nNow Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has announced that Muthana will not be allowed to reenter the U.S. because she is not an American citizen: While born in America, she was the daughter of a diplomat and thus not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. As the secretary put it in his statement, \u201cMs. Hoda Muthana is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States. She does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States.\u201d\n\nThis conclusion is disputed by Muthana\u2019s family and allies, and they may have a case. I would strongly urge the Justice Department to file an indictment against Muthana for treason, material support to terrorism, and any other readily provable offenses. She is less likely to press the issues of citizenship and right to enter if she understands that she faces prosecution and, very likely, lengthy imprisonment if she succeeds in coming here.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at the citizenship question itself. To my mind, the concept of citizenship implies not just the benefits of being a full-fledged member of the body politic, but also a duty of fealty to the nation. In a rational world, then, a citizen who made war against the United States would be stripped of citizenship.\n\nAlas, that is not the law. As I related in the Post column, Supreme Court precedent holds that natural-born citizens may not have their citizenship revoked without their consent. (This is in contrast to naturalized citizens, who may have their citizenship revoked if they join a subversive organization within five years of being naturalized, but this is not relevant to Muthana\u2019s case).\n\nTO READ THE REST OF THIS OP-ED IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW CLICK HERE\n\nTO READ MORE FROM ANDREW MCCARTHY CLICK HERE"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/un-chief-discusses-yemen-venezuela-with-pompeo", "text": "U.N.

Durban is a noisy city \u2013 it has the busiest port in sub-Saharan Africa, and its metro area consists of an estimated 3.4 million people.\n\nThe rescue team had to dig more than 20 feet into the ground to reach the baby. After nearly four hours, they were able to extract the baby and airlift her to a hospital, where she was treated for hypothermia.\n\nThe story of the miraculous rescue of this baby would make most people teary-eyed. But the detail that made me stop cold in my tracks was this: When the rescuers pulled her out of the ground, she still had her umbilical cord intact.

Think about it: Over half a dozen rescue workers in South Africa spent hours digging and searching in a storm drain, and then called a helicopter, to save a baby that clearly was not wanted. Had the baby not survived, the whole mission would have been considered a failure.\n\nWhen it comes to these types of situations, we always give life the benefit of the doubt. If someone is trapped in a building that has caught fire, firefighters don\u2019t stop and debate if the person is worth saving. They rush into the burning building, putting their own lives at risk, to save the other. In fact, they would get in trouble if they didn\u2019t act.\n\nBut when it comes to abortion, we suspend this sense of urgency to protect life. We turn it into a debate about when a life becomes worth saving.\n\nThis logic falls apart quickly when you ask: What is the difference between a fully-formed baby who is a few inches away inside the mother\u2019s womb, and a three-day-old baby who is 20 feet underground in a storm drain?\n\nFor me, there\u2019s only one clear choice in this debate: We must protect life, in all its forms and stages.

He knew that they would go for his tall tale, and they did.\n\nFor a time, it worked.

Not only will he not marry her, he is looking for the exit ramp. Some folks excuse the situation by claiming that this would have been a marital union that would not have lasted. But I am more concerned about an ethos where young women put themselves in this situation, thinking that cohabitation is eventually going to get them where they want to go, and ending up with broken dreams and lives.\n\nMarriage actually offers protection, both legal and financial, and women are doing themselves a disservice not to require a commitment when they give away their best years with no promises made in return. As a society, we have seen women gain their voices in a number of important areas recently, and it is my hope that this will be the next frontier for women to demand they be heard.\n\nWhile it is a very controversial topic, new research this week shows that marriage still beats cohabitation for satisfaction, stability, and commitment.\n\nFIVE LESSONS TO HELP YOU ENJOY A LASTING MARRIAGE\n\nThree key findings from a December 2018 survey of 2000 adults by the Wheatley Institution and the National Marriage Project are being released this week:\n\n1. Married adults were more likely than cohabiting individuals to report being highly satisfied in their relationship. Specifically, 51 percent of married adults in the survey were in the top relationship satisfaction group, versus 40 percent of cohabiting adults.\n\n2. Married individuals were more likely to report higher levels of commitment in their relationship than cohabiting individuals. Specifically, 46 percent of married adults were in the top relationship commitment group vs. slightly over 30 percent of cohabiting adults.\n\n3. Married individuals were more likely to report higher levels of stability in their relationship than cohabiting individuals. Specifically, 54 percent of married adults were in the top relationship stability group, vs. 28 percent of cohabiting adults.\n\nYears ago, my husband and I hosted a small wedding for a young couple who had no money. My husband is a former rugby player turned clergyman \u2013 a man\u2019s man, to be sure. He strongly encouraged the young man to commit in marriage to the woman who was already the mother of his baby. The couple is now thriving nine years later, with a second child; and they are thankful that someone cared enough to step in and give them loving direction.\n\nAt their wedding, a dozen young women came up to my husband and asked, \u201cWould you talk to my (usually live-in) boyfriend? He just won\u2019t commit and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d As gently as he could, my husband told them that they don\u2019t need to give themselves away without the promise of a stable future in the covenant of the marriage vows, that young men need to be held accountable or they will take what they want with sometimes little thought or conscience. Pretty old fashioned, I know. This is sincerely not intended to be male bashing, but rather to recognize that in addition to men\u2019s responsibility, women bear some of the onus if they are letting it happen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe cohabitation versus marriage choice also correlates with Professor Scott Stanley\u2019s \u201cSliding versus Deciding\u201d premise. That happens when people slide into a relationship transition and they let things happen to them, or allow others to make a decision for them, rather than being intentional and directing their own lives. When people make a deliberate and thoughtful decision, as for marriage, Stanley says they are more committed to the outcomes and future repercussions of the decision.\n\nProfessor Stanley\u2019s research, as well as these new findings from the Wheatley Institution and the National Marriage Project are further reasons this National Marriage Week (Feb. 7 to 14 every year) to consider dating with the clear goal of pursuing discernment toward lifelong commitment. One\u2019s \u201cbest years\u201d are too precious to be lost to someone who won\u2019t commit to a future."}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/first-born-only-child-middle-child-what-birth-order-reveals-about-you-and-why-you-should-care", "text": "Which description is most like you?\n\n1: A natural leader and perfectionist, you are logical, technical, well-organized, conscientious, a good reader, and a list-maker.

After studying birth order for years, I\u2019ve seen these descriptions play out over and over. Birth order isn\u2019t an exact science, because not all characteristics fit every person in that birth order. Variables such as the number of years between kids, gender, physical, emotional, or mental differences, adoption, death, blended families and a critical-eyed parent can change that birth order (for more, see \"The Birth Order Book\").\n\nWhy should you care about birth order? Because the role you played in your family has everything to do with how you perceive \u201creality.\u201d It\u2019s why a brother and sister can view the same growing-up years differently.

By the time your second brother was born, your parents barely noticed he had his finger in the electrical outlet.\n\nYou walked and talked earlier than your siblings, had a large vocabulary, and acted like an adult because you always interacted with adults. Your parents made a big deal out of everything you did, so you became a perfectionist with only one \u201cright way\u201d to do things. Anything else is \u201cwrong.\u201d That\u2019s why it drives you crazy when others \u2013 partners, kids, or coworkers \u2013 don\u2019t do tasks the same way you\u2019d do them, don\u2019t pursue goals with the same excellence you do, or don\u2019t take life as seriously.

You\u2019re used to working independently, so that\u2019s most comfortable for you. After all, no one can jump the high bar of your expectations. Problem is, you\u2019re even tougher on yourself than you are on others.\n\nIf you\u2019re a middleborn.\n\nSince you\u2019re not the superhuman, driven-to-excellence firstborn and you\u2019re not the cute baby of the family, you grew up in the hazy, anonymous \u201cmiddle\u201d where you weren\u2019t often noticed. In fact, you were the one least likely to be missed if you went AWOL at the dinner table. You could get away with being lazy sometimes because your parents didn\u2019t expect you to accomplish as much as your firstborn sibling. In fact, whatever he or she was like, you went the opposite way. After all, why try to compete with the best?\n\nBecause you were stuck between the hard-driving firstborn and the baby, who couldn\u2019t seem to get anything done without help, you frequently played \u201cpeacemaker\u201d at home. You carried that role into your loyal friend network too. But wanting everyone to get along so the waters of life stay smooth opens the door for others to easily take advantage of you.\n\nIf you\u2019re a lastborn.\n\nLife to you is a thrill ride from one adventure to another. You\u2019re highly social, spontaneous, thrive on being entertainment central, and easily make people laugh. People swarm to you like ants to honey. Growing up, you were the manipulative charmer who could get your siblings or parents to do anything for you \u2013 even things you should have been doing for yourself.

Johnson added that \"absolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared ... admitting what he did and then be man enough to offer what he should offer up in terms of all the resources that were put into this.\"\n\n\"Empire\" is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.\n\nIn less than a month, the 36-year-old changed from being the seemingly sympathetic victim of a hate crime to being accused of fabricating the entire affair for money and attetion.\n\nThe felony charge emerged on the same day detectives and the two brothers, who were initially viewed as suspects, testified before a grand jury. Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.\n\nCNN\u2019S DON LEMON: IT\u2019S \u2018NOT HIS FAULT\u2019 JUSSIE SMOLLETT LOST IN THE \u2018COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION\u2019\n\nIn a statement to Fox News on Wednesday, Smollett's attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said the actor \"enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.\"\n\nThey did not provide further comment when contacted by Fox News on Thursday.\n\nPolice said the investigation shifted after they questioned the two brothers who were in the area that morning. Police said Thursday that Smollett spoke to the brothers an hour before and an hour after he says they helped the actor stage last month's attack.\n\nSMOLLETT'S LAWYERS DENY HE PLANNED ATTACK AFTER CHICAGO COPS CLAIM HE'S NO LONGER CONSIDERED A VICTIM IN CASE\n\nDetective Commander Edward Wodnicki said at the news conference Thursday that after questioning the brothers for nearly two days last week, they were released and investigators no longer viewed them as suspects.\n\nThe brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola \"Abel\" and Olabinjo \"Ola\" Osundairo, were initially held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett. Police said one of the men had worked on \"Empire,\" and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, \"Sum of My Music,\" last year.\n\nInvestigators said they have phone records that show there were extensive communications between Smollett and the brothers. Lanier said Thursday afternoon that one of the brothers, Abel, was a source of \"designer drugs,\" including Molly, for the actor.\n\nSHARPTON, AT MEETING WITH KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS SMOLLETT SHOULD FACE \u2018MAXIMUM\u2019 PUNISHMENT IF ALLEGATIONS TRUE\n\nWodnicki said the brothers testified before a grand jury before prosecutors charged Smollett on Wednesday. Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the brothers appeared before the panel to \"lock in their testimony.\"Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met on Wednesday, the brothers' attorney said the two men testified for about two-and-a-half hours.\n\n\"There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we're going to correct this,\" Gloria Schmidt said.\n\nShe said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. \"You don't need immunity when you have the truth,\" she said.\n\nJUSSIE SMOLLETT DIDN'T GIVE BRETT KAVANAUGH THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BUT ASKS FOR IT NOW\n\nShe also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nBut several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS JUSSIE SMOLLETT FOR SMEARING SUPPORTERS WITH \u2018RACIST AND DANGEROUS COMMENTS\u2019\n\nSmollett has a record, one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cautioned that the U.S. would not be able to team up with, nor share, crucial intelligence information that countries that go forth in enabling Huawei Technologies.\n\n\u201cWhether through classic economic espionage, intellectual property theft, or espionage on behalf of a government, the global footprint and technology reach of Huawei easily makes it a security risk to U.S. interests,\u201d Erik Rasmussen, Head of Cybersecurity and Risk Management Solutions at public accounting firm Grobstein Teeple, told Fox News. \u201cGiven the size of the company, it is a difficult undertaking to quickly and swiftly track spying with or without Huawei\u2019s knowledge, but direct influence on business operations by the Chinese government is undeniable.\u201d\n\nU.S authorities have expressed a growing concern the telecom conglomerate could \u2013 as a result of 2017 legislation in China that permits the government to keep tabs on people under the guise of national security \u2013 undertake \u201cundetected espionage\u201d on users.\n\nANNUAL UN GATHERING A HOTBED FOR SPIES, MANY FROM US ADVERSARIES\n\nThe 2017 legislation mandates all China-owned companies must comply with the government\u2019s intelligence wing should it be requested, meaning that if Huawei is asked to do so and denies to so, they could be breaking their own national security laws.\n\nThe issue has not only caused a schism in U.S. relations with Canada \u2013 who have conveyed frustration in having absorbed retaliation from the Chinese government for detaining the company\u2019s CFO Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request by the U.S \u2013 but threatens alliances with Europe too.\n\nGermany this week made the preliminary determination to continue to the process in allowing Huawei to partake in developing their high-speed internet infrastructure after their own investigation found no sufficient proof its equipment could be used to spy. Britain is currently examining the tech giant\u2019s products, and is expected to make a decision in the coming weeks.\n\nOver the past year, the Trump team has been ramping up pressure on its European allies to drastically limit or entirely rebuff Huawei\u2019s involvement in both developing the 5G infrastructure and its presence on existing networks. While Huawei has mostly been barred in the United States, its foothold in Europe is strong.\n\n\u201cNext to Apple and Samsung, Huawei is the world\u2019s largest mobile technology company in terms of market share, so if the company is compromised from within, the risk is undeniable,\u201d Rasmussen said. \u201cGiven the historical alliances between the US and many European countries where Huawei technology is common, there is a vested interest to track this accordingly and share information when prudent. The UK and Germany will naturally have to weigh the costs and benefits to allowing risky technology in their country.\u201d\n\nPENTAGON POINTS TO CHINA, RUSSIA COMPETITION IN NEW AI STRATEGY\n\nHowever, the Huawei president and former Chinese army engineer Ren Zhengfei \u2013 whose daughter Wanzhou has been held Canadian authorities for almost three awaiting possible extradition \u2013 continues to deny that the company assists the Chinese government in collecting intelligence through its devices. \u201cEven if we were required by Chinese law, we would firmly reject that,\u201d Zhengfei said in a CBS interview.\n\nThe Chinese government has also consistently and firmly refuted U.S. accusations that they have either the will or capacity to funnel off personal data and information.\n\nExperts and analysts remain far from convinced.\n\n\u201cIf these pieces of electronic equipment used in telecom infrastructure are compromised \u2013 for example, by having hidden backdoors, which allow for access with specific access codes \u2013 this would enable Chinese intelligence to have access to western telecoms networks, \u2018sniffing\u2019 and listening to all information such as data and voice going through that equipment,\u201d explained J. Eduardo Campos, Chief Information Security Specialist and founder of Embedded-Knowledge Inc. \u201cHuawei denies it vehemently, but given the recent history of State-sponsored hacking by the Chinese government, it makes anyone suspicious. Moreover, Chinese tech companies could, in theory, be compelled by the Chinese government to modify their technology for spying purposes. And we would never know it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Campos, the 5G technology \u2013 the next iteration of mobile network technology \u2013 could potentially help cities become smarter, improving traffic management, citizen services, and access to public information from mobile devices. Therefore, it will enable many types of cutting-edge applications, such as self-driving cars and remotely operated devices.\n\n\u201cThey will be able to send and receive large amounts of data faster than it is currently possible. One way of seeing a potential threat is that an increased reliance on mobile technologies means its disruption would have serious consequences, both in terms of safety as well as the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he observed. \u201cImagine that a failure because a remote hacking by a foreign power could lead to the death of patients, the crash of self-driving cars, or even just halting down airplanes on the ground because of massive system outages.

At only 19 years old, and after dropping out of Community College in his home state of Washington, he accepted an offer from a friend to live with him on the Valley Island. Chris would spend his days smoking weed and drinking, followed by bunking up in a tent on a beach or his buddy\u2019s van if there was room.\n\nHe was working just enough to get by as a server at the prestigious Bubba Gump, Maui. When one day a street preacher walked up to Pratt and his friends and asked: \u201cWhat are you doing tonight?\u201d Chris alluded to an unruly night of doing what they do best; drugs, alcohol and hopefully bunking up with a lady friend. The preacher invited the group to his church service as an alternate plan. Ditching his friends that night, Pratt became a Christian two days later.\n\nPratt is now a regular attendee of LA\u2019s Zoe Church along several other A-List Celebrities. Zoe is similar in popularity to megachurches Hillsong & PlanetShakers, all of which could fall into a category vastly different from what non-church people would consider religious services.\n\nComing from a background where church almost seemed like it was supposed to be painful, I can see why millennials and Gen Z\u2019ers are opting out of the whole \u2018religion thing.\u2019 As a man who\u2019s attended Catholic Mass, I can say that my way knowing that church is working, is that you should feel some level of boredom throughout the service.\n\nI USED TO FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT MY FAITH UNTIL THIS AMAZING THING HAPPENED\n\nI can\u2019t say that being forced to go to Mass was a great experience in my history of faith, and I\u2019m definitely not alone when it comes to the countless millennials who grew up in their parent\u2019s church or private schooling, only to slip out the second they\u2019re outside their mother\u2019s grasp. What Calvary, Hillsong and other modern churches are doing to attract millennials and celebrities is an incredible transformation of preaching and entertainment. Millennial-based churches are turning religion into a relationship, with the goal of bringing in anyone willing to listen closer to God, and isn\u2019t that what church is supposed to be doing?\n\n\"We don't use the word 'religion,' because it's hard to get people excited about religion,\" Carl Lentz, 35, the pastor of Hillsong told the NY Daily News. \"Religion is dead. I don't know anything about religion, I couldn't help you. Religion has no power. But a relationship with God is a superpower.\"\n\nWith a growing demand for life-altering faith-based content, these churches are conducting as many as six services each and every Sunday to audiences in the tens of thousands. The services aren\u2019t in your traditional \u2018priest in a pulpit\u2019 format and the multimedia production rivals that of any Hollywood Studio. These services are extending even further beyond their live audiences with Hillsong alone producing music videos, daily messages and the like through their social media channels. Broadcasting to an exponentially larger audience around the globe. It\u2019s the powerful message in a cool atmosphere that keeps the kids coming back. Much like the law of attraction, cool things attract cool people. Cool people like Justin Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Selena Gomez, Kevin Durant, Nick Jonas and Bono.\n\nBieber\u2019s trials and tribulations have been well documented to say the least, but just to recap, 2014 was a big year for Justin\u2026 And not in the good way. Drugs, excessive drinking, trying to illegally import a pet monkey, spending a night in jail for underage drag racing\u2026 You know, normal stuff for a 20-year-old Canadian multi-millionaire. It wasn\u2019t until Hillsong\u2019s pastor, Carl Lentz entered the picture that Justin was able to turn his life and image around for the better. According to GQ, Bieber had a true coming to Jesus moment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter looking in the mirror, he was ravaged by feelings of loss and fell to his knees, crying \u201cI want to know Jesus.\u201d Praying with Pastor Carl and overcome by the gospel, he said: \u201cBaptize me.\u201d After numerous failed attempts to find a private body of water to conduct a proper baptism, they ended up in Tyson Chandler\u2019s (formally on the New York Knicks) bathroom, conducting the ceremony in Tyson\u2019s oversized bathtub (he\u2019s over 7 feet tall). The spiritual rebirth since carried over to the digital world through Christian messaging and support for his home church, Hillsong, throughout social media. What once included lyrics that any evangelical would frown upon, he now posts cover\u2019s from Hillsong\u2019s home band\u2019s music.\n\nFrom Bieber to Snoop Dog. Snoop Dog may be one of the greatest rappers of our generation. What he\u2019s not known for is Gospel music. Well, that was until March of 2018 when his Snoop Dog Presents: Bible of Love hit No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Top Gospel Albums Chart. Not to be outdone, Kanye West is rumored to be producing a Gospel album of his own.\n\nAfter posting a TMZ Live, 112 crooner Slim hinted that Kanye West could soon be dropping some new music with a totally different vibe. In his video, he strongly hinted at a Christian music collaboration between 112 and Yeezy himself. Recently, his tweets even allude to using apps to read the BIBLE and PRAY. Regardless of his previous shenanigans, I\u2019m confident that the musical genius will be able to pull some more fire from his brain.\n\nThe demand for faith-based content is catching the attention of more than just A-List celebrities and musicians alike, with Hollywood Studios vying for underserved and discerning faith-based audiences. Such effort produced multiple surprise hits such as \u201cHeaven Is for Real\u201d and \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead.\u201d Given their popularity, the rate of faith-based films released in theaters annually has doubled since 2012, to about 12 a year. Still, the undefeated heavyweight in this category is Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cPassion of the Christ,\u201d which set the bar for religious-based films, grossing $611 million worldwide off of a $30 million budget.\n\nMainstream media and celebrities are starting to talk about their faith, more faith-based content is being produced than ever before, rappers known for their hardcore gangster lyrics are turning to Gospel music and these mega-churches are taking a step back from traditional religious services in order to elicit a positive experience for younger generations. So, what does this all mean and where do we go from here?\n\nOne problem that currently exists is lacking a central platform to organize and deliver this multimedia for audiences who are generally interested in faith-based content but are overwhelmed and don\u2019t want to go to a church IRL (in real life). Digging through social media is like trying to find a diamond in a land-fill. Churches like Hillsong may have great content, but the community experience can\u2019t be replicated online by a single entity, and sometimes people want to get content from other faith leaders\u2026 like Kanye West\u2026 just kidding, like Matt Chandler.\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s ever asked, how can we get more young people to our church, the answer is being paved in stone by organizations like Hillsong & Zoe. In communities like Los Angeles and New York, where faith-based organizations must interact with their congregations on the go, technology is critical.

They wanted to take them away and I begged them not too, I said I would do whatever I could to protect them,\u201d Jamial, a 35-year-old Iraqi, who in recent months made a quiet conversion to Christianity, told Fox News. \u201cSo for two years and eight months, we were forced to live under their rule and do what they say.\u201d\n\nJamial was born in the Old City of Mosul. His dad died three years before ISIS overran his beloved city, and he \u2013 as the eldest son \u2013 was left to take care of his mother and two younger siblings, working in a local supermarket to make ends meet. As the battle to reclaim Mosul gathered intensity in the first half of 2017, Jamial left behind all his belongings and fled north to a displacement camp in the Kurdish capital of Erbil.\n\nBut one saving grace, he said, has been turning to Christianity since leaving Mosul \u2013 and doing so in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan, where he feels somewhat safer.\n\n\u201cI know in my heart God will save me,\u201d Jamial said.\n\nISIS TEEN WIFE BEMOANS UK'S 'UNJUST' DECISION TO REVOKE HER CITIZENSHIP\n\nYet the healing process is slow, and the memories still haunt.\n\n\u201cI can never go back to Mosul, there is no civil reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. I have psychological problems and nightmares every night, worrying that ISIS will come back and kill me and take away my mother and my sister because every I worried about that,\u201d Jamial stressed. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t sleep at all. I don\u2019t know yet if I can trust anyone, ISIS were savages and killing people for simple mistakes.\u201d\n\nIRAQI CHRISTIANS IN BAGHDAD NEARLY GONE, BUT SOME SHELTER AT CAMP VIRGIN MARY\n\nFor Sam, formerly Saleem \u2013 a 26-year-old caf\u00e9 worker in Baghdad \u2013 his conversion came at the height of the ISIS chaos in his country three years ago.\n\n\u201cI was a faithful Muslim, as was my family. But I saw all the bloodshed around me, I became sympathetic to what the Christians were experiencing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis sadness touched my heart. I first learned more, then I changed.\u201d\n\nHowever, since the very beginning of the rise of ISIS, Imams, Islamic leaders and scholars across the globe have denounced the extreme ideology and accused the barbaric group of twisting their religion to fit a nefarious agenda.\n\nYet a switch to Christianity often doesn\u2019t come without consequences.\n\nWhile the passage from another faith into Islam is mainstream and widely discussed, conversions from Islam to other faiths are often staunchly prohibited and come with dangerous repercussions and retribution \u2013 meaning most must be kept shrouded in secrecy with names and identities protected.\n\n\u201cApostasy is a capital offense according to traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Those who convert are customarily threatened to death from either sharia-based states, radical mobs and/or their own families,\u201d explained John Eibner, a human rights advocate and the CEO of Christian Solidarity International-USA. \u201cThose who convert are sometimes secretly baptized, usually after a long, secret period of reflection and instruction in the faith. But it is dangerous, and those involved must exercise great discretion.\u201d\n\nANDREW MCCARTHY: WHY IT'S SO HARD TO REVOKE THE CITIZENSHIP OF TERRORISTS\n\nSam said that every day he still feels paralyzed with fear.\n\n\u201cI was afraid; I am still afraid,\" he said. \"My old friends do not communicate with me any longer and my parents have left me on my own. I mostly befriend other Christians but some of them do not believe I have converted completely. They think I could be a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\n\n\u201cThey ask why a Muslim would convert? I do not have an answer. I tell them God works in mysterious ways. But even if my friends and family have turned against me, it is like one chapter is done and the next page is turning.\u201d\n\nEven before ISIS, some in the Middle East said they made a move cloaked in both fear and anticipation.\n\nAzad Barwari, a pastor at Magnolia Baptist Church in Anaheim, California \u2013 specializing in ministry to Muslim refugees \u2013 said he converted in the year 2000 while living in the Kurdish city of Zakho near the Turkish border.\n\n\u201cAs a result of my conversion out of Islam, I was persecuted by my family so I fled Iraq and lived in Lebanon for several years where I was imprisoned and tortured,\u201d Barwari claimed. \u201cI came to the USA in 2009 as a religious refugee.\u201d\n\nWHY I LEFT ISIS: FORMER BAGHDADI 'FRIEND' AND AIDE, OTHERS SPEAK OUT\n\nHe said that as a result, he has received two death threats in the U.S, which he has reported to authorities, but otherwise refuses to shy away from sharing his thoughts and experiences.\n\n\u201cIn the year 2000, someone gave me the New Testament when I was sitting at a store in Zakho. It was during Ramadan and I was fasting,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe book was in an envelope and I didn\u2019t know it was a Bible. I liked reading and I had a spiritual hunger. This touched my heart, and Christ answered me. We Kurds were living in enmity and I was angry and I need peace.\u201d\n\nChristianity has for decades been dwindling in the Middle East amid a climate of persecution and insecurity, but the ISIS onslaught over four years ago prompted tens of thousands more to flee.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that less than five percent of the Syrian and Iraqi population is Christian, a sharp decline from the roughly ten percent a decade ago.\n\nFor others in the region, the ISIS incursion has not necessarily meant a conversion into another faith, but a deeper reflection and move away from religion altogether.\n\n\u201cWhen ISIS came and the chaos of them kidnapping Yazidi girls and making them sex slaves, and killing anyone who didn\u2019t fit their perspective made me think twice,\u201d one 35-year-old Iraq-based female professional, who can only be identified as Saleema, explained. \u201cI wanted to be free and just be a good person with good manners without following any belief. Now, I don\u2019t follow any religion. I don\u2019t want to hear stories to satisfy or control.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to Alex McFarland, a U.S-based apologist and noted church speaker, conversions to Christianity are far more prevalent in the Middle East than Westerners realize \u201cand the unconscionable actions of ISIS have prompted (that).\u201d\n\n\u201cInterestingly, some ex-Muslims merely become atheists,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t really land anywhere else, such as another faith system.

Testing will start with the 2019 Ford Ranger small pickup truck, and if problems are found, the company will start looking at models dating to 2017.\n\nFord says it has no evidence yet that mileage or pollution numbers are wrong, but the investigation has just started. The company says it's too early to tell how many and which models might be involved.\n\n2019 FORD RANGER TEST DRIVE\n\nDepending on what is found, Ford could be required to restate the mileage on EPA-approved window stickers as well as reimburse owners for the mileage difference. The company could also face penalties from the government agencies.\n\n\"At Ford, we believe that trust in our brand is earned by acting with integrity and transparency,\" Kim Pittel, the company's vice president for environment and safety engineering, said Thursday. \"We have a process for looking at how we perform and behave in our broad and complex company.\"\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, which monitor emissions and mileage, have been informed of the probe, according to the company.\n\nThe EPA said in a statement that Ford disclosed the issues on Tuesday.\n\n\"The investigation is ongoing and the information is too incomplete for EPA to reach any conclusions,\" the agency said. \"We take the potential issues seriously and are following up with the company to fully understand the circumstances behind this disclosure.\"\n\nThe problems do not involve \"defeat device\" software that activates pollution controls for emissions tests and turns them off on the road, according to Ford. For years, Volkswagen used a defeat device to cheat on diesel emissions tests until they were caught by university researchers and a nonprofit organization. Ford said the investigation is focused on vehicles with gasoline engines.\n\nIn an interview, Pittel said it's too early to tell how widespread the problem is or if it goes beyond 2017 models. \"We're just going to go where the investigation takes us,\" she said. \"We will be very, very thorough.\"\n\nMost emissions and mileage tests are done by automakers and spot-checked for accuracy by the EPA and California. The tests are done on a dynamometer, which is a treadmill-like device, and the mathematical model makes calculations for \"road load,\" which is drag from wind, tire rolling resistance, drag from engine-driven devices and other factors.\n\n\"We have identified potential concerns with how we calculate road load,\" Pittel said.\n\nIf problems are found, it won't be the first time Ford has had to restate mileage. In 2014, the Dearborn, Michigan, company had to cut the window sticker mileage on six models, and had to pay thousands of dollars to more than 200,000 owners after errors were discovered in how the mileage was calculated. The company said the latest issues are unrelated to the 2014 problems. The company also had to restate mileage on the C-Max gas-electric hybrid in 2013.\n\nThe Ford cases came after a 2012 EPA investigation found inflated mileage on 13 Hyundai and Kia models, affecting 900,000 vehicles."}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/auto/2019-nissan-altima-awd-test-drive-double-your-pleasure", "text": "In the face of a market shift away from cars to trucks and utilities, Nissan is doubling-down on the Altima sedan. So to speak.\n\nThe all-new 2019 model is the first Nissan sedan available with all-wheel-drive, which gives it twice as many driven wheels as before. It\u2019s one of only three cars in the segment that offer the all-weather option, along with the Subaru Legacy and Ford Fusion, which will soon be discontinued to make room for more SUVs.\n\nMost midsize sedans don\u2019t have it because most people don\u2019t really need it, and the ones that do are often also looking for the added ground clearance they get in an SUV. Nissan is apparently hoping there are more than a few customers left in the snowbelt states who\u2019d still prefer to keep a low profile.\n\nNISSAN INVENTED THE BEST HUMP SEAT EVER\n\nTo drive the point home, it even turned an Altima into a snowmobile by putting a set of tracks on it. As of now, they are not on the accessories list.\n\nSeeing as how an All-tima costs just $1,350 more than a front-wheel-drive model, which starts at $24,645, it may be a safety-first no-brainer for everyone. You never know when you\u2019re going to get transferred to Minneapolis, after all. Both versions come with a 188 hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder and CVT automatic transmission standard. (A revolutionary 268 hp 2.0-liter turbo with variable compression is optional on some FWD trims.)\n\nAside from the cash, the only things you have to give up to get all-wheel-drive are a couple of miles per gallon, The AWD Altima is rated at 29/30 mpg combined, depending on the model, compared to the FWD\u2019s 31/32 mpg. Those are excellent numbers across the board for the Altima\u2019s class.\n\nThe new Altima is a smidge bigger than the old one, which was already one of the largest \u201cmidsize\u201d sedans. Rear legroom is generous, and the trunk is big enough to help make a case for it against a utility vehicle. The sharply-creased bodywork and floating roof effect are cribbed from the Maxima and Murano. Inside, it has a clean design, with simple controls, a tablet-style infotainment system and -- in the top of the line Platinum trim level I tested \u2013 a snazzy wood strip stretching from door to door.\n\nThe Platinum cost $34,025, but comes fully-loaded with every Altima feature, including automatic emergency brakes, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, a 360-degree camera and Nissan\u2019s ProPilot Assist semi-autonomous driving aid, which can self-steer the car within a lane as long as you have a hand touching the steering wheel. ProPilot Assist does a better job of keeping the car centered than most lane-keeping systems, but only works if there are clear lines for it to see and will quickly disengage if it doesn\u2019t. So you\u2019ll want to keep your eyes on the road too.\n\nRegardless of what kind of road that is, the Altima impresses. It\u2019s smooth and quiet on the highway and can soak up bumps around town, but is still tight enough to take on a twisty mountain pass without making a mess of it. Unfortunately, the weather didn\u2019t cooperate while I had it. Which is to say it was beautiful, so I\u2019ll have to get back to you about how well the all-wheel-drive works in such situations. Nissan does make a lot of trucks and SUVs, though, so it's not exactly new to the concept.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that the Altima feels much more solid and refined overall than the outgoing edition, which I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in thanks to its ubiquity as a rental car. This one deserves a better fate, but I won't complain if a desk agent hands me the keys to one, even if I'm on a ski trip.\n\nMORE FROM FOX NEWS AUTOS"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/auto/chevys-electric-camaro-can-do-wheelies", "text": "Chevrolet's new electric car is so quick that it can fly.

That\u2019s ironic considering the debate which now simmers over whether President Trump overstepped presidential authority to redistribute money for his border wall. This is especially prescient considering how lawmakers guard Congressional prerogatives. Ceding power of the purse to the executive establishes a new precedent in American government. This is precisely the concern Washington raised when he spoke of \u201cencroachment\u201d and limiting power within \u201cconstitutional spheres.\u201d\n\nTRUMP NEEDS A TRANSFER, MAY HAVE TO ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL\n\nPolicymakers always have exercised a healthy tension between the legislative branch and the executive branch. But none other than Alexander Hamilton called for what he characterized as \u201cenergy\u201d in the executive when writing Federalist #70, the precursor set of documents which helped form the Constitution.\n\nHamilton demanded an active executive to curb legislative overreaches and to pose as a bulwark against Congress. In this instance, Trump asserts there\u2019s an emergency at the border. So he needs the wall. Maybe. Maybe not. But this is why the founders formed a system of checks and balances. There\u2019s a question about just how much latitude the president has when it comes to repurposing funds Congress designated for something else. The Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power of the purse. All presidents can do is either sign or veto bills after lawmakers decide to spend money. Trump\u2019s plan to rejigger billions of dollars of already appropriated spending by Congress could be a problem.\n\nPresidents long have tested the parameters of executive authority. President Woodrow Wilson declared a \u201cnational emergency\u201d in 1917 because of an \u201cinsufficiency of maritime tonnage\u201d to carry U.S. agricultural and manufacturing commodities. Congress approved the National Emergencies Act of 1976, granting presidents the ability to act on any number of priorities they may deem an emergency. Presidents have declared 58 national emergencies since 1976. Thirty-one are renewed each year.\n\nFrom a parliamentary perspective, Fox News is told that the National Emergencies Act is a legislative mess. It lacks focus, specificity and is inherently vague.\n\n\u201cIt is not the gold standard for writing legislation,\u201d confided one source.\n\nThat said, Congress can terminate declarations of national emergencies with the adoption of a joint resolution by both bodies of Congress. It needs a simple majority and must earn a presidential signature. If the president vetoes a House/Senate joint resolution, those bodies can move to override the veto with a two-thirds vote.\n\nThe House likely would seek action to revoke the national emergency as it pertains to the wall. But this process is far thornier in the Senate. The statute contains imprecise verbiage as to how the Senate may consider the legislation and whether certain, special procedural motions fly in the face of debating the statute. For instance, the law requires the Senate to vote on overturning the national emergency after \u201cthree days.\u201d But what constitutes \u201cthree days?\u201d Three full days of debate? A motion to adjourn is one of the most-privileged motions in the Senate. What happens if the Senate were to adjourn without first finishing work to repeal the national emergency?\n\nCAPITOL GRAPPLES WITH COMPLICATED HISTORY ON RACE\n\nAs one source said to Fox News, \u201cIf (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell doesn\u2019t want the resolution to come up, it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen rushing to the Senate floor to announce that Trump would sign the spending package last week, McConnell also declared he was on board with the national emergency. A few weeks ago, McConnell\u2019s position on Congressional action to rebuke a national emergency was hazier. But McConnell\u2019s position grew definitive when asked by Fox News about Trump using executive authority to mine appropriations bills for wall funding.\n\n\u201cHe ought to feel free to use whatever tools he wants to use to secure the border. I would not be troubled by that,\u201d replied McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nDemocrats are apoplectic that Trump would go to such lengths to bypass Congress. Many Republicans are, too. That\u2019s why a Senate vote to reverse the national emergency could prove so interesting. Some Senate Republicans also have shown a willingness to buck Trump when it comes to foreign policy. Some Republicans have broken with the administration over an early withdrawal from Syria, relaxing of U.S. sanctions on Russia and how the president dealt with Saudi Arabia following the death of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe other problem staring at the Trump administration is the \u201cYoungstown Steel Case.\u201d The 1952 Supreme Court case Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer is thought to be the most consequential rebuff of presidential powers in history. In fact during his confirmation hearing, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh cited the case as one of the most important rulings ever handed down by the High Court. It\u2019s possible Trump could face a dim view on his expansion of appropriation powers at the Supreme Court. Moreover, it will be interesting to see how Kavanaugh interprets the president\u2019s maneuver, considering his testimony about \u201cYoungstown Steel\u201d last year.\n\nThe question on the table is why Congress should exist if the president is able to trample on legislative spending authority.\n\nThe late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., long worried about what would happen to Congress if it forked over powers to the executive branch.

Compare that to the only nine percent of boomers who responded the same.\n\nInterestingly, nearly one in three millennials feel they will actually never be able to afford a down payment, and 27 percent say the only way they will ever home is through inheritance. The home market seems to be shifting in a way that is preventing millennials from achieving their home-owning dreams.\n\nNearly half of millennials (47 percent) believe that buying a home now is a lot more difficult than it was thirty years ago.\n\nAnd they aren\u2019t the only ones that think so -- over half of boomers (51 percent) feel the same way, with one in four saying they \u201cstrongly\u201d believe so.\n\nSaid Thomas Sponholtz, Unison CEO: \u201cMillennials are very cynical, more so than their boomer counterparts, when it comes to home buying and are concerned about piling on additional debt. They want flexibility and control of their life and their finances. When they partner with Unison, who will contribute up to 15% of the down payment, millennials have the ability to buy a home, while still having cash on hand to live the life they want.\u201d\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just the housing market that\u2019s gotten worse -- at least according to millennials.\n\nAccording to the data, only eight percent of millennial respondents disagree that life is harder in general now than it was when baby boomers were their age.\n\nAnd it\u2019s having a detrimental effect on their mentality, as over twice as many millennials feel they will never achieve their dreams than baby boomers.\n\nWhen it comes to jobs it\u2019s the same story.\n\nThe survey asked respondents if they\u2019d ever had trouble just finding a job and found that 26 percent of baby boomers said they had. When it comes to millennials, that number doubled (49 percent).\n\nThe ability to not afford a down payment on a home has altered quite a bit of millennials\u2019 trajectory, too.\n\nFor example, one in three millennials say they\u2019ve changed their life plan due to not being able to afford a down payment on a home, and another 22 percent put off getting married for the same reason.\n\nOne in four (24 percent) have actually put off having kids. Only 5 percent of boomers could say they\u2019ve ever done the same.\n\n\u201cWith student debt and rising home prices, millennials have it harder than their baby boomer counterparts did at the same age,\u201d continued Sponholtz. \u201cOwning a home is a fundamental human desire and they might be willing to give up their iPhone, brunch, and marriage to own a home, but with Unison they don\u2019t have to; instead, they can own the home, instead of the home owning them.\u201d\n\nWHAT WOULD MILLENNIALS DO FOR THEIR \u2018DREAM HOME?\u2019\n\nI would give up my iPhone forever 29%\n\nI would never post on Instagram again 47%\n\nI would give up Chipotle forever 48%\n\nI would never eat avocado toast again 39%\n\nI would break up with my partner 9%\n\nI would have gone to Fyre Fest 23%\n\nI would go to jail for a week 25%\n\nI would listen to 'Cotton Eye Joe' for a week straight 42%\n\nI would survive in the wild for a week 28%\n\nI would give up sex for five years 16%\n\nI would give up sex for ten years 13%\n\nI would give up brunch forever 36%\n\nI would run a marathon 38%"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/auto/honda-ridgeline-recalled-for-fire-risk-caused-by-car-wash-soap", "text": "Honda is recalling 106,683 Ridgeline pickups in the United States, because they could catch fire after being cleaned.\n\nThe issue stems from the Ridgeline's fuel pump feed port, which can be corroded over time by the kinds of acids found in some car wash soaps, leading to cracks that may allow gas to leak out.\n\nOwners of the 2017 to 2019 vehicles will be notified and Honda will inspect and, if necessary, replace the fuel pumps and also install a new fuel pump cover.\n\nHONDA RIDGELINE TEST DRIVE\n\nHonda has not advised owners to refrain from driving or washing their vehicles.\n\nThe recall is scheduled to being March 7.\n\nHonda is also recalling approximate 437,000 vehicles across several other model lines for an unrelated fuel pump issue caused by sodium particulates in gasoline sticking to internal components that could lead to stalling.

Yet the souls of the damned sit there starving, as they have spoons that can reach into the pot -- but can\u2019t reach the food.\n\nWhile New York sits atop the Marcellus Shale, with more than 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which equates to more than 85 billion barrels of oil, the state is facing rapidly rising natural gas prices and spot shortages. Thanks to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s ban on horizontal fracking, instead of a flow of cheap, abundant New York homegrown natural gas, the state now faces rising prices.\n\nInstead of being almost independent on gas, they must pipeline in supply from places as far away as Texas.\n\nDuring the recent polar vortex, New York utilities could not keep the gas on and keep people warm. In a state where they have seen a transition from old-fashioned dirty heating oil, to much cleaner natural gas, the demand is rising faster than supply, freezing out some customers. One state utility, Con Ed, has declared a moratorium on new gas connections and is also raising prices to consumers by a whopping 11 percent in homes that heat with natural gas, and a 6 percent rise for electricity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd adding even more fuel to the fire is the fact that New York is making it almost impossible to increase supply as the Cuomo administration drags its feet or blocks pipelines. Somehow, the safest transit for oil and natural gas pipelines are getting a bad rap, even though almost all of New York City has pipelines, but they still need more.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThe moral of the story is that environmental extremism is costing the state business, as businesses can\u2019t open without natural gas supply and real estate projects get put on hold. This is also costing the state an untold numbers of jobs, not only in the natural gas and utilities business, but all businesses that can\u2019t operate in the state because of a shortage of natural gas supply.\n\nIf this is the damage that environmental extremism can do in just New York, Rep.

Going online to file taxes is an easy and efficient alternative to high postage prices and long waiting times.\n\nWhile this shift in filing benefits taxpayers and the IRS, the trend highlights a growing problem at another beleaguered agency: the United States Postal Service (USPS). Without greater coordination and adaptability between the IRS and USPS, both agencies will suffer key setbacks to the detriment of taxpayers across the country.\n\nThis predicament facing the USPS highlights a larger issue with declining mail delivery and corresponding revenue. Five year mail revenue is down by more than $3 billion.

It\u2019s one reason why eight of the 12 countries abandoned their own wealth tax, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation\u2019s Nicole Kaeding.\n\nWealth taxes \u201care difficult taxes to administer and that\u2019s because the uber wealthy tend to have assets that are very difficult to value,\u201d she told FOX Business. \u201cIt would add a lot of compliance costs to the IRS, they would have to beef up their enforcement and auditing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the strategies that the ultra-rich may employ is shifting wealth into closely held stocks, artwork and other collectible items that can be difficult to value, pooling assets among trusted associates and divesting money into third-party insurance policies, tactics the IRS is already intimately familiar with.\n\nThe agency currently evaluates an individual\u2019s assets when calculating the estate tax. But the process is difficult and can lead to legal disputes between the family of the deceased and the IRS that take years to resolve.\n\nMany assets, like real estate or businesses, fluctuate year by year, sometimes even daily in the case of stock ownership. And imposing a set threshold \u2013 in this case, $50 million \u2013 would almost certainly encourage the wealthy to, among the other tactics, try to redistribute assets to siblings, children or spouses in an attempt to avoid the tax.\n\n\u201cThe real enforcement challenges occur during taxpayers lives when they find ways to shift assets out of their estate\u2026and reduce the amount of the estate tax,\u201d Joshua Blank, a law professor at the University of California, said. \u201cToday, the best way for the wealthy to avoid tax on their assets is to hold onto them until they die. The Warren proposal would tax the wealthy during life.\"\n\nTo help remedy this, Warren is proposing \u201ca significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget.\u201d The plan also calls for a minimum audit rate for the wealthy \u2013 a measure that would hike the agency\u2019s litigation costs, according to Moritz College of Law\u2019s Stephanie Hoffer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that they anticipate people trying to minimize the liability, perhaps in creative ways,\u201d she told FOX Business.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 25672.36 -290.15 -1.12% I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 7739.89551 -99.06 -1.26% SP500 S&P 500 2823.59 -31.29 -1.10%\n\nAnother significant question is how the proposal would address pass-through businesses, or those companies that are structured in a way that profits flow through to the owner who is then taxed at an individual rate. Executives of such entities could theoretically be worth millions \u2013 given their overall wealth is tied to the valuation of the firm -- but only command a sliver of that as take-home income.\n\nWarren\u2019s proposal would allow individuals with \u201cextremely high net worth but liquidity constraints\u201d to defer tax payments for up to five years with interest.\n\nDespite the challenges, however, experts say the plan is feasible.\n\n\u201cFrom the broad contours of this, we can safely say that there\u2019d be valuation issues, there\u2019d be tax avoidance and evasion issues. But that\u2019s not to say that this is impossible,\u201d said Leandra Lederman, a tax professor at Indiana University.\n\nGiven the potential challenges around implementation, there are also questions around exactly how much revenue such a plan would generate.\n\nWarren says it could net the federal government an added $2.7 trillion over a decade, money that would be used to fund initiatives like universal child care. That includes the expectation that at least 15 percent of filers would successfully engage in tax avoidance measures, but some experts say it could be even higher.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s currently the amount the federal government loses under the income tax, which is a much easier tax to administer,\u201d the Tax Foundation's Kaeding said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nRevenue from tax reform is also hotly debated and is often influenced by one\u2019s ideological view.

I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re here now, with the #MeToo movement,\u201d Parton told Sky News while discussing her hit Broadway musical \u201c9 to 5,\u201d based on the 1980 film, which is set to hit the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cIt kind of brought up the subject again of harassment in the workplace and brought up the fact that women are still not getting the chance to do as much as they can or paid, you know, equal for the work that they do. So there\u2019s still all those issues. I really think when that came out in the 80s it really did do a lot of good. It really did shine the light on that.\u201d\n\nDOLLY PARTON DENIES RUMORS THAT HER BEST FRIEND IS HER SECRET LOVER, 'PEOPLE LOVE TO TALK'\n\nWhen asked if she had ever experienced any real issues in her career that could be highlighted by the #MeToo movement, Parton, 73, said that wasn\u2019t anything she ever considered and simply went about handling her career and business sector empire the only way she knew how.\n\n\u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t really think about it like that at the time because I had grown up with men,\" Parton explained to Sky News. \"I have six brothers, my dad, my uncles \u2014 I was always close to all the men in my family. I\u2019ve known a lot of great men. So I didn\u2019t think about it that much. Of course, I\u2019ve been hit on all my life as any young girl would be \u2014 but I always take it as a compliment. I never did anything to try and get ahead in the business. I never slept with anybody unless I wanted to.\u201d\n\nThe \"Jolene\" songstress continued: \u201cI never found myself in any of those positions or I tried to stay out of those positions, and if I found myself in that, I was lucky I had a great personality and a great sense of humor that I could joke my way out of a lot of it \u2014 and then if I couldn\u2019t, I have a temper and backbone so I could get out of it some other way.\u201d\n\n\"I did work and it was a man\u2019s world back then, but I enjoyed it.\u201d \u2014 Dolly Parton\n\nLast week, Parton stole the show when she took the Grammys stage and was serenaded by goddaughter Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Little Big Town and Kacey Musgraves. Parton said she\u2019s encouraged by the wide range of support for women that has poured into the movement and hopes women can continue to break through the barriers.\n\nKATY PERRY CRITICIZED FOR APPEARING TO TRY AND UPSTAGE DOLLY PARTON DURING GRAMMYS TRIBUTE\n\n\u201cI do think, though that people are more open. I\u2019m hoping that we can get out there and do what we think we couldn\u2019t do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can be a little more aggressive now that we\u2019ve got a little bit more of an open path now. I\u2019m proud to be a woman. I look like a woman, but I think like a man because I do know how men think. I don\u2019t think of it in terms of male or female, I just think of is in terms of getting a job done.\u201d\n\nParton said that despite her many accomplishments in her career, she doesn't like to dole out advice to people because not everyone's trajectory is the same, and in her time crooning with the best of them \u2014 even she doesn't get it right all the time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t try to tell other people what to do. People always say \u2018what kind of advice do you give?' I don\u2019t give people advice,\" she elucidated. \"I have information if you want to know some facts and if you want to know sometimes how I dealt with something, but I do believe everybody has a right to be themselves. Everyone has their own path and their own road to walk, and everybody\u2019s talent is different.\u201d\n\nShe pressed on: \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me to tell them not to do it. Who am I to tell anyone not to do anything. I look like the town tramp \u2014 and that\u2019s how I pattern my look, after the town tramp. So who am I to tell somebody else how to dress or tell anyone what to do? I just live my femininity. People say \u201care you a feminist?' I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know exactly what that means. I\u2019m proud to be a woman. I\u2019m proud to be a woman in business. I\u2019m proud to do what I do. But I like to just live it. I like to be an example.\u201d\n\nAs the Dollywood co-owner was pressed about the prospect of one day seeing a woman president in the Oval Office, Parton said she certainly sees it as a possibility and also noted what traits any female commander in chief would need to possess.\n\n\u201cI think there could be, but she needs to be smart. She needs to know what she\u2019s doing. She don\u2019t need to take it just to prove a point because she\u2019s a woman. She needs to have the goods, she needs to have the knowledge, she needs to have the backbone to run a country. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to have a female president if we don\u2019t really feel like she\u2019s capable of saving the country or saving the world for that matter.\u201d\n\nFox News' Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report."}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/miranda-lambert-husband-brendan-mcloughlin-to-commute-between-nashville-and-new-york-report", "text": "Miranda Lambert and her new husband, Brendan McLoughlin, are going to rack up some serious frequent flier miles together.\n\nGET TO KNOW MIRANDA LAMBERT'S NEW HUSBAND, BRENDAN MCLOUGHLIN\n\nLambert, 35, and McLoughlin, 27, will reportedly commute between Nashville, Tenn., and New York City instead of planting their roots down in one place.\n\nLast week, the \"Tin Man\" singer announced she tied the knot with the NYPD officer.\n\nPHOTOS: MIRANDA LAMBERT'S AMAZING BODY TRANSFORMATION\n\nThe couple will move back and forth between Lambert's 400-acre Tennessee estate and the Big Apple for about a year, TMZ reported late Monday.\n\nSources told the site after that time, McLoughlin, who was recently promoted to sergeant, may leave the force or move to be with his new wife.\n\nMIRANDA LAMBERT ANNOUNCES SHE GOT MARRIED: 'I MET THE LOVE OF MY LIFE'\n\nMeanwhile, a friend of the songstress told People that Lambert and McLoughlin met on Nov. 2, 2018, when she performed on \"Good Morning America\" with her Pistol Annies bandmates.\n\nMcLoughlin is assigned to the NYPD's Midtown South Precinct, which includes Times Square, where \"GMA\" films.\n\nMIRANDA LAMBERT WAS 'FLIPPING PLATES' AT RESTAURANT DURING FIGHT: 911 CALL\n\nThe Pistol Annies had a concert about a block away from the \"GMA\" studios later that night.\n\nA friend of Lambert's gushed that McLoughlin's police work resonated with Lambert, whose father was a homicide-and-narcotics cop for the Dallas Police Department before launching a private detective agency with her mother.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIf you know Miranda\u2019s dad and his background, you can guess why she\u2019d easily connect with Brendan,\u201d the pal said.\n\nSources told the site that the couple tied the knot on Jan. 26.\n\nA rep for Lambert did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment."}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dolly-parton-says-husband-carl-dean-isnt-necessarily-one-of-the-biggest-fans-of-her-music", "text": "Dolly Parton\u2019s music is loved by millions of people, but don\u2019t count her husband Carl Thomas Dean as one of them.\n\nThe \u201cJolene\u201d singer revealed on \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d on Monday that Dean isn\u2019t fawning over her music like other music fans despite being married for 52 years.

He's an NYPD officer.\n\nMiranda Lambert's new man is a boy in blue! Brendan McLoughlin is a New York City police officer in the Midtown South precinct. He's originally from Staten Island, N.Y.\n\n2. He once caught a bank robber.\n\nIt looks like Brendan McLoughlin is great at his job! The NYPD Midtown South precinct congratulated him and a colleague on a job well done in March 2018, writing, \"This week these fine officers showed what we do best in #Midtown. PO McLoughlin apprehended perpetrator in a bank robbery in progress & PO Donato had a pick up arrest of a truck burglary closing out several open complaints.\"\n\n3. He tried his hand at modeling.\n\nMiranda Lambert's ex-husband, Blake Shelton, may have been named Sexiest Man Alive in 2017, but Brendan McLoughlin actually was a model. In 2011, when McLoughlin was just 19 years old, he posed in shirtless snaps for a Model Mayhem page, in which he also specified his measurements: The hunk is 5'11,\" 150 pounds and, importantly, refused to pose nude. He wrote of his style as being \"all american boy/ abercrombie / sporty,\" but added, \"I'm open minded, so feel free to network with me, share your ideas, and organize sessions.\"\n\n4. He's younger than his bride.\n\nBrendan McLoughlin is 27 to Miranda Lambert's 35, making him the youngest man with whom she's been publicly linked \u2014 though she's had a bit of a cougar pattern since her divorce from Blake Shelton. Evan Felker is a year younger at 34, while Anderson East turned 30 after a few months after he and Lambert split in 2018.\n\n5. He's a dog person.\n\nGood news for Miranda Lambert, who has a ton of rescue pooches: Brendan McLoughlin loves dogs almost as much as she does! He's been photographed with adorable NYPD K-9s at events, which probably helped to melt her heart.\n\n6.

The journalist was released Sept. 23, 2014.\n\nWhile the journalist is not named in the complaint or in a superseding indictment, the dates of his capture and release, and several details outlined in the court documents, match the experiences of author Michael Scott Moore, a German-American who was abducted by pirates in Somalia while he was there writing a book about piracy.\n\nMoore's publicist said he was unreachable for an interview Thursday. In November, Moore confirmed to the New York Times that another man indicted in the case, Mohamed Tahlil Mohamed, was one of his captors. Mohamed and Hassan are listed as co-defendants.\n\nAccording to court documents, Hassan, 51, was born in Mogadishu and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He faces six counts, including kidnapping conspiracy, hostage-taking conspiracy and unlawful use of firearms.\n\nHe was arrested in Minneapolis on Friday and will be returned to New York to face charges. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney in New York to comment on his behalf.\n\nThe charging documents say the journalist was in a vehicle on Jan. 21, 2012, in the vicinity of Galkayo when he was surrounded by a group of heavily armed men carrying what appeared to be AK-47 assault rifles and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. He was abducted and struck with weapons, injuring his head and wrist.\n\nHe was taken to different areas in Somalia, and at one point was held in a vessel off the Somali coast. He told investigators that he and another hostage were typically guarded by about 10 men, all armed with assault rifles or belt-fed machine guns. In December 2013, he was moved to a residence near Galkayo, which was frequently visited by Hassan, the complaint says.\n\nThe complaint says Hassan spoke English and was a translator for the hostage takers; the journalist, who identified Hassan from a lineup, said he also appeared to hold a leadership position over the other guards.\n\nMultiple times during the journalist's captivity, Hassan ordered him to call a family member to try to demand more money for ransom. During one call on Jan. 30, 2012, the journalist told a family member that his captors were demanding $20 million \"and that if they did not receive the money within 24 hours, they would stop providing food and water to Victim-1,\" the complaint said.\n\nIn another call in May 2012, the journalist said things had \"gotten very serious\" and another hostage had been tortured in front of him. The journalist said there was a real threat that if the ransom didn't come through, he would be sold to al-Shabab.\n\nIn May 2012, the pirates released a video, showing the journalist in an undisclosed location with a prayer shawl over his head, surrounded by masked kidnappers who pointed a machine gun and rocket-propelled grenade at him.\n\nThe journalist was released in September 2014. Moore has said his family raised $1.6 million for his release.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Hassan entered the U.S. in New York on Sept. 15, 2015, and was interviewed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He allegedly said he worked as the Minister of the Interior and Security for Galmudug State in Somalia, which includes Galkayo, and his job included arranging for the release of kidnapped people, including the journalist.\n\n___\n\nFollow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/document-man-accused-of-attacking-officer-asked-to-be-shot", "text": "An Islamic State follower asked a Phoenix-area sheriff's sergeant during a violent encounter six weeks ago to shoot him after he threw rocks at the officer and walked toward him with a knife in hand, according to a court document authorities were forced to release Wednesday.\n\nThe probable-cause statement from the investigation of Ismail Hamed was released after The Associated Press and other news organizations protested an effort by Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery's office to keep videos and other records from the Jan. 7 attack under seal.

Top Chef alum Shirley Chung shares tips with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo on turning out the tastiest dumplings and other lucky Lunar New Year foods. Listen Here:\n\nJIAOZI WITH CHICKEN FILLING\n\nAccording to Chinese legend, jiaozi was invented thousands of years ago by an Emperor's doctor during a cold winter. That winter was so cold, lots of poor peoples' ears were falling off and many of them were getting sick. So, the doctor begged the Emperor to give him some flour, and then he went around collecting mutton trims from the rich families. The doctor made jiaozi dumplings folded in an ear shape and filled with mutton and herbal medicines, and then he fed the poor of the whole city. Jiaozi became a staple dish to make when guests come to visit, during the Chinese New Year celebration, when kids go back to visit mom . . . The Chinese show their love through these dumplings. Lots of people get intimidated by folding dumplings--don't be. They don't have to be perfect: just seal them with filling inside, or use a dumpling folder. Don't miss out on this deliciousness!\n\nSERVES 4\n\nJiaozi Wrapper 4 cups (480 g) all-purpose flour 1\u00bc cups (300 ml) water 1 tsp salt\n\nChicken Filling 1 lb (450 g) ground chicken 4 tbsp (60 ml) oyster sauce 4 tbsp (60 ml) soy sauce 4 tbsp (60 ml) chicken stock 1 large egg 1 tbsp (15 ml) sesame oil 2 tbsp (14 g) minced ginger \u00bd cup (50 g) minced green onions\n\nFor Serving Black vinegar Chili oil\n\nTools to Help You Dough mixer Pasta roller 3-inch (8-cm) cookie cutter Dumpling folder\n\nJiaozi Wrapper Combine the flour, water and salt in a mixer. Knead until it forms a smooth dough, and rest it for 30 minutes. In my house, after the dough has rested, I will portion it into bottle cap-size balls (about 7 grams each), then individually roll them out into small rounds with a rolling pin to make wrappers. Alternatively, you can run the dough through a pasta roller. Roll them to #4 thickness, then use a 3-inch (8-cm) cookie cutter to cut out round wrappers.\n\nChicken Filling Put the ground chicken in a medium-size mixing bowl. Combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce and chicken stock together in a cup. Slowly pour this liquid into the ground chicken while stirring, until all the liquid absorbs into the meat. Next add the egg and sesame oil, and mix well. After all the seasoning is mixed into the chicken, add the ginger and green onions, and mix well. It's ready for folding.\n\nDumplings Using a dumpling folder, if you'd like, take 1 wrapper and 1 tablespoon (15 g) of chicken filling per dumpling. Place the filling in the middle of the wrapper, close the edges and make them into an ear shape (half- moon shape). After all the jiaozi are folded, boil water in a large pot. Add the jiaozi in when the water is boiling. When the water returns to a boil, add \u00bd cup (120 ml) of cold water, and bring back to a boil. When all the jiaozi are floating on top of the water, they are done. Enjoy them hot with some black vinegar and chili oil.\n\nWHOLE STEAMED RED SNAPPER\n\nSteamed whole fish is the staple of any Chinese celebration feast. Fish symbolize prosperity, luck and opportunities in our culture. My version is extra exciting, with bean sprouts tossed in and Doubanjiang to add texture and spice. The aged soy sauce brings in more umami, and the final pour of hot oil over the steamed fish will push the aroma to overdrive. You want to source the freshest fish to steam. Make sure the gills are bright red, the eyeballs are clear and the flesh bounces back when you press it. If a whole fish freaks you out a little bit, you can always steam a fish fillet; just drop the cooking time to 4 to 5 minutes. Don't worry, prosperity won't run away from you. Decode the special meaning behind this dish: Bean sprouts represent growth, and fish represents prosperity and wealth. Eat this dish, and you will grow your wealth.\n\nSERVES 6\n\n1\u00bd lb (675 g) whole red snapper, cleaned, scaled and gutted Salt and white pepper, to taste 1 oz (28 g) bean sprouts 1 tsp Doubanjiang chili paste 1 tbsp (15 ml) Shaoxing wine 2 thinly sliced green onions, divided 1 tsp sesame oil 1 tbsp (7 g) thinly sliced ginger 1 red Fresno chili, thinly sliced, seeds removed 4 tbsp (60 ml) aged soy sauce (I like Wan Ja Shan brand) 4 tbsp (60 ml) canola oil\n\nTools Stainless steel or bamboo steamer that is big enough to fit the whole fish A large plate that fits in the steamer and holds the fish\n\nFill the bottom of the steamer with water and start boiling the water. Score the fish 3 times on each side for even cooking. Rub the inside and the outside of snapper with salt and pepper, and set aside.\n\nIn a small mixing bowl, toss the bean sprouts with the Doubanjiang, Shaoxing wine, 1 pinch of sliced green onions and the sesame oil, and season to taste with salt. Stuff the snapper with the seasoned bean sprouts. Place a few slices of ginger on the flesh of the fish, and place the fish on a plate for steaming. Steam the stuffed whole snapper over high heat in the steamer for 8 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, toss the sliced Fresno chili pepper and the rest of the green onions together. Heat up the soy sauce in a small saucepan, simmer for 1 minute and turn of the heat. This cooked soy sauce is part of the sauce for the steamed fish.\n\nWhen the fish is finished steaming, take it out of the steamer an d place on a serving dish. Drizzle the soy sauce all over the fish, and place an even layer of green onions and Fresno chili on the steamed fish. In a small saut\u00e9 pan, heat up the cooking oil until smoking hot and then pour the hot oil over the green onions on the fish. You can smell the caramelized soy sauce and onion aroma.\n\nReprinted with permission from Chinese Heritage Cooking from My American Kitchen by Shirley Chung, Page Street Publishing Co. 2018.

But he's focused and that's what we needed the president to get this work done.\n\nKILMEADE: All right (ph) it's just amazing because McCabe, who's launched the investigation and he's proud of it, believes that there's an excellent chance that the president of the United States is a Russian asset, working for Vladimir Putin.\n\nMCCARTHY: That is so - every time one of these individuals is fired because of their own problems, they go out and do a book deal, they look dumber with each interview that they go through.\n\nAnd it's like Comey, now McCabe, it just shows how these individuals tried to run a whole coup on our country and how inept they are - lies and they get caught up in all their own (inaudible).\n\nKILMEADE: Yes, I mean they are caught up in it, and they don't agree with each other.

I'm just astounded by every time there's something about their behavior that's questioned, they don't remember.\n\nBut there's something in question that they believe the president's done wrong, they can remember verbatim like it was yesterday.

But it just seems to me once again McCabe just going to some other extreme.\n\nI mean listen, this guy, he doesn't understand why the other players in this don't have the same memory that he has, but that's OK. And somehow when you go through all these individuals, Comey (ph) and others, they only take notes when they're with the president, but any other time they're with anybody else they never do.\n\nI just - they're not credible to any of their statements.\n\nKILMEADE: Well is this true, what Trey Gowdy said yesterday, cut 14 (ph).\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nTREY GOWDY, FORMER CONGRESSMAN: That Devin and Paul knew about it, had no problem with it, that's exactly what he's getting at and the reason he's doing it this way is Devin and Paul are not allowed to discuss anything that is said in a Gang of Eight meeting, and McCabe knows that.\n\nSo he can level the accusation and Paul and Devin cannot refute him.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nIs that true?\n\nMCCARTHY: Yes, listen. There's a reason why you have a Gang of Eight, there's a reason why people can brief you on a lot of different information, but for somebody - just think of his character.\n\nHe - here he is, former acting FBI director, going out in a short amount of time. If he truly believes what he says, why would he ever disrupt the Mueller investigation? Why would he ever say anything?\n\nIf he is true to his belief that he is in the (ph) (inaudible) - we all know former FBI members that have worked there, they don't talk about what went on. Those who go and talk about something, nine times out of 10, it's not true.\n\nAnd they know in a Gang of Eight no one is going to say anything whether it's true or false what - what happens and what's talked about inside a Gang of Eight meeting.\n\nKILMEADE: So if you're in a Gang of Eight now and you hear an FBI director doing something what he - deputy director, saying what - something he said, and I asked you what happened, you would have to say Brian, I cant tell you.\n\nMCCARTHY: Yes, I don't -\n\n(CROSS TALK)\n\nKILMEADE: So why is it OK for him to do it? Why is it OK for him to talk about it and he was there?\n\nMCCARTHY: It's not OK for him to talk about it, but it goes to what Trey is trying to convey to you. He - he says something because he knows people in that situation cannot refute him.\n\nSo he tries to put a falsity trying to make it real.\n\nKILMEADE: I got to bring you to -\n\nMCCARTHY: It goes to his character as a former acting FBI director to talk about anything. He's doing this for money and he's trying to be sensationalist (ph) as he can to sell more books, the same thing Comey did on his book tour, and the more he spoke, the more discredited he became.\n\nKILMEADE: All right, a couple of things I want to talk about. The president's also taking on the governor in your state because he got $3 billion to build a high speed train, not from this president but from a previous president, and one of the first things Gavin Newsom said is it's not working, it's over budget, I'm not building it.\n\nAnd now the president said give me the money back then, and he said no this is all a coincidence. It's a coincidence - it's no coincidence that the day after I'm suing - I joined 15 other governors in suing you for using the emergency declaration at the border, now you want your money back.\n\nWhat do you have to say about this battle between the governor and the president?\n\nMCCARTHY: Look, I've been with - with our governor and with this president, I've watched them work together when it was the fires and others and the president lead (ph). Even though they'll have difference of opinion, but to - to make the accusation that somehow the president is now asking for money back because he's suing, no.\n\nGavin Newsom, the governor of California, and I - he's half right, that high speed rail was never high speed, it put a bond of $10 billion, it was (ph) going in a patient (ph) that it could not sustain itself.\n\nIt was more than $100 billion, it was overdrawn, he should stop the whole thing. So there's still roughly a little less than $1 billion of federal money, well if it's not going to be built, why would you spend that federal money on that?\n\nSo what the president is doing, like he should do, looking at all the entities. If there's places we can say, if you're not going to build it, why would you throw money down something that's not going to happen?\n\nI personally think there would be a better use of that money, because that's transportation money, reallocated in California for our highways, or also reallocate it, we have a water issue out there.\n\nI think that would be the best use of the money, those are things federal government should do. But it has nothing to do with the other.\n\nKILMEADE: Well I'm going to tell you what the president just tweeted, California now wants to scale back their already failed fast train project by substantially shortening the distance that it no longer goes from L.A. to San Francisco.\n\nAnd by the way, to San Diego it was supposed to go I thought. A different deal and a record cost overrun, send the federal government back its money. And you're saying well - acknowledge that you're not using it for that, but try to get it regranted towards something else California needs, right?\n\nMCCARTHY: Yes, what I would do if I was Governor Gavin Newsom, and I'll talk to the president about this, this is transportation money that was allocated for the transportation needs of California.\n\nThey are no longer going to do the high speed rail, so why should the federal government put anymore money into that? But there are still transportation needs in California, so why don't you reallocate that money?\n\nWe have a highway problem, we have a water issue, that's infrastructure. Reallocate it there, that is a better use, not a waste of tax dollars, and it shouldn't go to a - to a rail that's not going to be high speed, that's not going to be built. That would be a waste of $1 billion.\n\nKILMEADE: So I understand politics and I understand you got to put the other guy down to be successful, Barack Obama to Mitt Romney, we saw that for two years. But I don't understand why Sherrod Brown and Bernie Sanders have one thing in common, the most despicable ways to describe the president humanly possible. Cut 31.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I think the current argument (ph) of the White House is an embarrassment to our country, I think he is a pathological liar every day, he is telling one lie or another.\n\nAnd it gives me no pleasure to say that, but I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nI'm just astounded why that's not - that's acceptable.\n\nMCCARTHY: You know, our country is too divided. How many of us have lost friends, not because anything we've done with our friendship because one party won one election and another party lost another.\n\nKILMEADE: Yes.\n\nMCCARTHY: We - we are - we are better than this as Americans. We can have differences of opinion, but one thing that we know our own government is designed to do is supply (ph) compromise.\n\nYou do not win an election just because you tear somebody else down, tell us what you're for, tell us what you're going to do. If you don't like our tax system, Bernie, if you want to make it 80 percent, then tell the American public that and let the American public decide at the end of the day.\n\nBut I really - what I want to have happen here, when the election is over, the election should be over and we should be able to govern. But when you look at people like Tom Steyer and -- who just wants to impeach the president for the sake of impeachment.\n\nThey just continue to drive and the worst part of the human nature to do things like this, this is actually what other countries want to have happen in America. I mean it goes to your number one issue - story that you had today.\n\nYou know, about an individual that's making up a story that goes to the worst elements of America, right, about racism and others. Well that just drives the issue further and that's what's wrong, and this is what they're going on. They're going on the worst elements of individuals trying to make an election based upon just tearing another person down.\n\nLet's stop talking about what we're for and make a decision what we want America to look like for the next four or six years.\n\nKILMEADE: That would be interesting because I just - I just cannot imagine Ronald Reagan or - or Bill Clinton or George Bush - as bad as they were with Bush, they were never this bad.\n\nI mean it's just accepted now you're going to call the president a racist. But a couple of things, looking at your party, a lot of responsibility is going to go on your shoulders, I read the Politico stories of all places that the president has set up a pretty big machine to get re-elected.\n\nBrad Pescow (ph) in 2020 has assembled corporate offices, got 30 department heads including people that he knows he can trust like Marc Lotter, 30 full time staffers on digital data, assembling a surrogate network.\n\nThey expect to have 100 people full time by the end of the year and they're overseeing field deployments across the country. The RNC has invested $10 million already that usually goes to the midterms.\n\nNow what do you need for Republicans to be successful in the House, especially in your state?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well first of all, the number one thing you have to do is recruitment. I'll tell you, I happen to be travelling this week, I'll be in California back to my district tomorrow.\n\nBut I was in Houston last night to (inaudible) we lost the Democrats, I was talking to this individual, he had - he went to West Point, his sister went to West Point, his brother went to West Point, his name is Wesley Hunt (ph).\n\nHe flew Apache helicopters, he comes out, he works in the business community, he and his wife just have a brand new baby, a 10 day old daughter, it's his biggest excitement. But he watched the country change before his eyes.\n\nNow this is a suburban area, he understands this issue well. He is an individual that I think would be really well served in this. So when I'm going across the country finding individuals who are willing to serve their country, and do you know the thing that I find that some of these very best people to run, this isn't going to be the highest paying job, they're going to take a pay cut.\n\nThey're going to have to put their family through something much tougher. And this is the basis that you want to feel (ph) people that - who want to serve. And the first thing we got to do is find the right candidates in the right districts to represent their districts.\n\nKILMEADE: You've got to go - I guess go recruit in your state because New York and California got beat up pretty bad, and you might have an opportunity in Virginia after the corruption that we're seeing there that's an embarrassment to the - the whole country with three Democrats, right?\n\nMCCARTHY: Why are the top three in Virginia still in power?\n\nKILMEADE: Don't know, don't know.\n\nMCCARTHY: Why doesn't their own Democratic Party rise up? We've watched it within our own party, and I will tell you, Brian, I had to make a hard decision when I saw what Steve King had said, I can't remove him from office but I can take him off committees.\n\nBut when I watch what Nancy Pelosi does with Omar when she says those anti-Semitic comments, they don't remove her from foreign affairs. You know what they do? They keep her in committee and they said she just has to apologize.\n\nKILMEADE: Don't worry she's - Farrakhan's got her back, so it's no problem.\n\nMCCARTHY: But that is what's wrong, that is not acceptable in this country.\n\nKILMEADE: I got to ask you something else, Kevin, I'm going to put you in an odd spot but I hope you can answer honestly. The president did not mention Paul Ryan's name, but he mentioned how disappointed he was that for two straight budgets, so the Speaker Ryan's House did not give him money more than $1.3 billion or $1.6 billion for a wall that he ran on to the point where he had to shut down the government to make a Democratic House do something and we end up in the mess we're in right now.\n\nDo you actually look at Republican leadership, which you are a part of, and did you guys let the president down?\n\nMCCARTHY: No, no. This is a - look at what the facts are, it was the House that passed the appropriation bill with $5 billion.\n\nKILMEADE: And in a desperation move, you went back and did the impossible, but why'd it get to that point?\n\nMCCARTHY: We - it takes 218 to pass, but what I think the American public and your listeners have to understand, in the Senate it takes 60 votes. It wasn't the president who shut down the government, it's Schumer.\n\nSchumer is the one who sat back and would not pass anything. Schumer is the one that they have the power when they need another eight votes to go forward, it was the House that passed repeal and replace of Obamacare.\n\nIt was the Senate that came one vote short, it was the House that wrote the tax bill that passed and went over, it was the House that produced the appropriation bills. So I mean when you sit down and look at history, this is probably one of the most productive Houses we've found.\n\nUnfortunately, we judge it all about Washington and in Washington, the Senate takes 60. So everybody sits back there and the Democrats say oh you had the White House, you had Congress and you had the Senate.\n\nYes we did, but we don't have the rule, why wouldn't the president have all of his appointments yet? Because in the Senate, they hold all that time up, it is the Democrats that are making this impossible.\n\nKILMEADE: One of the most powerful Republicans in the country, Kevin McCarthy, thanks so much for your time.\n\nMCCARTHY: Thank you, Brian.\n\nKILMEADE: You got it."}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://radio.foxnews.com/2019/02/20/the-whip-around-02-20-2019/", "text": "Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders made the big announcement Tuesday that he is running for President, but will he be able to generate the same level of support he found in 2016?

I\u2019ve been playing sports since I could walk.\n\nI trained at two of the three Olympic Training Centers for volleyball, then went on to play sand volleyball at USC.\n\nIn my free time, I love to do basketball trick shots and go to \"Dave & Busters\" to play Pop-a-Shot.\n\n4. My family is the most important thing in my life\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be anywhere without the support of my parents and two brothers.\n\nMy parents have been married for 32 years (33 in June) and are a couple to look up to. One of my brothers, Ryan, attended Notre Dame, while my other brother, Tyler, and I went to USC, so there\u2019s a huge football rivalry in the family!\n\nWe are extremely close and do a lot of things together.\n\n5. My favorite store is Home Depot.\n\nYou can always find me in the PVC pipe aisle. There are so many things you can make. My go-to is a marshmallow launcher. I use the saw to make various lengths of PVC pipe and put them together with different sized connectors. Home Depot is the Happiest Place on Earth!\n\nAnd here\u2019s a bonus fun fact: I\u2019ve never eaten a PB&J.\n\nSee More \"5 Things You Didn't Know\"...\n\nJesse Watters\n\nPete Hegseth\n\nTomi Lahren\n\nBritt McHenry\n\nTyrus"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/02/07/jesse-watters-5-things-you-didnt-know-facts-photos", "text": "Fox News Insider ventured into the world of Jesse Watters to learn more about the Fox News host.\n\nRead on to see some fun facts about the Philly native's musical side, his family's political leanings and his new pup, Rookie.\n\nDid you know you can now access a library of Jesse's favorite \"Watters' World\" segments?

I was a flautist.\n\nFrom fourth-grade to 11th-grade, I played the flute.\n\nMy mom and dad used to make me perform for family members at holidays and I played in school recitals.\n\nI took lessons once-a-week after sports practices. I also played football, lacrosse, basketball and was on the wrestling and swimming teams.\n\n2. I recently became a dog owner for the first time.\n\nI named him Rookie because he's my first dog. Rookie is a mini poodle. I love him and he\u2019s a genius \u2013 he\u2019s already trained!\n\nI was never a dog or animal person, but now I'm a total dog lover.\n\n3. I have a huge sweet tooth.\n\nMy favorites are pretty much anything with chocolate in it, Oreos, ice cream and Key lime pie. But I do not bake.\n\n4. I\u2019ve been to almost every state in the U.S.\n\nAs Fox News viewers know, I've traveled across the country for \"Watters' World\" segments over the years. I've been to 48 out of our 50 states.\n\nThe only states I\u2019m missing are North Dakota and Alaska.\n\nOne of my favorite spots in the United States is Big Sur in California.\n\nIt's a really beautiful part of the country.\n\n5. My entire family is liberal.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen the \"Texts From Mom\" segment on The Five, you know my mom, Dr. Anne Watters, is a huge liberal and she regularly sends me texts with criticism of my on-air commentary.\n\nMy dad, Stephen Watters, is also a Democrat, as is my sister, who's a professor.\n\nMy uncle, David Watters, is a Democratic State Senator in New Hampshire.\n\nSee more \"5 Things You Didn't Know\"...\n\nPete Hegseth\n\nTyrus\n\nBritt McHenry\n\nTrish Regan\n\nAinsley Earhardt\n\nTomi Lahren"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/01/03/pete-hegseth-5-things-you-didnt-know-facts-photos", "text": "Fox News Insider caught up with Fox Nation contributor and \"Fox & Friends\" anchor Pete Hegseth to learn more about his life outside of Fox News.\n\nRead on for details about Pete's sharpshooting (on the basketball court), his favorite place to travel and where you're most likely to see him out with his kids...\n\n1) I played (briefly) in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nMy dad was a high school basketball coach, so I spent the first 20 years of my life doing almost nothing other than playing hoops. Early-morning workouts, organizing full-court games and spending summers at camps, I loved basketball. (I once also made 230 free throws in a row in the driveway. I only missed one after stopping to get a drink of water).\n\nI led my high school team to the Minnesota state tournament, and set the school record for career three-pointers. My younger brother later broke my record (but only because they ran a run-and-gun offense!).\n\nI went on to play four years at Princeton University. I didn't play much, but I did get on the floor in an NCAA Tournament game in 2001. We were a 15-seed and lost to the #2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels.\n\nI committed a foul in the last minute of the game, so my name is in the official scorebook.\n\n2) My tattoos honor the United States and our military.\n\nI wanted a tattoo for years and got my first one in 2017. That one is a secret, but I quickly added four more, expressing my love of faith, country and service and I'm not done yet!\n\nOne depicts the coat of arms of the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, the Army unit in which I served. Another says \"We the People.\"\n\nTake a look...\n\n3) I wrote a book in 2016, and shockingly, wrote all 304 pages myself!\n\nFollowing my deployments to Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan -- and after extensive time in Washington, D.C., advocating success in the Iraq War and fixing the Department of Veterans Affairs -- I felt like I might have something to say. So, I wrote a book. It took me about six months in 2015, as I worked on it mostly from 4am to 8am each day before going to work. I wrote it as a call-to-arms to reignite American citizenship at home and restore American power abroad, using Teddy Roosevelt's famous \"Man in the Arena\" speech as inspiration.\n\nIn order to save America for the next generation, I believe we need to raise gritty kids who love their country and are willing to fight for what they believe in. I was not originally a Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign (initially I was for Marco Rubio, and then Ted Cruz), but the book hits on many of the same themes as our current President. It's no surprise, therefore, that I want to Make America Great Again.\n\n4) I love to travel to Israel.\n\nIn the past few years, I have had the opportunity -- and honor -- to travel to Israel four times. Each time, my connection to the Jewish State and the holy city of Jerusalem deepened. The history, the religious significance, the conflict and the gravity of Israel are like nowhere else in the world. The United States has long had a special bond with the State of Israel and I hope to help continue that, with a recognition that Israel is, in many ways, the furthest-most outpost of Western civilization.\n\nIsrael is surrounded by countries and terrorist groups that want to wipe it off the map. Not only has it survived, but it has triumphed and thrived, a testament to the fortitude of God's chosen people. I plan to visit Israel as much as I can in the future, hopefully with my kids and family. If you haven't been to Jerusalem, you have to go!\n\nP.S. - I recently conducted a sit-down interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for Fox Nation! Sign up for a free trial today to see more exclusive content from me and your favorite Fox News personalities.\n\n5) Bowling with my kids is one of my favorite things.\n\nI bowled sparingly as a kid, but in the past few years I have found it to be an excellent way to entertain, engage, and feed (!) my kids. I mean, what's better than fun, friendly, family competition, copious amounts of lemonade and beer (for the adults) and bowling alley pizza?!\n\nI used to think bowling was only for birthday parties and special occasions, but now it's a regular activity. Not all of my kids like bowling as much as I do, though I'm working on them with the fire of a Baptist preacher. I bowl a lot, but I'm still proud when I crack 100. The only thing I've mastered about bowling is the art of the celebration! If you're ever bowling in Minnesota, New Jersey or New York, don't be surprised if you see me and my family in a lane near you.\n\n5 Things You Didn't Know About...\n\nTyrus\n\nBritt McHenry\n\nTrish Regan\n\nAinsley Earhardt\n\nTomi Lahren"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://insider.foxnews.com/2018/11/19/tyrus-5-things-you-didnt-know-about-fox-nation-host-greg-gutfeld-show-favorite", "text": "Fox News Insider caught up with Tyrus, the \"Greg Gutfeld Show\" fan-favorite who will be one of the stars of Fox Nation.\n\nThe subscription-based streaming service debuts on November 27, featuring daily shows like \"UN-PC,\" which Tyrus will host each day at 6:00pm ET alongside Britt McHenry.\n\nRead on to find out more about Tyrus and learn more about becoming a Fox Nation founding member.\n\n1. Tyrus played college football at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, later trying out for the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills and the CFL's Toronto Argonauts.\n\nHe went on to play arena football for a couple years and once ruptured his appendix while playing for the Charleston Swamp Foxes.\n\n2. Tyrus was once a bodyguard for Snoop Dogg.\n\nHe got the gig after Snoop's bodyguard witnessed him deftly deal with an unruly patron while he was working security at a Los Angeles club.\n\nHe and Snoop bonded over their shared love of football, and Tyrus started coaching in Snoop's youth football league.\n\n\"Snoop's a pretty basic guy,\" Tyrus said. \"He's a very humble dude. He's not stuck on himself. That's one thing I love about Snoop. He's a real dude.\"\n\n3. Tyrus worked for years as a professional wrestler and performed around the world. He may be familiar to WWE fans because of his Brodus Clay persona.\n\nHe was discovered by WWE's head of talent during a chance encounter at the Los Angeles club where he worked during the weekend of WrestleMania XX in 2004.\n\nHe said his favorite part of pro wrestling was \"stealing the crowd\" and making them a part of the show.\n\nTyrus once gifted Kat Timpf with his action figure for her birthday on a recent \"Gutfeld Show.\"\n\n4. Tyrus and Greg Gutfeld first connected on Twitter.\n\n\"It's an old love story,\" Tyrus joked, revealing that he liked several of Gutfeld's tweets, which led to them following each other.\n\nThey started communicating and Gutfeld eventually invited Tyrus to come on the show as a guest.\n\n5. Tyrus went viral a few years ago for urging compliance with police officers amid Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\"When I'm compliant, nothing bad is going to happen to me. It's not my moment to resist arrest, and when everyone videotapes me resisting arrest and being taken down, that's where bad things happen,\" Tyrus said. \"That doesn't make me Rosa Parks. That makes me a criminal. And it has nothing to do with color.\"\n\nGutfeld suggested that the segment helped the show achieve success, noting that the audience \"doubled in size\" shortly after.\n\nMore 5 Things You Didn't Know...\n\nAinsley Earhardt\n\nBritt McHenry\n\nTrish Regan\n\nTomi Lahren\n\nJudge Jeanine"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://insider.foxnews.com/2018/11/07/deirdre-bolton-fox-business-anchor-5-things-you-didnt-know", "text": "Fox News Insider caught up with Fox Business Network's Deirdre Bolton, the host of a brand-new series of FBN specials called \"Women & Money.\"\n\nRead on to find out more about the native Pennsylvanian and don't miss \"Women & Money\" on Fox Business Network.\n\n1. I grew up in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and it is still one of my favorite places to go. I have lived all over the world, but Newtown is still very much \"home\" to me.\n\nWhile I was growing up, working farms were alive and well. I remember my mom and I used to buy milk from one of the local farmers, filling our own glass jugs from the farmer's steel tanks. We paid by leaving cash in a cigar box in the barn.\n\n2. I am happiest outdoors and with animals. I had a big, furry Bernese Mountain Dog as a childhood companion; I still miss her!\n\nNow I live in New York City (thankfully near a park) with my family, including our dog Rocky, a little white poodle mix.\n\n3. When I was a child, I was a competitive swimmer, which is funny because I am not tall but I spent a lot of time in the water from ages 9 to 17.\n\nI grew gills instead of inches. Here I am after winning a race with short swimmers' hair!\n\n(I always cut my hair short after the summer season because the chlorine made my hair so brittle.)\n\n4. I started my professional career on Wall Street, working on an international equities desk. I sold European Equities to American institutional investors for French banks. I liked my job, but I didn't love it. I pitched myself to Bloomberg to write for their magazine. It turned out they needed an NYSE reporter, not a magazine writer at that time. I gave it a shot, did a screen test on the stock exchange floor and was hired shortly thereafter.\n\nSince then, I have covered the markets - from the NYSE to the NASDAQ - been a field reporter and created and hosted my own shows. As part of all those experiences I have covered numerous world and national news events that became very personal. I was on the NYSE trading floor on the morning of the 9/11 attacks. I remember being led to the basement for safety and seeing traders trying to reach family members, others holding back tears and so many more steadying themselves. It is a day I will never forget.\n\nIn November 2015, I also reported extensively from Paris after the terror attacks.\n\n5. My mother is the person who has had the most positive influence in my life. Every day, I think about her, and my luck to have had her in my life, as MY mom. She had lifelong health problems and that never slowed her down. She accomplished more in her life than most people given the gift of health do.\n\nHer illnesses made her push herself harder and farther. As a young person, she traveled the world teaching English on almost every continent and she was a big part of my wanting to experience life in other places. I went to school in Lyon, France and later, Paris, where I also worked, in addition to London and Singapore. My mother was also an avid reader; she pushed herself to keep learning almost to her last day.\n\nMy mother instilled in me the importance of taking responsibility for managing my money and my legal matters. She gave me very basic advice that I follow to this day: never sign any paperwork without understanding it and ask as many questions as it takes. More than a few financial advisors tried to tell my mom she didn't know what she was doing (she did) and tried to sell her products she was not interested in. She was always polite and always stood her ground.\n\nMy mom was a big fan of Louis Rukeyser's \"Wall Street Week\" TV show (which Maria Bartiromo has now taken over!).\n\nIt is partly in my mother's honor and her memory that I am so excited to create and launch \"Women & Money with Deirdre Bolton\" on Fox Business Network.\n\nMore 5 Things You Didn't Know...\n\nAinsley Earhardt\n\nTrish Regan\n\nJudge Jeanine\n\nMelissa Francis"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/02/19/greg-gutfeld-sanders-ripping-schultz-billionaire-status-2020-run", "text": "Greg Gutfeld and the panel on \"The Five\" reacted to Sen.

Once you do that, it's really not all that difficult ... to screen it out of your coverage,\" he explained.\n\nHume said on the morning after the State of the Union address, the Washington Post's website banner described President Trump as making a \"discordant\" call for unity.\n\n\"That's an opinion,\" Hume pointed out, noting the first line of the story described the address as \"dissonant.\"\n\nHume said it's fine to have opinion columnists and an editorial page to offer criticism of the speech, but straight news stories now contain far too much opinion from the reporters.\n\n\"All the restraints seem to be coming off now. It's no accident that the media is at its lowest level in public opinion that anyone can remember,\" he said.\n\nHume caused a stir over the weekend when he criticized political reporters who had helped presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) pick out a jacket during a South Carolina campaign stop and then tweeted out the video.\n\nThis is just embarrassing. So now journalists are going shopping with Harris, helping pick out clothes and then putting out glowing tweets about it. https://t.co/RX2IY0B8JL \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) February 16, 2019\n\nHe said the \"chummy\" behavior by the reporters was \"obviously inappropriate\" and would never happen if they were with a conservative candidate.\n\n\"And the fact that the journalists involved and lots of others defended it, shows you how far down this road we have gotten,\" said Hume.\n\nWatch the clip above.

The mainstream media rushed to keep up. The Trump Internet pounced\n\n\"Above all, they pounce. According to The Times and The Post, Republicans are compulsive pouncers. Fangs bared, claws extended, they leap with feline precision and devour, they can't help themselves,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in January, the Times described Republicans as \"pouncing\" on Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) for her vow to impeach President Trump.\n\nCarlson noted that conservatives \"pounced\" on a Vatican power struggle last summer, while Hillary Clinton is said to have \"endured multiple Republican pounces and lived to tell the tale.\"\n\n\"Barack Obama, too. His eight years in Washington amounted to a single uninterrupted Republican pounce! Imagine the horror of that. No wonder you don't see him much anymore. He's still recovering,\" Carlson joked.\n\nThe Times even wrote of Republicans \"pouncing\" in 1933 against Democrats and FDR.\n\n\"Pouncing then, pouncing now.

The national media long ago gave up the pretense of gathering news. Journalism is now explicitly a political job. The point is to enforce cultural orthodoxies and punish enemies. Jussie Smollett was the perfect vehicle for both,\" said Carlson.\n\nHe asked why the national media has focused relatively little attention on the nearly 3,000 shootings that occurred in Chicago last year, where Smollett claimed he was assaulted.\n\n\"None of Chicago's 3,000 shootings were even half as useful as Smollett's story,\" said Carlson.\n\nWebb on Reaction to Jussie Smollett Claims: 'It's About Pushing a Narrative'\n\nCarlson likened the story to the false claim of rape by a teenager named Tawana Brawley in 1987. Flanked by Rev. Al Sharpton, 15-year-old Brawley claimed a group of white men raped her, put her in a trash bag and scrawled racial slurs on her body.\n\nCarlson noted that the allegations dominated national headlines for a year and stoked tensions along racial lines in New York City. Though Sharpton was ordered by a judge to pay damages for advancing the hoax, his career gradually ascended, Carlson explained.\n\nAccording to visitor logs, Sharpton visited the Obama White House more than 80 times and now has a show on MSNBC, while never apologizing or acknowledging the harm of the Brawley hoax.\n\n\"Hate hoaxes make ethnic groups fear and distrust each other. That is a dangerous thing to do in a country that is becoming more diverse by the day,\" said Carlson.\n\nWatch the full monologue above and learn more about the Brawley case in the Fox Nation documentary \"Scandalous: The Mysterious Case of Tawana Brawley.\" Sign up for a free trial on Fox Nation to watch the show and much more!\n\n'He Stained the League': Tomi Lahren on Colin Kaepernick's Settlement With NFL\n\nRush: 2020 Dem Race Will Be 'Very Entertaining' as 'They Try to Out-Extreme Each Other'"}, {"source": "fox", "url": "https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/02/19/lindsey-graham-mccabe-rosenstein-25th-amendment-talk-one-most-significant-moments-history", "text": "Sen.
