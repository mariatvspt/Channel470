Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was visibly angered as he condemned Smollett\u2019s actions.\n\nPolice did not spell out how the 36-year-old actor hoped to boost his salary by staging such a hoax.\n\n\u201cSmollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,\u201d Johnson told a news conference, adding that the actor paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the supposed hate crime.\n\n\u201cThis stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with this salary. He concocted a story about being attacked,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe gave him the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\nPolice did not say how much Smollett is paid for his role on \u201cEmpire.\u201d If convicted, he could face a prison sentence of one to three years.\n\nA judge set bail at $100,000 and ordered Smollett to surrender his passport. The actor, who turned himself in early on Thursday, was released from jail after paying 10 percent of the bail amount as stipulated by the judge.\n\nIn court, Smollett wore a black jacket and stared at the prosecutor as she detailed the allegations against him.\n\nA spokesman for Smollett\u2019s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said in an email, \u201cOnce we are ready to make statement we will do so.\u201d On Wednesday, the lawyers had said they were conducting a thorough investigation to form an aggressive defense.\n\nSmollett had claimed that two masked men struck him and put a noose round his neck while shouting \u201cThis is MAGA country,\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan.

He led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes out of 282,717 ballots cast on Nov. 6, but elections officials refused to certify him the winner because of allegations of irregularities in the vote.\n\nThe pastor capitulated after his son testified he had warned his father of potential illegal activity by Republican political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless.\n\nNorth Carolina law requires that a new primary nominating election also be conducted in the district, which covers parts of Charlotte and the southeast of the state.

Harris said Dowless assured him he would not collect the ballots from the voters, which would violate state law.\n\nBut residents of at least two counties in the district said Dowless and his paid workers collected incomplete absentee ballots and, in some instances, falsely signed as witnesses and filled in votes for contests left blank, according to testimony at the hearing.\n\nHarris campaign officials said they did not pay Dowless to do anything illegal, and Dowless maintained his innocence."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-stone/judge-tightens-gag-order-on-ex-trump-adviser-stone-warning-he-could-be-jailed-idUSKCN1QA2OZ", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A visibly angry judge on Thursday ordered President Donald Trump\u2019s former political adviser Roger Stone to stop speaking publicly about U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s criminal case against him or else he will be sent to jail pending trial.\n\nIn a tense court hearing on Thursday, U.S. Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said that Stone\u2019s apology and explanations for why he posted a photo of her next to the image of the crosshairs of a gun on his Instagram account were not credible.\n\nJackson made her ruling after a highly unusual hearing in which Stone, who is charged with crimes related to Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, took the stand to testify about the posting.\n\nStone\u2019s seemingly contradictory statements and at times foggy recollections about the post\u2019s origins during a cross-examination by the government frustrated Jackson, who later concluded he \u201ccould not even keep his story straight on the stand.\u201d\n\nStone, a longtime Republican political operative, friend of Trump and self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster,\u201d was arrested on Jan. 25. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of making false statements to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering.\n\nBesides probing the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow ran an operation to hack Democratic Party computers and spread disinformation to undermine candidate Hillary Clinton and the American electoral process, Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow officials.\n\nTrump denies collusion and Russia denies allegations of meddling.\n\nStone apologized to the judge for the post on Instagram and asked for a second chance.\n\nRelated Coverage Judge orders ex-Trump aide Stone not to speak publicly about his criminal case\n\n\u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow,\u201d Jackson told Stone.\n\n\u201cWhat all of this means, Mr. Stone, is that any violation of this order will be a basis for revoking your bond and detaining you pending trial. So I want to be clear - today I gave you a second chance. But this is not baseball. There will not be a third chance.\u201d\n\nJackson had ordered Stone to appear in court to review whether the posting on his Instagram account violated his conditions of release and a narrowly tailored media gag order she imposed last week. He is out on a $250,000 bond and is free to travel without court permission to certain cities.\n\nThe media gag order did not explicitly bar Stone from speaking publicly about the case as long as he was not on courthouse grounds.\n\nHowever, it cautioned him to tread carefully and said he would not be able to complain later if he decided his own comments had tainted the jury pool.\n\nThe original posting on Monday on Stone\u2019s Instagram account not only contained a photo of Jackson next to the crosshairs, but also had text that ranted against Mueller as a \u201chitman\u201d and called Jackson \u201can Obama-appointed judge\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor in the White House.\n\nStone later took the image down and apologized, but afterwards he gave an interview on conspiracy website Infowars defending the post.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Stone said: \u201cI abused the order,\u201d Stone said. \u201cI am kicking myself over my own stupidity.\u201d\n\nRoger Stone, former political adviser of U.S. President Donald Trump, departs after a hearing where Stone said he had \"abused\" a gag order with an Instagram post that appeared to threaten U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over his criminal trial, at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2019.

I\u2019m hurtfully sorry.\u201d\n\nThe investigation has clouded Trump\u2019s two years in office and has been a frequent target of the president and his allies. So far, the investigation has ensnared 34 people.\n\nThe most tense exchanges of Thursday\u2019s hearing were during a cross-examination by prosecutor Jonathan Kravis, who repeatedly tried to get Stone to reveal who had selected the image for him.\n\nStone testified he has between five and six volunteers who come and go freely from his home and have access to his cell phone. He rattled off the names of some volunteers, but also said he could not remember all of them.\n\nAt first when asked by his lawyer Bruce Rogow if one of those volunteers had posted the image, Stone testified he did not select or review it.\n\nLater, however, Stone said he had seen the picture and posted it himself, but did not realize its implications.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, did you not just tell me under oath less than five minutes ago that someone else posted it?\u201d Jackson asked Stone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not inconsistent - I didn\u2019t choose the image. I did post it,\u201d Stone replied.\n\nLater, he again changed the story, saying he had at his disposal several images of the judge to choose from before the posting.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cI erased all of the images of your honor because I did not want to make the same mistake twice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou had a choice?\u201d an incredulous Jackson asked. \u201cYou closed your eyes and picked?\u201d"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-ford-emissions/ford-probing-possible-problems-with-fuel-economy-emissions-tests-idUSKCN1QA2U0", "text": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it has hired outside experts to investigate its vehicle fuel economy and testing procedures after employees raised concerns, and did not know whether it would have to correct data provided to regulators or consumers.\n\nThe logo of Ford is seen during the 88th International Motor Show at Palexpo in Geneva, Switzerland, March 6, 2018.

In 2013, the automaker cut by seven miles per gallon the claimed fuel economy for its C-Max hybrid model following complaints that real-world mileage did not match the claimed fuel economy.

The United Nations confirmed these figures as official government data provided at the end of January and said North Korea\u2019s food production included rice, wheat, potatoes and soy beans.\n\nNorth Korea said it would import 200,000 tons of food and produce about 400,000 tons of early crops, but that it would still be left with a gap and from January would cut daily rations to 300 grams (10.5 ounces) per person from 550 grams.\n\nU.N. officials and aid groups in North Korea were consulting the government to \u201cfurther understand the impact of the food security situation on the most vulnerable people in order to take early action to address their humanitarian needs,\u201d U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday.\n\nHe said the United Nations and aid groups were only able to help one third of six million people estimated to be in need last year due to a lack of funding. A U.N. appeal for $111 million in 2018 was only a quarter funded, Dujarric said.\n\nThe United Nations estimates a total of 10.3 million people - almost half the population - are in need and some 41 percent of North Koreans are undernourished, Dujarric said.\n\nBAD HARVEST\n\nAlong with extreme weather, the North Korean memo also blames U.N. sanctions for restricting the delivery of farming materials and hindering fuel supply for the agricultural sector.\n\nU.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun said earlier this month the United States had eased rules on humanitarian assistance to North Korea and was working to clear a backlog of U.N. approvals.\n\nBenjamin Silberstein, co-editor of North Korean Economy Watch and an associate scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said the harvest had been bad but there was no sign of an emergency.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s at least partially about the sanctions,\u201d Silberstein said.\n\n\u201cJust look at the way the letter is worded. They want to make it sound like sanctions equals starvation so the U.S. should really be benevolent and give them up,\u201d he said.\n\nHumanitarian aid nearly ground to a halt in 2018 as the United States stepped up enforcement of U.N. sanctions, even though the Security Council North Korea sanctions committee has said sanctions \u201care not intended to have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Security Council sanctions clearly exempt humanitarian activities, there have been unintended consequences on humanitarian operations,\u201d Dujarric said.\n\nMargareta Wahlstrom, president of the Swedish Red Cross, told Reuters after a trip to North Korea in November that, as far as the areas in which they operated were concerned, the maize harvest was only 65 percent of what should be normal due to the combination of an influenza outbreak, a heat wave and a typhoon.\n\nFILE PHOTO - A North Korean farm is seen in the rice paddy fields on Hwanggumpyong Island, located in the middle of the Yalu River, near the North Korean town of Sinuiju, opposite the Chinese border city of Dandong, North Phyongan Province, North Korea, June 19, 2015.

Since 2016, his administration has purchased 17 tonnes of the metal worth around $650 million from so-called artisan miners, according to the most recent data from the nation\u2019s central bank.\n\nPaid with the country\u2019s near-worthless bank notes, these amateurs in turn supply the government with hard currency to purchase badly needed imports of food and hygiene products. This gold trade is a blip on international markets. Still, the United States is using sanctions and intimidation in an effort to stop Maduro from using his nation\u2019s gold to stay afloat.\n\nThe Trump administration is pressuring the United Kingdom not to release $1.2 billion in gold reserves Venezuela has stored in the Bank of England. U.S. officials recently castigated an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm for its Venezuela gold purchases, and have warned other potential foreign buyers to back off.\n\nThe existence of Maduro\u2019s gold program is well-known. How it functions is not.\n\nTo get a glimpse inside, Reuters tracked Venezuela\u2019s gold from steamy jungle mines, through the central bank in the capital of Caracas to gold refineries and food exporters abroad, speaking with more than 30 people with knowledge of the trade. They included miners, intermediaries, merchants, academic researchers, diplomats and government officials. Almost all requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, or because they feared retribution from Venezuelan or U.S. authorities.\n\nWhat emerges is the portrait of a desperate experiment in laissez-faire industrial policy by Venezuela\u2019s socialist leaders. U.S. sanctions have hammered the nation\u2019s oil industry and crippled its ability to borrow. The formal mining sector has been decimated by nationalization. So Maduro has unleashed freelance prospectors to extract the nation\u2019s mineral wealth with virtually no regulation or state investment.\n\nThe Bolivarian Revolution now leans heavily on ragtag laborers such as Jose Aular, a teenager who says he has contracted malaria five times at a wildcat mine near Venezuela\u2019s border with Brazil. Aular works 12 hours daily lugging sacks of earth to a small mill that uses toxic mercury to extract flecks of precious metal. Mining accidents are common in these ramshackle operations, workers said. So are shootings and robberies.\n\n\u201cThe government knows what happens in these mines and it benefits from it,\u201d said Aular, 18. \u201cOur gold goes into their hands.\u201d\n\nMaduro has also received a crucial assist from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a fellow strongman who has likewise sparred with the Trump administration.\n\nVenezuela exports part of its gold to Turkey, then uses some of the proceeds to buy that nation\u2019s consumer goods, according to opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni. Turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in Maduro\u2019s subsidized food program. Trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year.\n\nBut scrutiny is intensifying as Venezuela\u2019s politics reach the boiling point. In recent days, many Western countries have recognized Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American nation\u2019s rightful president.\n\nMaduro\u2019s adversaries have called on foreign buyers of Venezuela\u2019s precious metal to stop doing business with what they say is an illegitimate regime.\n\n\u201cWe are going to protect our gold,\u201d opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni told Reuters in an interview.\n\nGOLD FEVER\n\nThe gold road begins in places like La Culebra, an isolated jungle area in southern Venezuela. Here, hundreds of men labor in crude mining operations that would be at home in the 19th century. They excavate mineral-laden dirt with picks in hand-dug tunnels, hauling it out with pulleys and winches.\n\nTheir activity is laying waste to fragile forest ecosystems and spreading mosquito-borne diseases. Miners complain of shakedowns by military forces sent to guard the region, whose homicide rate is seven times the national average. Venezuela\u2019s ministries of defense and information did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA man melts gold at his workshop in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela August 7, 2018. REUTERS/William Urdaneta\n\nMiner Jose Rondon is used to hardship. Now 47, he arrived in 2016 from northeast Venezuela with his two adult sons. His bus driver\u2019s salary could not keep pace with Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation, which the International Monetary Fund projects will hit 10 million percent this year.\n\nThe three men net roughly 10 grams of gold monthly from backbreaking work. Still it is roughly 20 times what they could earn back home.\n\n\u201cHere I do much better,\u201d said Rondon, resting in a crude bunkhouse strung with hammocks.\n\nGold in hand, miners head to the town of El Callao to sell their nuggets. Most buyers are unlicensed, small-scale traders working in cramped shops fitted with alarms and steel doors.\n\n\u201cThe state is buying gold, everyone is buying gold, because it\u2019s what is doing well,\u201d said Jhony Diaz, a licensed wholesaler in Puerto Ordaz, 171 kilometers (106 miles) north of El Callao. Diaz says he buys gold from traders and resells every three days to the central bank.\n\nBecause Venezuela\u2019s currency, the bolivar, is worth less every hour someone holds it, the state pays a premium over international prices to make it worthwhile for those who could smuggle gold out of the country to exchange for dollars.\n\nTraders who sell to Diaz end up with bricks of cash to carry back to El Callao and other gold-rush towns to pay miners, who use it to buy food, supplies and send whatever is left to their families.\n\nGold purchased by the government is smelted in the nearby furnaces of Minerven, the state-run mining company, according to a high-ranking employee. It is then transported to the vaults of the central bank in the capital Caracas, 843 kilometers (524 miles) away.\n\nThe gold does not stay there long. The central bank\u2019s gold reserves have plummeted to their lowest levels in 75 years as it sells the gold to pay its bills. One of the main buyers of this gold is Turkey, Paparoni said.\n\nTURKISH ALLIANCE\n\nMaduro\u2019s gold program has developed in tandem with his deepening relationship with Turkey\u2019s Erdogan. Both leaders have been criticized internationally for cracking down on political dissent and undermining democratic norms to concentrate power.\n\nA Nov. 1 executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump bars U.S. persons and entities from buying gold from Venezuela. It does not apply to foreigners. Ankara has assured the U.S. Treasury that all of Turkey\u2019s trade with Venezuela is in accordance with international law.\n\nVenezuela in December 2016 announced a direct flight from Caracas to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. The development was surprising given low demand for travel between the two nations.\n\nTrade data show those planes are carrying more than passengers. On New Year\u2019s Day, 2018, Venezuela\u2019s central bank began shipping gold to Turkey with a $36 million air shipment of the metal to Istanbul. It came just weeks after a visit by Maduro to Turkey.\n\nShipments last year reached $900 million, according to Turkish government data and trade reports.\n\nSocialist Party leader Tareck El Aissami during a visit to Turkey in January said Venezuela was boosting gold sales to Turkey while seeking to increase the supply of Turkish food products to Venezuela, state-owned Turkish Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nTurkish consumer products, meanwhile, are making their way to Venezuelan tables. In early December, 54 containers of Turkish powdered milk arrived at the port of La Guaira near Caracas, according to port records seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Istanbul-based shipper, Mulberry Proje Yatirim, shares an address with Marilyns Proje Yatirim, a mining company that signed a joint venture with Venezuela\u2019s state mining firm Minerven last year, according to filings with a Turkish trade registry gazette in September.\n\nThe companies did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven Maduro\u2019s critics acknowledge he has pulled off a neat trick of alchemy: By compensating hard-pressed citizen miners with inflation-ravaged bolivars and obtaining precious metal in return, he has found a way to spin straw into gold.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nVenezuelan economist Angel Alvarado, an opposition lawmaker, said \u201cdark operations and unusual mechanisms of commercial exchange,\u201d are among the few tools Maduro has left.\n\n\u201cThere is a desperation to stay in power at all costs,\u201d Alvarado said."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-moon-israel/israel-set-to-join-elite-lunar-club-with-first-mission-to-moon-idUSKCN1QA2V9?il=0", "text": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

The Boeing and SpaceX systems have already been delayed several times in recent years, which is common in this sector given the complexity of building multibillion-dollar spacecraft capable of shedding earth\u2019s gravity.\n\nNASA spokesman Joshua Finch deferred all technical questions on Boeing and SpaceX systems to the companies, citing confidentiality, but said: \u201cFlying safely always takes precedence over schedule.\u201d\n\nBoeing spokesman Josh Barrett said the company \u201cclosed out\u201d the capsule\u2019s structural vulnerability risk when it completed its structural test program in January. While Boeing is working through a number of other issues, they \u201care not driving any major architectural system changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur numbers show we are exceeding NASA\u2019s safety requirements,\u201d said Barrett.\n\nSpaceX spokesman James Gleeson said the company, working with NASA, has developed \u201cone of the safest, most-advanced human spaceflight systems ever built.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more important to SpaceX than safely flying crew,\u201d said Gleeson, calling it \u201ccore to our company\u2019s long-term goal of enabling access for people who dream of flying to space.\u201d\n\nFounded by Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, SpaceX has cut the cost of rocket launches with its pioneering reusable rocket technology, while Boeing traces its space business back to the first U.S. human space missions of the 1960s and is also the world\u2019s largest planemaker.\n\nThe clock is ticking. The U.S. has been paying Russia about $80 million per ticket for a ride to the International Space Station, a $100 billion orbital research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (402 km) above Earth.\n\nOne of Boeing Co's CST-100 Starliner astronaut capsules is seen at a production facility in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., January 15, 2019. REUTERS/Eric M. Johnson\n\nThere are no seats available for U.S. crew on the Russia spacecraft after 2019 given production schedules and other factors. NASA said last week it was considering paying for two more seats to the space station for this fall and spring 2020 to ensure U.S. access.\n\nThe NASA plan for extra seats came a week after its safety panel said Congress should come up with a \u201cmitigation plan\u201d in case delays threaten U.S. access to the space station - echoing earlier concerns from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nNASA is set to conduct a flight readiness review on Friday for SpaceX\u2019s mission without a crew on March 2. NASA will decide whether to approve the test flight without a crew, while SpaceX addresses the issues raised for a human mission.\n\nPARACHUTE WEAKNESSES\n\nThree people familiar with the project say the U.S. space agency has identified some design discrepancies between earlier SpaceX capsules designed to haul cargo to the International Space Station, and a newer version designed to carry humans.\n\nSome of the risks - such as those identified in the designs of the enormous parachutes that deploy when the capsule plummets back to Earth at supersonic speeds - are uncommon given how close SpaceX is to test flights, two of the people said.\n\nThe timing of deployment of the SpaceX parachutes and the interaction of the parachutes themselves have raised concerns about parachute performance, and potentially whether they will be able to slow down the capsule enough to ensure the crew\u2019s safety, two people said.\n\nSpaceX has completed 17 parachute tests for the Commercial Crew Program so far, with an additional 10 tests planned prior to Crew Dragon\u2019s second demonstration mission, Gleeson said. He also said its parachute systems are designed with redundancy so the vehicle can still safely splashdown in the event that one parachute fails.\n\nNASA\u2019s safety panel said in its report that SpaceX may be required to re-design its parachute system. A re-design would likely trigger more testing and potentially weeks or months of extra delays, two of the people said.\n\nNASA also found design problems with the system that helps orient SpaceX\u2019s capsule in an upright position once it lands in the ocean, raising the risk of taking on excessive amounts of water, according to two industry sources and confirmed by a NASA official.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Gleeson said Crew Dragon\u2019s outer shell is water-resistant, and the spacecraft itself is buoyant and does not pose a risk to crew members after splashdown.\n\nRISK OF MORE DELAYS\n\nNASA announced earlier this month that SpaceX was now targeting March 2 instead of Feb. 23 for its un-crewed Crew Dragon test flight, with its astronaut flight planned for July. NASA explained the delay by citing vague concerns for both contractors, such as the need to complete hardware testing and other work.\n\nNASA said Boeing\u2019s un-crewed Starliner would fly \u201cno earlier\u201d than April, with the crewed mission currently slated for August. This is the schedule now at risk, according to the NASA report.\n\nThe challenges in front of Boeing include last year\u2019s failure during a test of its launch-abort engines, which spilled caustic fuel on the test stand, Boeing\u2019s Barrett said. The accident was caused by faulty valves which Boeing has re-designed and re-ordered from the supplier, though the new valves must be re-tested, Barrett said.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe test flights are also part of collecting the data needed to close out some risk items, NASA said.\n\n\u201cSpaceX and Boeing both have challenges, both comparable, from a safety perspective,\u201d said one U.S. government source."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-stone/judge-tightens-gag-order-on-ex-trump-adviser-stone-warning-he-could-be-jailed-idUSKCN1QA2OZ?il=0", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A visibly angry judge on Thursday ordered President Donald Trump\u2019s former political adviser Roger Stone to stop speaking publicly about U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s criminal case against him or else he will be sent to jail pending trial.\n\nIn a tense court hearing on Thursday, U.S. Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said that Stone\u2019s apology and explanations for why he posted a photo of her next to the image of the crosshairs of a gun on his Instagram account were not credible.\n\nJackson made her ruling after a highly unusual hearing in which Stone, who is charged with crimes related to Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, took the stand to testify about the posting.\n\nStone\u2019s seemingly contradictory statements and at times foggy recollections about the post\u2019s origins during a cross-examination by the government frustrated Jackson, who later concluded he \u201ccould not even keep his story straight on the stand.\u201d\n\nStone, a longtime Republican political operative, friend of Trump and self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster,\u201d was arrested on Jan. 25. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of making false statements to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering.\n\nBesides probing the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow ran an operation to hack Democratic Party computers and spread disinformation to undermine candidate Hillary Clinton and the American electoral process, Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow officials.\n\nTrump denies collusion and Russia denies allegations of meddling.\n\nStone apologized to the judge for the post on Instagram and asked for a second chance.\n\nRelated Coverage Judge orders ex-Trump aide Stone not to speak publicly about his criminal case\n\n\u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow,\u201d Jackson told Stone.\n\n\u201cWhat all of this means, Mr. Stone, is that any violation of this order will be a basis for revoking your bond and detaining you pending trial. So I want to be clear - today I gave you a second chance. But this is not baseball. There will not be a third chance.\u201d\n\nJackson had ordered Stone to appear in court to review whether the posting on his Instagram account violated his conditions of release and a narrowly tailored media gag order she imposed last week. He is out on a $250,000 bond and is free to travel without court permission to certain cities.\n\nThe media gag order did not explicitly bar Stone from speaking publicly about the case as long as he was not on courthouse grounds.\n\nHowever, it cautioned him to tread carefully and said he would not be able to complain later if he decided his own comments had tainted the jury pool.\n\nThe original posting on Monday on Stone\u2019s Instagram account not only contained a photo of Jackson next to the crosshairs, but also had text that ranted against Mueller as a \u201chitman\u201d and called Jackson \u201can Obama-appointed judge\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor in the White House.\n\nStone later took the image down and apologized, but afterwards he gave an interview on conspiracy website Infowars defending the post.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Stone said: \u201cI abused the order,\u201d Stone said. \u201cI am kicking myself over my own stupidity.\u201d\n\nRoger Stone, former political adviser of U.S. President Donald Trump, departs after a hearing where Stone said he had \"abused\" a gag order with an Instagram post that appeared to threaten U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over his criminal trial, at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2019.

I\u2019m hurtfully sorry.\u201d\n\nThe investigation has clouded Trump\u2019s two years in office and has been a frequent target of the president and his allies. So far, the investigation has ensnared 34 people.\n\nThe most tense exchanges of Thursday\u2019s hearing were during a cross-examination by prosecutor Jonathan Kravis, who repeatedly tried to get Stone to reveal who had selected the image for him.\n\nStone testified he has between five and six volunteers who come and go freely from his home and have access to his cell phone. He rattled off the names of some volunteers, but also said he could not remember all of them.\n\nAt first when asked by his lawyer Bruce Rogow if one of those volunteers had posted the image, Stone testified he did not select or review it.\n\nLater, however, Stone said he had seen the picture and posted it himself, but did not realize its implications.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, did you not just tell me under oath less than five minutes ago that someone else posted it?\u201d Jackson asked Stone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not inconsistent - I didn\u2019t choose the image. I did post it,\u201d Stone replied.\n\nLater, he again changed the story, saying he had at his disposal several images of the judge to choose from before the posting.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cI erased all of the images of your honor because I did not want to make the same mistake twice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou had a choice?\u201d an incredulous Jackson asked. \u201cYou closed your eyes and picked?\u201d"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-ford-emissions/ford-probing-possible-problems-with-fuel-economy-emissions-tests-idUSKCN1QA2U0?il=0", "text": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it has hired outside experts to investigate its vehicle fuel economy and testing procedures after employees raised concerns, and did not know whether it would have to correct data provided to regulators or consumers.\n\nThe logo of Ford is seen during the 88th International Motor Show at Palexpo in Geneva, Switzerland, March 6, 2018.

Russia is now cutting its losses and selling the three ships to India without engines.\n\nThe navy\u2019s problems stem largely, but not exclusively, from the Ukrainian sanctions. There are also problems, for different reasons, with new equipment for the army and air force.\n\nThe picture that emerges is that Russia\u2019s armed forces are not as capable or modern as its annual Red Square military parades suggest and that its ability to project conventional force is more limited too.\n\n\u201cYou need to always distinguish between reality and the shop window,\u201d said Andrei Frolov, editor-in-chief of Russian magazine Arms Exports.\n\n\u201cRed Square is a shop window.

But Russian officials and military experts say Moscow has a shortage of modern factories and skilled labor and does not have the available financial resources needed to reverse decades of post-Soviet decline as quickly as it wants.\n\nFrolov said Russia had successfully produced prototypes of new weapons systems, but struggled to move to serial production.\n\nThat does not mean Russia\u2019s military is not a force with which to be reckoned. Some of its hardware, such as its S-400 air defense systems, is world-class. Putin has also spent heavily on missile technology, unveiling new hypersonic systems.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s air force and army, like its navy, are experiencing re-armament problems. Its new stealth fighter first took to the air more than nine years ago and a super tank made its Red Square debut almost four years ago.

Viktor Polyakov, Saturn\u2019s current director, said early last year that prototypes of its three new engine types had passed tests and that serial production had begun.\n\nChemezov told Reuters at a military exhibition in Abu Dhabi this month that an undisclosed number of engines had been handed to the navy. But none has yet been fitted to the frigates.\n\nSaturn says it has received initial orders from the Ministry of Defense. But one source close to the matter said the ministry had not yet guaranteed how many engines it would buy.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t expect Russia to start fully fledged serial production for at least another five years,\u201d said Serhiy Zgurets, director of Defense Express, a Ukrainian consultancy.\n\nAlexei Rakhmanov, head of Russia\u2019s United Shipbuilding Corporation, said in December that the first Russian-made engine should be fitted to the fourth of 14 more planned frigates in the \u201cvery nearest future.\u201d\n\nEven if that happens, Igor Ponomarev, the head of the St Petersburg shipyard making the new stealth frigates, says that vessel is not due to be ready before the end of 2022. The rest of the program is likely to stretch into the 2030s.\n\nTROUBLED STEALTH FIGHTER AND TANK\n\nRussia\u2019s planned new Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter jet is also experiencing problems.\n\nMoscow had initially been expected to procure about 150 of the fifth-generation Su-57s, but defense industry and government officials say they now expect just one plane, the first serially-produced aircraft, this year.

That\u2019s a question that investors are pondering as Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s ties with Russia, and other stuff, finishes up.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 20, 2018\n\nDemocrats, who now control the House of Representatives, appear eager to use Mueller\u2019s findings to commence a process of defenestration. Fund managers, including so-called \u201cmacro investors\u201d who make large bets on currencies and interest rates, have a few ideas to trade what might happen next \u2013 the most intriguing of which runs through the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThere\u2019s little consensus on how measures to oust the president by constitutional means would affect financial markets. Putting aside their own political biases or personal views on Trump\u2019s stewardship, investors don\u2019t have a clear answer from history for how to position their portfolios. The two historical antecedents of the past half-century offer conflicting messages.\n\nThe last American commander-in-chief to experience impeachment by Congress was Bill Clinton, just over 20 years ago, for lying to a grand jury and obstruction of justice. The charges failed to achieve a super-majority in the Senate, needed to remove a president. In the 12 months leading up to December 19, 1998 \u2013 when the House cast its vote \u2013 the S&P 500 Index had risen 27 percent. In the following year, the index rose another 19 percent.\n\nThe case against Richard Nixon in 1974 suggests a rather different outcome. From the start of the acute phase of the Watergate scandal to Nixon\u2019s departure from the Oval Office in August that year, the average had tumbled 40 percent. In just the year leading up to his August 9 resignation, the S&P fell 23 percent. It rose just 7 percent over the next 12 months.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything to glean from the two situations, it\u2019s that broader economic conditions have more influence than politics on equity returns. In Nixon\u2019s case, some of his other policy decisions, such as withdrawal from the Bretton Woods Accord, ending the convertibility of the dollar; and geopolitics, including the Yom Kippur War and corresponding OPEC oil embargo for America\u2019s support of Israel, mattered more than impeachment or resignation.\n\nSimilarly, the booming economy of the Clinton years encouraged investors to ignore the political investigation into the Democratic president\u2019s personal infidelities. American GDP grew by more than 4 percent annually in the last two years of the 20th Century, thanks to the first internet-fueled investment boom, leading to a rare federal government fiscal surplus.\n\nInvestors still need to consider hedging their bets. The chances of an impeachment by the House are greater than zero. Betting markets, like those monitored by PredictIt, forecast a near-30 percent chance of it happening before 2020. That\u2019s in line with informal polls conducted by Breakingviews at Predictions events last month. Some 80 percent of attendees voting in New York in January gave impeachment a 30 percent or higher probability.\n\nThe bottom line comes down to whether the economy and corporate earnings would continue to grow. If two-thirds of the Senate approved removing Trump, economic policy would pass to an administration led by Vice President Mike Pence. He\u2019d likely pursue a traditional Republican agenda of lower taxes and minimised regulation \u2013 not much different from the Trump administration. All things being equal, that might help stocks.\n\nOn the other hand, the looming effects of Trump\u2019s loose fiscal policy could lead to higher interest rates, which might dampen growth and corporate earnings. Hence there\u2019s no clear direction one way or the other to posit from a Trump impeachment. Or as one investor explains cynically: \u201call the smart people who have been busy saving in the world are all going to have a different view on the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nWhich leads to Saudi Arabia. If there\u2019s one stark difference of opinion between the president and legislature, it\u2019s in their approach to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In December, a vote to end military aid for the kingdom\u2019s war in Yemen, and to blame MbS for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, received 56 votes in the Republican-led Senate, an unusual rebuke to the White House. Last week, the House voted 248-177 in favor of a similar motion.\n\nTrump will oppose any bill that crosses his desk. And neither chamber mustered sufficient support to override a presidential veto. But it illustrates how crucial \u2013 even existential \u2013 the president\u2019s support is for MbS. A weakened or impeached Trump would remove the last protection Saudi currently enjoys from the wrath of Congress. That could allow legislation such as the current bill, and additional sanctions, to become law.\n\nHow Riyadh would respond is hard to say. In the past it has weaponised the price of oil, primarily by cutting production. Even if that didn\u2019t happen, opponents of MbS could be emboldened to try to depose him, potentially disrupting oil production. Though the United States is a major energy producer, the higher oil prices that would arise from either outcome would hurt consumers, dent profits, slow the economy and hurt the stock market.\n\nHence the play. One-year options to buy West Texas Intermediate Crude at $100 a barrel currently cost about a quarter of one percent. At an average price this year of around $52 per barrel, they\u2019re way out of the money. A return to three-digit oil following a Saudi supply shock, then, would deliver a massive return. True, chaos in the kingdom would have lots of other knock-on effects, as would an abrupt end of the Trump presidency. But even in bedlam there\u2019s money to be made."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-oil-refinery/wild-cats-boas-are-obstacles-in-mexican-presidents-refinery-race-idUSKCN1QA1JA", "text": "PARAISO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s race to build an oil refinery in record time on land that was until recently alive with mangrove, wild cats and boa constrictors, has run into trouble, complicating his effort to revive ailing state-oil company Pemex.\n\nEven before Lopez Obrador took office last December, work had begun to cut down protected woodland on Pemex land on the coast of Tabasco state to make room for the new refinery next to the Dos Bocas port.\n\nBut oil industry environmental regulator ASEA in January ruled that the contractor that deforested the land did not have the correct permits to do so. The body levied a fine of about $700,000. ASEA says work on the refinery can only go ahead once a full environmental impact assessment is done and approved.\n\nThat could delay the refinery project for months or even years, just as the government is trying to boost oil output by giving the state a bigger role in the industry, modernizing refineries and building the new one in Tabasco, Lopez Obrador\u2019s home state.\n\nGustavo Alanis, president of the Mexican Center of Environmental Law advocacy group, said Pemex will run into legal problems if it continues to act in haste over the planned Dos Bocas refinery.\n\n\u201cIf they move quickly without paying heed to the laws they need to follow, they\u2019ll become their own worst enemy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government has said it plans to tender for the construction of the $8 billion refinery in March and finish building it in three years.

The U.S. trade deficit with China reached a record $382 billion through the first 11 months of 2018.\n\nThe two sides have reached consensus on how to alleviate the trade imbalances, several Chinese government sources said. Washington and Beijing are looking at a 10-item list for that, including additional Chinese purchases of agricultural produce, energy and goods such as semiconductors.\n\nU.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue called China\u2019s pledges to purchase U.S. agricultural produce premature.\n\n\u201cThose proposals are all contingent upon a grand deal,\u201d he said on the sidelines of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s annual forum in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe real issue is structural reforms regarding intellectual property, enforceability of those types of provisions.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe United States could quickly recover its lost agricultural markets in China if a deal is struck, he said.\n\nPerdue has overseen $12 billion in federal aid to U.S. farmers for losses they have sustained because of the trade war.

Just like the farm bankruptcies, (the) farmland price story is similar: Some states have seen an increase, some see a decrease,\u201d Johansson said.\n\nWhile the federal government does not track large-scale farm bankruptcies, USDA does track a special category of bankruptcies for smaller to mid-sized farms - Chapter 12 filings.\n\nAccording to federal data, Chapter 12 filings have hit the highest level in a decade in parts of the U.S. Midwest and Great Plains states, where commodity grains, oilseeds and livestock producers have been adversely affected by trade conflicts.\n\nStill, the USDA said the number of these filings remained well below levels seen during the farm crisis of the 1980s, when thousands of farm operations financially collapsed after producers fell behind on high-interest land and equipment loans. This time, farmers\u2019 debt-to-asset ratios have largely held up thanks to land prices withstanding the fall.\n\nFarm incomes and agrarian credit conditions continued to erode in the second half of 2018 and for bankers, one key concern has been the amount of farmland that could come up for sale in the coming months and whether that could trigger an across-the-board fall for land prices.\n\nAlthough farmland values remained stable - or improved slightly in some areas - increasing stress in the farm sector could put downward pressure on farm real estate values moving forward, according to bankers.\n\n\u201cWhat if land values fall?

If they do that, we hone out exact words in the second week of March and it goes to the summit for approval.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, the summit of all EU national leaders that is due on March 21-22 in Brussels, would have to agree a Brexit delay for Britain beyond March 29, sources in the bloc said, to delay the worst-case scenario of an abrupt split without a deal.\n\nMay will have a further chance to lobby EU leaders at the weekend in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh during an EU-Arab League summit focused on migration, trade and security.\n\nBritish lawmakers voted 432-202 against her deal on Jan. 15, the worst defeat in modern British parliamentary history.\n\nWith the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for Brexit, Britain is ensnared in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project that it joined in 1973.\n\nJuncker said failure to agree an orderly divorce would be economically devastating.\n\n\u201cIf no deal were to happen, and I cannot exclude this, this would have terrible economic and social consequences in Britain and on the continent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am not very optimistic when it comes to this issue.\u201d"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dropbox-results/dropbox-expects-drop-in-first-quarter-operating-margin-shares-fall-idUSKCN1QA2RV", "text": "(Reuters) - File sharing and storage company Dropbox Inc forecast a drop in current-quarter operating margins from a year earlier, sending its shares down nearly 11 percent in extended trading.\n\nThe Dropbox app logo seen on a mobile phone in this illustration photo October 16, 2017.

For SpaceX, the report mentioned the redesign of a SpaceX rocket canister following a 2016 explosion and its \u201cload and go\u201d process of fueling the rocket with the crew already inside the capsule. \u201cParachute performance\u201d remained an issue for both companies.\n\n\u201cThere are serious challenges to the current launch schedules for both SpaceX and Boeing,\u201d the report said.\n\nFor an interactive version of this story, click tmsnrt.rs/2V6pXyN\n\nTwo people with direct knowledge of the program told Reuters that the space agency\u2019s concerns go beyond the four items listed, and include a risk ledger that as of early February contained 30 to 35 lingering technical concerns each for SpaceX and Boeing. Reuters could not verify what all of the nearly three dozen items are. But the sources familiar with the matter said the companies must address \u201cmost\u201d of those concerns before flying astronauts and, eventually, tourists to space.\n\nThe NASA risk database is updated routinely during the course of NASA\u2019s stringent certification process, which includes data collection, tests and collaboration with SpaceX and Boeing, the people said. The Boeing and SpaceX systems have already been delayed several times in recent years, which is common in this sector given the complexity of building multibillion-dollar spacecraft capable of shedding earth\u2019s gravity.\n\nNASA spokesman Joshua Finch deferred all technical questions on Boeing and SpaceX systems to the companies, citing confidentiality, but said: \u201cFlying safely always takes precedence over schedule.\u201d\n\nBoeing spokesman Josh Barrett said the company \u201cclosed out\u201d the capsule\u2019s structural vulnerability risk when it completed its structural test program in January. While Boeing is working through a number of other issues, they \u201care not driving any major architectural system changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur numbers show we are exceeding NASA\u2019s safety requirements,\u201d said Barrett.\n\nSpaceX spokesman James Gleeson said the company, working with NASA, has developed \u201cone of the safest, most-advanced human spaceflight systems ever built.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more important to SpaceX than safely flying crew,\u201d said Gleeson, calling it \u201ccore to our company\u2019s long-term goal of enabling access for people who dream of flying to space.\u201d\n\nFounded by Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, SpaceX has cut the cost of rocket launches with its pioneering reusable rocket technology, while Boeing traces its space business back to the first U.S. human space missions of the 1960s and is also the world\u2019s largest planemaker.\n\nThe clock is ticking.

NASA said last week it was considering paying for two more seats to the space station for this fall and spring 2020 to ensure U.S. access.\n\nThe NASA plan for extra seats came a week after its safety panel said Congress should come up with a \u201cmitigation plan\u201d in case delays threaten U.S. access to the space station - echoing earlier concerns from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nNASA is set to conduct a flight readiness review on Friday for SpaceX\u2019s mission without a crew on March 2. NASA will decide whether to approve the test flight without a crew, while SpaceX addresses the issues raised for a human mission.\n\nPARACHUTE WEAKNESSES\n\nThree people familiar with the project say the U.S. space agency has identified some design discrepancies between earlier SpaceX capsules designed to haul cargo to the International Space Station, and a newer version designed to carry humans.\n\nSome of the risks - such as those identified in the designs of the enormous parachutes that deploy when the capsule plummets back to Earth at supersonic speeds - are uncommon given how close SpaceX is to test flights, two of the people said.\n\nThe timing of deployment of the SpaceX parachutes and the interaction of the parachutes themselves have raised concerns about parachute performance, and potentially whether they will be able to slow down the capsule enough to ensure the crew\u2019s safety, two people said.\n\nSpaceX has completed 17 parachute tests for the Commercial Crew Program so far, with an additional 10 tests planned prior to Crew Dragon\u2019s second demonstration mission, Gleeson said. He also said its parachute systems are designed with redundancy so the vehicle can still safely splashdown in the event that one parachute fails.\n\nNASA\u2019s safety panel said in its report that SpaceX may be required to re-design its parachute system. A re-design would likely trigger more testing and potentially weeks or months of extra delays, two of the people said.\n\nNASA also found design problems with the system that helps orient SpaceX\u2019s capsule in an upright position once it lands in the ocean, raising the risk of taking on excessive amounts of water, according to two industry sources and confirmed by a NASA official.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Gleeson said Crew Dragon\u2019s outer shell is water-resistant, and the spacecraft itself is buoyant and does not pose a risk to crew members after splashdown.\n\nRISK OF MORE DELAYS\n\nNASA announced earlier this month that SpaceX was now targeting March 2 instead of Feb. 23 for its un-crewed Crew Dragon test flight, with its astronaut flight planned for July. NASA explained the delay by citing vague concerns for both contractors, such as the need to complete hardware testing and other work.\n\nNASA said Boeing\u2019s un-crewed Starliner would fly \u201cno earlier\u201d than April, with the crewed mission currently slated for August. This is the schedule now at risk, according to the NASA report.\n\nThe challenges in front of Boeing include last year\u2019s failure during a test of its launch-abort engines, which spilled caustic fuel on the test stand, Boeing\u2019s Barrett said. The accident was caused by faulty valves which Boeing has re-designed and re-ordered from the supplier, though the new valves must be re-tested, Barrett said.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe test flights are also part of collecting the data needed to close out some risk items, NASA said.\n\n\u201cSpaceX and Boeing both have challenges, both comparable, from a safety perspective,\u201d said one U.S. government source."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fbi-mccabe/ex-fbi-deputy-rosenstein-cited-two-people-who-might-have-pursued-trump-ouster-idUSKCN1QA2F2", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said on Thursday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told him he knew of two Cabinet members who might support invoking the 25th Amendment to oust President Donald Trump but he did not believe Rosenstein was actively seeking support for such a bold move.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J.

The CMA will then publish its final report by April 30.\n\nCompetition lawyers said there are few precedents for the CMA to dramatically revise its findings between provisional and final reports.\n\nSainsbury and Asda\u2019s key argument has been that Britain\u2019s grocery market is changing rapidly, driven by the growth of online and a broader range of competitors, most notably discounters Aldi and Lidl.\n\nHowever, the CMA effectively said that while new entrants are a force, it is the big four grocers - market leader Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons - who are most in competition with each other, making the Sainsbury-Asda deal a \u201cfour to three\u201d merger.\n\nLawyers said Sainsbury and Asda would have to come up with new evidence to change the CMA\u2019s thinking.\n\nWRONG FIGURES\n\n\u201cSainsbury\u2019s-Asda would need to pull something out of the bag, or they\u2019d need to show that the CMA has completely got its figures wrong,\u201d said Alex Haffner, partner and head of competition at law firm Fladgate LLP.\n\n\u201cAll they can realistically hope to achieve between now and the CMA\u2019s reporting deadline is to eat away at the size of the divestments required. They are undoubtedly facing an uphill challenge to make it work,\u201d Haffner said.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays said prior to Wednesday\u2019s ruling they had assumed a 67 percent chance of the deal proceeding. They now see a minimal chance of success.\n\nThey highlighted the CMA\u2019s view that any \u201cremedy stores\u201d would have to be sold to a single buyer, would have to be solely Sainsbury\u2019s or solely Asda\u2019s, not a mix, and be accompanied by the sale of either the Sainsbury or Asda brand name.\n\n\u201cAny one of these constraints would be painful - together they leave us skeptical that any viable package could be found,\u201d they said, arguing Amazon was the only company they could imagine being interested in buying so many stores.\n\nBut they cautioned that facilitating Amazon\u2019s scaling up in UK grocery might cost Sainsbury more in the long term. Amazon declined to comment.\n\nIf the CMA\u2019s final report differs little from its provisional findings, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda\u2019s last chance would be to challenge the ruling through the Competition Appeal Tribunal, a specialist judicial body.\n\nSainsbury Chief Executive Mike Coupe has said the company would take that route if it believed any ruling was not backed up by published evidence.\n\nCoupe, as the architect of the deal, could come under investor pressure if it fails. However, analysts speculated Sainsbury would be reluctant to jettison him given Chairman David Tyler is due to step down in March, or soon after, to be succeeded by Martin Scicluna.\n\nMeanwhile failure of the deal would block one potential exit route from Britain for Walmart. Analysts have said the U.S. group might instead consider a stock market listing of Asda or try to sell it to private equity.\n\n($1 = 0.7652 pounds)"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-embraer-m-a-boeing/brazil-court-dismisses-lawsuit-against-proposed-embraer-boeing-deal-idUSKCN1QA1MG", "text": "FILE PHOTO: The logo of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA is seen at the company's headquarters in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil February 28, 2018.

Stanford University. The Hoover Tower rises above Stanford University in Palo Alto, California REUTERS/Noah Berger\n\nContributing to its solid foothold at No. 1 is Stanford\u2019s steady stream of patents and research, which are frequently cited by other academics around the world. Those citations play a key role in the ranking of the world\u2019s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.\n\nRecent Stanford research highlights include several developments in the field of artificial intelligence, including the next generation of camera systems to guide self-driving cars and simulators that can predict potential drug interactions before new pharmaceuticals are ever tested on humans.\n\nWhile a few UK and Asian schools have ascended, American universities continue to dominate the top of Reuters\u2019 ranking. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, places second on the list, and Harvard University comes in third, making 2018 the fourth consecutive year that those universities have held those exact spots. The University of Pennsylvania came in fourth place for the second consecutive year, and the University of Washington is up two spots to round out the top five. The University of Texas System placed sixth. Belgium\u2019s KU Leuven, ranked No. 7, is the highest ranked university outside the U.S., followed by Imperial College London (No. 8), the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (No. 9) and Vanderbilt University (No. 10). Overall, eight of last year\u2019s 10 highest-ranked universities remained in the top 10.\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology\n\nOther universities on Reuters\u2019 ranking have broken out of the pack because of new, groundbreaking research. The biggest mover on this year\u2019s list is the University of Manchester, which surged 27 places from No. 80 to No. 53, largely because of research into the supermaterial graphene. Graphene is one of the strongest materials on Earth, yet also extremely light, flexible and highly conductive; it could prove a hugely important ingredient for future innovations in electronics, energy, transportation and other industries. Physicists theorized the existence of graphene in the 1940s, but it was first produced in 2004 by two University of Manchester scientists. Ever since then the university has dominated the world\u2019s research into the cutting-edge material. Manchester is home to the UK\u2019s National Graphene Institute, and patents related to graphene account for about a quarter of all filings from the university over the five-year period examined for this list.\n\nGeopolitical trends are also a factor in this year\u2019s rankings. In Europe, uncertainty over the United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d from the European Union may already be pushing research out of the country: Germany added two universities to the Global Top 100 in 2018, and Reuters\u2019 regional ranking of Europe\u2019s Most Innovative Universities showed German universities gaining more than any other country. In Asia, Chinese universities are increasing their presence among the top 100 thanks to a new government push for innovation, and a focus on filing more patent applications.\n\nOverall, the United States continues to dominate the list, with 46 universities in the top 100; Germany and Japan are tied for second best performing country, with nine universities each. South Korea has eight universities on the list; China, France and the United Kingdom each have 5; Switzerland has 3; Belgium, Canada, Israel and the Netherlands have 2, and Denmark and Singapore each have 1. Considered on a regional basis, North America has 48 universities in the top 100, Europe has 27, Asia has 23, and the Middle East has 2. There are no universities in the top 100 located in Africa, South America or Oceania.\n\nCareful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters\u2019 regional innovation lists, Asia\u2019s Most Innovative Universities and Europe\u2019s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global list. An institution\u2019s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.\n\nOf course, the relative ranking of any university \u2013 or whether it appears on the list at all \u2013 does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world\u2019s best medical schools, for instance. And it\u2019s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it\u2019s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.\n\nClick here for the full methodology."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-canada/huawei-committed-to-canadian-investment-despite-cfo-arrest-chairman-idUSKCN1QA29H", "text": "TORONTO (Reuters) - Huawei Chairman Liang Hua said on Thursday the company is committed to increasing investment in Canada despite the arrest of its chief financial officer by Canadian police at the request of the United States last December.\n\nA woman walks past a Huawei shop in Beijing, China, January 29, 2019.

The U.S. firm commands 25.8 percent of the global tablet market, nearly double Samsung\u2019s 13.3 percent.\n\nOnline, social media users were divided over the price, the features, and whether consumers would even need such a phone.\n\n\u201cInnovative?

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nQualcomm is seeking the ban in hopes of dealing Apple a blow before the two begin a major trial in mid-April in San Diego over Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has sought to apply pressure to Apple with smaller legal challenges ahead of that trial and has won partial iPhone sales bans in China and Germany against Apple, forcing the iPhone maker to ship only phones with Qualcomm chips to some markets.\n\nAny possible ban on iPhone imports to the United States could be short-lived because Apple last week for the first time disclosed that it has found a software fix to avoid infringing on one of Qualcomm\u2019s patents. Apple asked regulators to give it as much as six months to prove that the fix works.\n\nQualcomm brought a case against Apple at the U.S International Trade Commission in 2017 alleging that some iPhones violated Qualcomm patents to help smart phones run well without draining their batteries. Qualcomm asked for an import ban on some older iPhone models containing Intel Corp chips.\n\nIn September, Thomas Pender, an administrative law judge at the ITC, found that Apple violated one of the patents in the case but declined to issue a ban. Pender reasoned that imposing a ban on Intel-chipped iPhones would hand Qualcomm an effective monopoly on the U.S. market for modem chips, which connect smart phones to wireless data networks.\n\nPender\u2019s ruling said that preserving competition in the modem chip market was in the public interest as speedier 5G networks come online in the next few years.\n\nCases where the ITC finds patent violations but does not ban the import of products are rare. In December, the full ITC said it would review Pender\u2019s decision and decide whether to uphold or reverse it by late March.\n\nIn filings that became public late last week ahead of the full commission\u2019s decision, Apple for the first time said that it had developed a software fix to avoid running afoul of Qualcomm\u2019s patent. Apple said it did not discover the fix until after the trial and that it implemented the new software \u201clast fall.\u201d\n\nBut Apple said that it would need six months to verify that the fix will satisfy regulators and to sell its existing inventory. Apple asked the full commission to delay any possible import ban by that long if the commission reverses the judge\u2019s decisions.\n\nIn a filing late on Friday, Qualcomm argued that Apple\u2019s disclosure of a fix undermined the reasoning in Pender\u2019s decision and that the Intel-chipped phones should be banned while Apple deploys its fix.\n\n\u201cPender recommended against a remedy on the assumption that the (Qualcomm) patent would preclude Apple from using Intel as a supplier for many years and that no redesign was feasible,\u201d Qualcomm wrote. \u201cApple now admits\u2014more than seven months after the hearing\u2014that the alleged harm is entirely avoidable.\u201d"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-fintech-unbanked/mexico-pushes-mobile-payments-to-help-unbanked-consumers-ditch-cash-idUSKCN1Q80FN", "text": "MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexico\u2019s new leftist government is betting on financial technology to help lift people out of poverty.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A worker moves boxes with green tomatoes through the corridors of the wholesale market \"Central de Abastos\" in Mexico City, Mexico January 11, 2019. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo\n\nThe administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently announced measures aimed at making financial services more affordable in a nation where more than half the population is unbanked.\n\nIt is planning a digital payments system run and built by the central bank that will allow Mexicans to make and receive payments through their smartphones free of charge. A pilot roll-out for the platform, known as CoDi, is expected by March.\n\n\u201cIn the future, it will no longer be necessary to have a bank in the sense of a traditional, established bank,\u201d said Arturo Herrera, Mexico\u2019s deputy finance minister. \u201cMobile phones will become banks.\u201d\n\nPhone-based banking has proven a hit among the poor in other emerging markets such as China, India and Kenya. Those efforts have been driven by private sector companies that offer user-friendly, affordable apps.\n\nWhether Mexico\u2019s state system will prove as nimble and easy to use remains to be seen. And it will initially require help from the very same banks that for decades have shut out low-income Mexicans with pricey fees.\n\nOther hurdles include Mexico\u2019s spotty telecoms. While cell phone and internet coverage have improved in recent years, basic infrastructure is still missing in many remote areas.\n\n\u201cMexico has a lot of the key ingredients to succeed, but it\u2019s not plug and play,\u201d said Monica Brand Engel, a partner at Quona Capital, a global venture capital firm that invests in fintechs focused on the unbanked in emerging markets.\n\nCATCH-22\n\nAn estimated 42 million Mexicans lack bank accounts. Steep fees and past scandals have put many off the country\u2019s mainstream banks. Many shun accounts to stay off the radar of tax collectors.\n\nThat hobbles Mexico\u2019s growth. Coffee farmer Martin Romero is a prime example of why.\n\nHis small town in the state of Oaxaca, one of Mexico\u2019s poorest, has no bank branch. Romero is paid in cash. He travels hours to pay bills and is unable to save or borrow for larger expenses.\n\n\u201cOf course I would like a bank account,\u201d Romero said. \u201cThat way we could save at least a little of what we earn.\u201d\n\nWhile many Mexicans applaud Lopez Obrador\u2019s push, some fintech executives are grumbling about getting shut out of the loop.\n\nTo use CoDi, consumers must have an account with an institution participating in Mexico\u2019s existing interbank payments system, which will power the new platform.\n\nJaime Cortina, director of operations and payments at the central bank, said the goal was to develop a payment method that Mexicans could use to make payments between each other, in shops and online.\n\nCurrent members of the system include established institutions such as BBVA\u2019s Bancomer, Banco Santander and Citigroup Inc\u2019s Citibanamex. Fintechs that want to join need an electronic payment institution license, a process that new players fear could take up to a year.\n\nThat presents unbanked Mexicans with a bizarre Catch-22: To access the government\u2019s free mobile payments system, at least initially, they would have to open accounts with banks that many do not want to join or cannot afford in the first place.\n\nAdolfo Babatz, CEO of payments startup Clip, said Mexico\u2019s government should be looking to fintech entrepreneurs to bring true innovation to the financial system, not banks that have benefited from high barriers to entry. His Mexico City-based company has created a low-cost mobile credit card reader that fits on smartphones.\n\nMexico should \u201clook at the examples from the rest of the world,\u201d Babatz said.\n\nIn Kenya, for example, mobile payment system M-Pesa was launched in 2007 by a private company, mobile network operator Safaricom. M-Pesa is now a surrogate bank account for millions of users. In China, hundreds of millions of previously unbanked consumers have flocked to Alipay, the payment app owned by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial.\n\nGRAY ECONOMY\n\nLow-cost banking alone may do little to lure Mexicans out of the shadows. Nearly 57 percent work off the books, according to government data. An estimated 90 percent of transactions are done in cash.\n\n\u201cPeople who work and live in the informal economy do not want to be taxed,\u201d said Carlos Lopez, director for retail strategy and new digital business at Mexico\u2019s largest bank, BBVA Bancomer.\n\nHerrera, the deputy finance minister, told Reuters the government is making efforts to reduce cash in circulation to cut down on money laundering and corruption, and to draw more people into the formal economy.\n\nHe said the administration plans to transition to direct deposit or digital wallets to dispense welfare benefits over the next 18 months. At present, many Mexicans rely on government-issued cards that can be used at ATMs to withdraw their benefits in cash.\n\nHe also expressed optimism that fintechs would bring needed competition to the money transfer business, reducing the cost of remittances sent home by Mexicans abroad.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBut even in cosmopolitan Mexico City, a future of cashless payments seems far off for people such as Paula Martinez.

For a select group of institutions, consistently high performance on these measures confers standing among the Top 100.\n\nAs with previous Reuters listings, including coverage of the most innovative universities in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, this latest installment draws upon on a range of Clarivate Analytics information tools. These include the Web of Science Core Collection and its coverage of more than 20,000 scholarly journals and other sources, along with Derwent World Patents Index, a compilation of data from 50 worldwide patent-issuing authorities, and Derwent Patents Citation Index, which measures the influence of patents by tracking how frequently other patents explicitly cite them. In this latest global listing, both the publication and patent output reflect the years 2011 to 2016, with citations recorded through March of 2018.\n\nTo narrow the analysis to institutions with substantial records in numbers of filed patents and patent-citation activity, an initial threshold was set for universities named as assignees on 70 or more world patents between 2011 and 2016.\n\nPatenting Prowess\n\nAfter ascertaining the number of patents associated with each university, analysts tracked the outcomes, as well as the worldwide reach, of those patents. The \u201cPatent Success\u201d metric, for example, evaluates the percentage of the university\u2019s patent applications that have been successfully granted. Another measure, \u201cGlobal Patents,\u201d specifies the percentage of patents the university has filed with US, European, or Japanese patent offices. Because the international patent-application process is expensive and time consuming to pursue, an institution\u2019s willingness to do so indicates particular belief in the commercial viability and potential value of an invention.\n\nTo assess the overall influence of patents in ongoing research and development, the analysis also focused on the extent to which a university\u2019s patents are cited by other patents (including measurements that reflect both a university\u2019s total portfolio as well as individual patents). Each university\u2019s research publications were also examined in this context, with evaluation of how many times, on average, a school\u2019s research papers have been cited by patents. Such a pattern indicates a clear link between a university\u2019s basic research and its influence in applied technology.\n\nThe universities\u2019 published papers were also analyzed from another angle, to determine the percentage that listed at least one coauthor affiliated with a commercial or industrial firm, thereby demonstrating consistent partnerships outside academia. For an additional view of influence beyond the university walls, another measurement determined the average number of times an article was cited by papers that were written exclusively by industry-affiliated authors.\n\nUltimately, according to performance on these various measures, analysts calculated a combined score for each university, and the ranking of the top 100 performers was set.\n\nSteadfast Top Trio\n\nIn the latest tabulation, first-place Stanford is not alone in its consistently strong performance. In fact, the top three finishers \u2013 Stanford, MIT at #2, and #3 Harvard \u2013 have maintained their respective placements for all four annual installments of the ranking.\n\n\u2026the top three finishers \u2013 Stanford, MIT at #2, and #3 Harvard \u2013 have maintained their respective placements for all four annual installments of the ranking.\u201d\n\nAlong with the first three, five of last year\u2019s top 10 institutions return to the upper rungs, with additions being Imperial College London (at #8) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (#9).

Also notable is a jump by the UK\u2019s University of Manchester, up 27 spots from #80 to #53.\n\nIn terms of overall national representation in the ranking, summarized below, the United States, while retaining the top spot with 46 universities, is slightly down from last year\u2019s tally of 49.

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach/File Photo\n\nThe most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world\u2019s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology\n\nOverall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year\u2019s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium\u2019s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.\n\nIn contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea\u2019s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.\n\nOverall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities \u2013 traditionally the research powerhouses of the region \u2013 depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.\n\nAccording to data from Clarivate Analytics\u2019 Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.\n\nOf course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China\u2019s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.\n\nTo compile the 2017 ranking of the world\u2019s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations \u2013 including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs \u2013 that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution\u2019s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.\n\nCareful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters\u2019 regional innovation lists, Asia\u2019s Most Innovative Universities and Europe\u2019s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution\u2019s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.\n\nDue to changes in the methodology of this year\u2019s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities \u2013 the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) \u2013 made the top 100 for the first time.\n\nOf course, the relative ranking of any university \u2013 or whether it appears on the list at all \u2013 does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world\u2019s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it\u2019s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it\u2019s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.\n\nClick here for the full methodology.\n\n(Editing by Arlyn Tobias Gajilan and Alessandra Rafferty)\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asiapac-reuters-ranking-innovative-un/asia-pacifics-most-innovative-universities-2018-idUSKCN1J02SP", "text": "(Reuters) - Every scientist hopes for a \"Eureka\" moment \u2014 the jolt of sudden insight when a discovery becomes clear.

KAIST once again earned its first-place rank among the APAC\u2019s most innovative universities by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than any other university on the list, and those patents are frequently cited by outside researchers in their own patents and papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific\u2019s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.\n\nJapan\u2019s University of Tokyo takes the runner-up spot, moving up one rank from 2017. Korea\u2019s POSTECH takes third, also moving up one, and Seoul National University comes in fourth after dropping two. Tsinghua University (#5) is the highest-ranked university in China, up one from last year. Osaka University (#6), Kyoto University (#7), Sungkyunkwan University (#8), Tohoku University (#9) and the National University of Singapore (#10) round out the top 10.\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS TOP 75 Compare Institutions | Methodology\n\nOnly three new institutions appear on the list this year, all of them based in China: the China University of Mining & Technology (#56), Shandong University (#67), and Xiamen University (#74). The region exhibits a remarkable consistency, unlike Europe and North America: In contrast, Reuters\u2019 2018 ranking of Europe's Most Innovative Universities featured 15 new entries.\n\nOverall, the same countries that dominate Asian business and politics dominate the ranking of APAC\u2019s Most Innovative Universities. Chinese universities account for 27 of the 75 institutions on the list, more than any other country. South Korea comes in second with 20 institutions, and Japan is third with 19. Australia has 5, Singapore has 2, and India and New Zealand each have 1.\n\nIn addition to adding the list\u2019s only new universities, China saw its domination of the list increase slightly, from 25 institutions in 2017 to 27 in 2018. They\u2019ve done this by increasing their patent input dramatically. In 2016 ranked Chinese institutions filed an average of 128 patents during the list\u2019s five year window; in 2018, they filed 160. That\u2019s a 25% increase in just three years. Still, the nation continues to be held back by how rarely it files patents abroad. On average, Chinese universities on the list filed just 6.7% of all their patents with global authorities in the U.S., Europe and Japan, compared to 34.9% for Japanese universities and 20% for all non-Chinese universities in the ranking. Experts say Chinese academic and commercial institution are filing more patent applications than they used to. \u201cTwenty years ago China was viewed as a pirate nation when it comes to IP, but that is changing,\u201d says Mark A. Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School and director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science, and Technology. \u201cThe Chinese government has decided to push innovation, perhaps for economic reasons and perhaps for strategic ones.... [and] patenting follows from that.\u201d\n\nSome nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world\u2019s second-largest population (more than 1.28 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, the Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren\u2019t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.\n\nTo compile the 2018 ranking of the Asia Pacific region\u2019s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2011 and 2016. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution\u2019s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.\n\nOf course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers\u2019 work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world\u2019s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it\u2019s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it\u2019s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.\n\nTo see the full methodology, visit https://reut.rs/2Ja1R4S.\n\n(Editing by Arlyn Gajilan and Alessandra Rafferty)\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emea-reuters-ranking-innovative-unive/europes-most-innovative-universities-2018-idUSKBN1HW0B4", "text": "For the third year running KU Leuven tops Reuters ranking of Europe\u2019s most innovative universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.

That\u2019s one of the key criteria in Reuters\u2019 ranking, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of patent filings and research paper citations.\n\n1. The library of the university KU Leuven \"Katholieke Universiteit Leuven\" is pictured in Leuven, Belgium, June 8, 2016. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nOverall, the most elite ranks of Europe\u2019s Most Innovative Universities have held steady from last year, with the UK\u2019s Imperial College London (#2) and University of Cambridge (#3) holding onto their top spots for the third straight year. Other leading institutions simply traded a few spaces, like the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (#4, up one), University of Erlangen Nuremberg (#5, up one), and the Technical University of Munich (#6, down two). The remainder of the universities in the top 10 moved up from the teens: The University of Manchester (#7, up nine), University of Munich (#8, up four), Technical University of Denmark (#9, up five), and ETH Zurich (#10, up one).\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology\n\nBut even though the usual suspects continue to dominate Europe\u2019s Most Innovative Universities, political uncertainty may be causing a big swing in where innovation happens. The trend is most clear if you consider the sum of changes in rank for each country\u2019s institutions: The 23 German universities on this year\u2019s list cumulatively rose 23 spots, more than any other country. Switzerland was second, with five universities up a total of 8 spots. And in contrast, the list\u2019s 21 UK-based universities dropped a cumulative 35 spots.\n\nWhy is this shift occurring? The United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d from the European Union is almost a year away, but Europe\u2019s scientific community may already be leaving the UK in favor of research institutions on the continent. A February 2018 study published by the UK-based Centre for Global Higher Education reports that many German academics view Brexit as an \u201cadvantage,\u201d and hope to use it to attract UK researchers to German universities; in turn, UK academics report that their own postdocs aren\u2019t seeking positions in the UK and are looking at the EU or United States instead. And as Brexit actually unfolds, it could get worse: A November 2017 study performed by the School of International Futures for the UK\u2019s Royal Society describes a possible post-secession United Kingdom where universities compete for a shrinking pool of skilled workers, projects that used to receive EU funding wither, researchers receive fewer invites to join consortia and attend conferences, and overseas collaboration is limited. Similarly, EU-based businesses that fund research at universities may prefer to keep their investments within the region in order to avoid the tax and regulatory headaches of working with post-Brexit UK institutions.\n\nThe government of Germany has also established itself as notably pro-science, increasing federal research budgets and encouraging growth in emerging industries such as renewable energy. (German Chancellor Angela Merkel actually holds a doctorate in quantum chemistry, and worked as a research scientist before she entered politics.) According to a 2017 analysis published in the science journal \u201cNature,\u201d researchers are \u201cflocking to the country,\u201d in part due to the country\u2019s \u20ac4.6-billion \u201cExcellence Initiative,\u201d which has helped to attract at least 4,000 foreign scientists to Germany since 2005. And in 2016, the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, or DFG), the country\u2019s main funding agency, allocated a record \u20ac2.9 billion in grants, posting a success rate for individual grant proposals higher than comparable UK rates.\n\nThis year\u2019s university ranking also shows how smaller countries can have an outsized presence in the world of innovation. Belgium has seven schools on the list, but with a population of only 11 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Switzerland, followed by Denmark, the Netherlands, and the Republic of Ireland. And some large countries underperform despite bigger populations and economies. Russia is Europe\u2019s most populous country and boasts the region\u2019s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100.\n\nTo compile the ranking of Europe\u2019s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions.

Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.\n\nOf course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world\u2019s most innovative oncology research centers, for instance. And it\u2019s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it\u2019s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.\n\nTo see the full methodology, click here.\n\n(Editing by Arlyn Gajilan and Alessandra Rafferty)\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/video/2019/01/28/brooklyn-grocer-goes-packaging-free?videoId=508863563&videoChannel=118207", "text": "It's the next step after ditching plastic; the Precycle market has opened in New York with the motto, 'Just food.

Alle Autolieferungen aus Deutschland in den Rest der Welt w\u00fcrden sich um rund acht Prozent verringern, was einem Wert von 18,4 Milliarden Euro entspr\u00e4che. Die Wertsch\u00f6pfung der Autoindustrie in Deutschland w\u00fcrde um sieben Milliarden Euro sinken.

Trumps Ank\u00fcndigung h\u00f6herer Z\u00f6lle habe eine \u201cpolitische Instabilit\u00e4t\u201d geschaffen, sagte er der Zeitung. Die Autobauer selbst k\u00f6nnten wenig dazu beitragen, den US-Pr\u00e4sidenten von seinen Pl\u00e4nen abzubringen. Dies sei Sache von Verhandlungen zwischen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und den Vereinigten Staaten.

Selbst bei einem harten Brexit w\u00fcrden die Autoverk\u00e4ufe nicht v\u00f6llig zum Stillstand kommen. Sie w\u00fcrden allerdings stark zur\u00fcckgehen.

If she fails, May will have to decide whether to delay Brexit or endanger the world\u2019s fifth largest economy by leaving without a deal on March 29.\n\nMay\u2019s finance minister, Philip Hammond, raised hopes that a revised deal was on the cards by saying lawmakers could get an opportunity as early as next week to vote on a revised deal.\n\nBut within hours of his comments, a British government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, played down the likelihood of a deal within days.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like we will have a deal by next week,\u201d the source said.\n\nMay\u2019s biggest problem is the so-called Irish backstop, an insurance policy to keep the border open between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland if a future trade deal falls short after Brexit.\n\nParliament instructed her to replace the backstop by reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, but the EU ruled that out.\n\nBritain\u2019s Brexit ministry said after talks in Brussels on Thursday that negotiations were now focused on getting new guarantees on the temporary nature of the Irish backstop.\n\nIn a statement after Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox met EU negotiator Michel Barnier, the ministry gave a clear indication that May was no longer pushing to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, even if that remained the government\u2019s preferred option.\n\n\u201cThe simplest way to get legally binding changes on the backstop is to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. That remains the Government\u2019s position,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nBut, referring to talks on Wednesday between May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, it said the two leaders \u201cagreed that work would now focus on guarantees relating to the backstop that underline once again its temporary nature and give appropriate legal assurance to both sides, as well as alternative arrangements and the political declaration.\u201d\n\nDiplomats said the two sides were moving towards a separate legal statement - a \u201cparallel declaration\u201d or \u201cinterpretative instrument\u201d - on the backstop.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking at updating the declaration on future EU-UK ties after Brexit to give more prominence to the \u2018alternative arrangements\u2019 sought by Britain,\u201d said one EU diplomat who deals with Brexit.\n\n\u201cBut May won\u2019t get any firm wording before Feb. 28.\u201d\n\nBarclay, Barnier and Cox were due to continue talks \u201curgently\u201d at a technical level, the UK\u2019s Brexit ministry said.\n\nBREXIT COMPROMISE?\n\nLegal assurances that the backstop is temporary would address a key concern of many Brexit-supporting members of her party who fear it could lock Britain into EU rules indefinitely.\n\nBrexit-supporting members of May\u2019s Conservative Party have been conspicuous by their silence about the shift from aiming to replace the backstop, as they demanded, to a legal addendum.\n\nMay, once a reluctant supporter of EU membership who won the top job in the political chaos following the 2016 referendum, has promised to give lawmakers a chance to decide what to do about Brexit on Feb. 27 unless she can bring back a deal.\n\nA second diplomat, briefed on the May-Juncker talks, confirmed the EU would only signal this was the direction of travel, rather than offering a precise text, before May faces another vote in parliament.\n\n\u201cThe parliament needs first to indicate clearly this option would then gain their support in the form of ratifying the Brexit deal. If they do that, we hone out exact words in the second week of March and it goes to the summit for approval.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, the summit of all EU national leaders that is due on March 21-22 in Brussels, would have to agree a Brexit delay for Britain beyond March 29, sources in the bloc said, to delay the worst-case scenario of an abrupt split without a deal.\n\nMay will have a further chance to lobby EU leaders at the weekend in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh during an EU-Arab League summit focused on migration, trade and security.\n\nBritish lawmakers voted 432-202 against her deal on Jan. 15, the worst defeat in modern British parliamentary history.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond is seen outside Downing Street in London, Britain January 30, 2019.

It could lead to nowhere, it could become a footnote in the history of Brexit, or it could become the beginnings of the break-up of the party system which has been going for the last 100 years,\u201d said Tony Wright, Emeritus Professor of Government and Public Policy at UCL university.\n\n\u201cThey need numbers. You\u2019re going to need some cabinet resignations, that would really set things moving.\u201d\n\nJust 36 days from Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to find a divorce deal with the EU that parliament will approve, leaving the world\u2019s fifth largest economy and all its global investors staring down the barrel of a potentially chaotic exit.\n\nOver three days of high political theatre in London this week, three members of May\u2019s right-leaning Conservative Party and eight from the leftist Labour opposition have quit their parties to become independent lawmakers.\n\nIt is already the most significant breakaway group in almost four decades for a parliament in which the two main parties have formed the government of the day for almost a century, largely restricting smaller groups to the political fringes.\n\nThe defectors, now known as \u2018The Independent Group\u2019, say their old parties have been hijacked by far-left and far-right factions, leaving the centre ground of British politics unmanned and powerless to exert its influence.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t join a political party to fight it, and you don\u2019t stay in it and skirmish in the margins when the truth is the battle is over and the other side has won,\u201d said Anna Soubry, the one-time Conservative minister who resigned on Wednesday.\n\nNO CHANGE TO BREXIT ARITHMETIC\n\nBrexit has proved to be the tipping point.\n\nThe 2016 referendum that split the country 52-48 percent in favour of leaving also divided both main political parties, drawing a new battle line in parliament between \u2018Leavers\u2019 and \u2018Remainers\u2019 that cuts right through traditional party loyalties.\n\nWhile the country is divided over EU membership, most agree it is at a crossroads and that its choices over Brexit will shape the prosperity of future generations.\n\nMay has failed to rally eurosceptic and pro-EU wings of her party around a common position on how best to leave the bloc. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been accused by critics of equivocation and a lack of clear direction.\n\n\u201cIf Brexit was a pained clarion call for change, then we hear it,\u201d said Heidi Allen, another of the former Conservative lawmakers.\n\n\u201cOur parties have been unable to grasp the magnitude of the challenge and have no plan to respond, nor heal the division across our cities, our villages and our dining tables.\u201d\n\nThe party discipline that typically prevails and helps the government set policy has broken down. Positions are entrenched, rebellions are commonplace, and the government has become accustomed to losing votes. Policymaking on all fronts has ground to a halt.\n\nTherein lies both the difficulty and the opportunity for the new group.\n\nThe now-independent lawmakers were already voting against the government, so their resignation has not changed the arithmetic in a parliament which won\u2019t approve May\u2019s Brexit deal, but can\u2019t agree on what alternative path it wants to pursue.\n\nThe group knows it can only capitalise on widespread frustration over this stalemate and fears over the ticking Brexit clock if they succeed in convincing others there is a viable alternative to the two positions offered by Labour and the Conservatives.\n\n\u201cWe have taken the first step in leaving the old tribal politics behind and we invite others who share our political values to do so too,\u201d said former Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna, who resigned on Monday.\n\nSECOND REFERENDUM\n\nThe lawmakers have not yet formed a new party with an agreed set of policies and positions on key issues. But their future will almost certainly be defined by Brexit, and they do not have much time to make an impact.\n\nAlmost all the group\u2019s members are clear that they do not want Britain to leave the EU without a deal, and they do want to hold a second referendum.\n\nOne or both of those views are shared by many in parliament, including ministers who have so far remained loyal to May and voted in favour of her deal despite their reservations.\n\nBut even in government, patience is wearing thin.\n\nOne minister who declined to be named, told Reuters prior to the defections that he was ready to vote against the government and face the sack if May hadn\u2019t made any progress on a deal. Several other have signalled publicly they could do the same.\n\nTheir loyalty is set to be tested next week when May either returns to parliament with a revised Brexit deal, or to set out what progress she has made towards one. Lawmakers will have a chance to vote on what happens next.\n\nFILE PHOTO: British and EU flags flutter outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain January 30, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nThose votes could see May\u2019s deal rejected and parliament handed an opportunity to seize control of the process and use it to rule out a no-deal exit and delay Britain\u2019s departure.\n\nFor The Independent Group this will be a defining moment to swell their ranks and reach the critical mass they need to attract the funding required to build a political party capable of fighting an election.\n\n\u201cFrankly if we have got the courage to do this, they can follow that.

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nMay wants to negotiate changes to the exit deal she agreed with the EU last year and bring it back for approval in parliament as soon as possible.\n\nAlthough diplomats said progress was being made towards a solution to British concerns about the deal, both sides talked down the prospect of an agreement in time for May to hold a vote on a new package next week.\n\nIf May cannot bring a deal back next week, she has promised to make a statement to parliament on her progress on Feb. 26, and then to allow lawmakers to debate the issue on Feb. 27.\n\nThis will not involve a vote on whether to approve or reject a Brexit deal. But it will allow lawmakers to put forward alternative courses of action and test support for them with a series of votes. There is expected to be an attempt to shift control of the talks out of May\u2019s hands.\n\nWHAT WILL THEY DEBATE?\n\nLawmakers will debate a government statement. It is not yet known what this motion will say.\n\nCAN LAWMAKERS PROPOSE CHANGES?\n\nYes. They are known as amendments and, if approved by a vote, could change the course of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. The details of amendments have not been published, but some lawmakers have signalled their intentions.\n\nWHAT CAN WE EXPECT?\n\nThe likely focus of the Feb. 27 debate will be whether parliament should take control of the exit process from the government, a radical plan rejected in a slightly different form on Jan. 29.\n\nBut, with the clock ticking down towards the March 29 exit date, a growing number of lawmakers in May\u2019s Conservative Party are worried about the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal and are considering whether to support the latest version of the plan.\n\nHOW CAN PARLIAMENT TAKE CONTROL?\n\nThere are several stages to the plan, which has been put forward by Yvette Cooper, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, with the backing of members from different parties.\n\nThe first step would be to use an amendment to force the government to allow time in parliament to discuss a piece of legislation known as a bill.\n\nThis bill, if approved by parliament, would create a law designed to add safeguards to prevent Britain from leaving the EU without a deal. It would not automatically stop or delay Brexit, but could force the government\u2019s next steps.\n\nWHAT SAFEGUARDS?\n\nAccording to Cooper\u2019s office, the bill will propose:\n\n- If a deal has not been agreed by mid-March, May has to bring a motion to parliament on either:\n\ni) a plan to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit on March 29, or\n\nii) a plan to extend the negotiations and for how long.\n\n- Parliament should be able to debate and vote on her plan on the same day.\n\n- If May wants to go ahead with no deal rather than extend Article 50, she needs a majority in parliament.\n\n- If lawmakers reject no deal, then May has to come forward the next day with a proposal to extend the negotiating period.\n\n- If parliament agrees to May seeking an extension, she has to negotiate that extension with the EU.\n\nWILL IT WORK?\n\nThe first stage is winning a vote in parliament on Feb. 27.\n\nThe plan is likely to be endorsed by the Labour Party, other small parties in parliament and pro-EU members of May\u2019s party. Several government ministers have indicated they will consider supporting the plan even if it means they have to resign or be sacked.\n\nMay does not have an outright majority in parliament and is vulnerable to defeat if only a handful of her own party rebel. However, some in the Labour Party would probably vote against the plan, increasing the size of the rebellion needed.\n\nBeyond that, there are several more hurdles to clear before it becomes law, including passing contentious legislation that would usually take months in a very short space of time - possibly just a single day.\n\nBut, if this succeeds, it will create a significant barrier to May proceeding with a no-deal exit without lawmakers\u2019 consent. Parliament has on previous occasions voted symbolically to say it does not want to leave without a deal.\n\nWHAT DO OPPONENTS SAY?\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers, mostly from May\u2019s Conservative Party, argue that the possibility of leaving without a deal would be damaging for the EU and is therefore an important bargaining chip for Britain. They would likely oppose anything which could remove that option from negotiations.\n\nSome argue leaving the bloc without a deal is preferable to leaving with a deal that would keep Britain in a close relationship with the EU, and that any short term economic disruption would be outweighed by long term benefits."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-china-deal-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-china-sketch-outlines-of-deal-to-end-trade-war-sources-idUKKCN1QA07Y", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China have started to outline commitments in principle on the stickiest issues in their trade dispute, marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThe world\u2019s two largest economies have slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, slowing global economic growth, skewing supply chains and disrupting manufacturing.\n\nAs officials hold high-level talks on Thursday and Friday in Washington, they remain far apart on demands made by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration for structural changes to China\u2019s economy.\n\nBut the broad outline of what could make up a deal is beginning to emerge from the talks, the sources said, as the two sides push for an agreement by March 1. That marks the end of a 90-day truce that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to when they met in Argentina late last year.\n\nNegotiators are drawing up six memorandums of understanding on structural issues: forced technology transfer and cyber theft, intellectual property rights, services, currency, agriculture, and non-tariff barriers to trade, according to two sources familiar with the progress of the talks.\n\nAt meetings between U.S. and Chinese officials last week in Beijing the two sides traded texts and worked on outlining obligations on paper, according to one of the sources.\n\nThe process has become a real trade negotiation, the source said, so much so that at the end of the week the participants considered staying in Beijing to keep working. Instead they agreed to take a few days off and reconvene in Washington.\n\nThe sources requested anonymity to speak candidly about the talks.\n\nChinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng on Thursday declined to comment on the MOUs.\n\nU.S. equity index futures initially rallied on the news of progress in the talks, with the S&P 500\u2019s e-mini futures contract gaining about 0.4 percent over the following hour during Asian trading. The dollar strengthened and U.S. Treasury security yields rose.\n\nU.S. stocks later retreated in Thursday\u2019s Wall Street session following a batch of weaker-than-expected economic data, though the dollar and bond yields remained modestly higher.\n\nGETTING COMMITMENTS IN WRITING\n\nThe MOUs cover the most complex issues affecting the trading relationship between the two countries and are meant, from the U.S. perspective, to end the practices that led Trump to start levying duties on Chinese imports in the first place.\n\nOne source cautioned that the talks could still end in failure. But the work on the MOUs was a significant step in getting China to sign up both to broad principles and to specific commitments on key issues, he said.\n\nSeveral Chinese government sources told Reuters that the two countries have basically reached a consensus on alleviating the trade imbalances, but there were still some differences on each other\u2019s \u201ccore demands\u201d that they were seeking to narrow.\n\n\u201cIt can be said that we are now in the sprint phase, and both negotiating teams are working towards the goal of reaching an agreement within the deadline, but some problems are still quite complicated to resolve,\u201d said one Chinese official familiar with the situation.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Chinese staffers adjust U.S. and Chinese flags before the opening session of trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Thursday, Feb. 14, 2019.

China denies it engages in such practices.\n\nTrump administration officials also object to non-tariff barriers in China, including industrial subsidies, regulations, business licensing procedures, product standards reviews and other practices that they say keep U.S. goods out of China or give an unfair advantage to domestic firms.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for China to open its financial services markets to more foreign firms, including major credit card companies Visa and MasterCard, which have waited years for China to make good on promises to allow them to operate there.\n\nOn currency, U.S. officials including Mnuchin have warned China against devaluing its yuan to gain a competitive advantage after the Chinese currency weakened significantly against the dollar last year, partly counteracting Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nThe two sides were discussing an enforcement mechanism for the deal, the source said. Reuters reported last month that the United States was pushing for regular reviews of China\u2019s progress on pledged trade reforms and could reinstate tariffs if it deems Beijing has violated the agreement.\n\nThe parties also were looking at a 10-item list of ways that China could reduce its trade surplus with the United States, including by buying agricultural produce, energy and goods such as semiconductors, according to two other sources familiar with the talks.\n\nCLOCK IS TICKING\n\nTime is running short ahead of the March 1 deadline to resolve the dispute or see U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods rise from 10 percent to 25 percent. Trump said on Tuesday he thought China had an incentive to move swiftly.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to move fast so that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office, while not ruling out the possibility of extending the deadline.\n\nFILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, left, listens as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He talks while they line up for a group photo at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China February 15, 2019.

REUTERS/Alessia Pierdomenico/File Photo\n\nThat\u2019s unlikely, say competition lawyers, analysts and company insiders, so the proposal will most likely fail.\n\nThe Competition and Market Authority\u2019s (CMA) provisional view, published on Wednesday, was the deal should be blocked in the absence of the sale of a large number of stores, or even one of the brands.\n\nIt acknowledged the two companies were unlikely to be able to address its concerns.\n\n\u201cThe only way you get there is you have to have the CMA do a fundamental u-turn on the way they\u2019ve appraised it,\u201d said one person familiar with Sainsbury\u2019s thinking. \u201cAnd if they (the CMA) are playing the politics, then there\u2019s no chance they\u2019re going to do that.\u201d\n\nSainsbury and Asda have until March 13 to respond to the CMA\u2019s provisional findings and until March 6 to respond to its suggested divestment remedies. The CMA will then publish its final report by April 30.\n\nCompetition lawyers said there are few precedents for the CMA to dramatically revise its findings between provisional and final reports.\n\nSainsbury and Asda\u2019s key argument has been that Britain\u2019s grocery market is changing rapidly, driven by the growth of online and a broader range of competitors, most notably discounters Aldi and Lidl.\n\nHowever, the CMA effectively said that while new entrants are a force, it is the big four grocers - market leader Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons - who are most in competition with each other, making the Sainsbury-Asda deal a \u201cfour to three\u201d merger.\n\nLawyers said Sainsbury and Asda would have to come up with new evidence to change the CMA\u2019s thinking.\n\nWRONG FIGURES\n\n\u201cSainsbury\u2019s-Asda would need to pull something out of the bag, or they\u2019d need to show that the CMA has completely got its figures wrong,\u201d said Alex Haffner, partner and head of competition at law firm Fladgate LLP.\n\n\u201cAll they can realistically hope to achieve between now and the CMA\u2019s reporting deadline is to eat away at the size of the divestments required. They are undoubtedly facing an uphill challenge to make it work,\u201d Haffner said.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays said prior to Wednesday\u2019s ruling they had assumed a 67 percent chance of the deal proceeding. They now see a minimal chance of success.\n\nThey highlighted the CMA\u2019s view that any \u201cremedy stores\u201d would have to be sold to a single buyer, would have to be solely Sainsbury\u2019s or solely Asda\u2019s, not a mix, and be accompanied by the sale of either the Sainsbury or Asda brand name.\n\n\u201cAny one of these constraints would be painful - together they leave us sceptical that any viable package could be found,\u201d they said, arguing Amazon was the only company they could imagine being interested in buying so many stores.\n\nBut they cautioned that facilitating Amazon\u2019s scaling up in UK grocery might cost Sainsbury more in the long term. Amazon declined to comment.\n\nIf the CMA\u2019s final report differs little from its provisional findings, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda\u2019s last chance would be to challenge the ruling through the Competition Appeal Tribunal, a specialist judicial body.\n\nSainsbury Chief Executive Mike Coupe has said the company would take that route if it believed any ruling was not backed up by published evidence.\n\nCoupe, as the architect of the deal, could come under investor pressure if it fails. However, analysts speculated Sainsbury would be reluctant to jettison him given Chairman David Tyler is due to step down in March, or soon after, to be succeeded by Martin Scicluna.\n\nMeanwhile failure of the deal would block one potential exit route from Britain for Walmart. Analysts have said the U.S. group might instead consider a stock market listing of Asda or try to sell it to private equity."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-britain-teenager/islamic-state-teen-begum-asks-uk-to-show-more-mercy-sky-news-idUKKCN1QA2MX", "text": "FILE PHOTO: Renu Begum, sister of teenage British girl Shamima Begum, holds a photo of her sister as she makes an appeal for her to return home at Scotland Yard, in London, Britain February 22, 2015.

Since 2016, his administration has purchased 17 tonnes of the metal worth around $650 million from so-called artisan miners, according to the most recent data from the nation\u2019s central bank.\n\nPaid with the country\u2019s near-worthless bank notes, these amateurs in turn supply the government with hard currency to purchase badly needed imports of food and hygiene products. This gold trade is a blip on international markets. Still, the United States is using sanctions and intimidation in an effort to stop Maduro from using his nation\u2019s gold to stay afloat.\n\nThe Trump administration is pressuring the United Kingdom not to release $1.2 billion in gold reserves Venezuela has stored in the Bank of England. U.S. officials recently castigated an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm for its Venezuela gold purchases, and have warned other potential foreign buyers to back off.\n\nThe existence of Maduro\u2019s gold program is well-known. How it functions is not.\n\nTo get a glimpse inside, Reuters tracked Venezuela\u2019s gold from steamy jungle mines, through the central bank in the capital of Caracas to gold refineries and food exporters abroad, speaking with more than 30 people with knowledge of the trade. They included miners, intermediaries, merchants, academic researchers, diplomats and government officials. Almost all requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, or because they feared retribution from Venezuelan or U.S. authorities.\n\nWhat emerges is the portrait of a desperate experiment in laissez-faire industrial policy by Venezuela\u2019s socialist leaders. U.S. sanctions have hammered the nation\u2019s oil industry and crippled its ability to borrow. The formal mining sector has been decimated by nationalization. So Maduro has unleashed freelance prospectors to extract the nation\u2019s mineral wealth with virtually no regulation or state investment.\n\nThe Bolivarian Revolution now leans heavily on ragtag laborers such as Jose Aular, a teenager who says he has contracted malaria five times at a wildcat mine near Venezuela\u2019s border with Brazil. Aular works 12 hours daily lugging sacks of earth to a small mill that uses toxic mercury to extract flecks of precious metal. Mining accidents are common in these ramshackle operations, workers said. So are shootings and robberies.\n\n\u201cThe government knows what happens in these mines and it benefits from it,\u201d said Aular, 18. \u201cOur gold goes into their hands.\u201d\n\nMaduro has also received a crucial assist from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a fellow strongman who has likewise sparred with the Trump administration.\n\nVenezuela exports part of its gold to Turkey, then uses some of the proceeds to buy that nation\u2019s consumer goods, according to opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni. Turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in Maduro\u2019s subsidized food program. Trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year.\n\nBut scrutiny is intensifying as Venezuela\u2019s politics reach the boiling point. In recent days, many Western countries have recognized Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American nation\u2019s rightful president.\n\nMaduro\u2019s adversaries have called on foreign buyers of Venezuela\u2019s precious metal to stop doing business with what they say is an illegitimate regime.\n\n\u201cWe are going to protect our gold,\u201d opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni told Reuters in an interview.\n\nGOLD FEVER\n\nThe gold road begins in places like La Culebra, an isolated jungle area in southern Venezuela. Here, hundreds of men labor in crude mining operations that would be at home in the 19th century. They excavate mineral-laden dirt with picks in hand-dug tunnels, hauling it out with pulleys and winches.\n\nTheir activity is laying waste to fragile forest ecosystems and spreading mosquito-borne diseases. Miners complain of shakedowns by military forces sent to guard the region, whose homicide rate is seven times the national average. Venezuela\u2019s ministries of defense and information did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA man melts gold at his workshop in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela August 7, 2018. REUTERS/William Urdaneta\n\nMiner Jose Rondon is used to hardship. Now 47, he arrived in 2016 from northeast Venezuela with his two adult sons. His bus driver\u2019s salary could not keep pace with Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation, which the International Monetary Fund projects will hit 10 million percent this year.\n\nThe three men net roughly 10 grams of gold monthly from backbreaking work. Still it is roughly 20 times what they could earn back home.\n\n\u201cHere I do much better,\u201d said Rondon, resting in a crude bunkhouse strung with hammocks.\n\nGold in hand, miners head to the town of El Callao to sell their nuggets. Most buyers are unlicensed, small-scale traders working in cramped shops fitted with alarms and steel doors.\n\n\u201cThe state is buying gold, everyone is buying gold, because it\u2019s what is doing well,\u201d said Jhony Diaz, a licensed wholesaler in Puerto Ordaz, 171 kilometers (106 miles) north of El Callao. Diaz says he buys gold from traders and resells every three days to the central bank.\n\nBecause Venezuela\u2019s currency, the bolivar, is worth less every hour someone holds it, the state pays a premium over international prices to make it worthwhile for those who could smuggle gold out of the country to exchange for dollars.\n\nTraders who sell to Diaz end up with bricks of cash to carry back to El Callao and other gold-rush towns to pay miners, who use it to buy food, supplies and send whatever is left to their families.\n\nGold purchased by the government is smelted in the nearby furnaces of Minerven, the state-run mining company, according to a high-ranking employee. It is then transported to the vaults of the central bank in the capital Caracas, 843 kilometers (524 miles) away.\n\nThe gold does not stay there long. The central bank\u2019s gold reserves have plummeted to their lowest levels in 75 years as it sells the gold to pay its bills. One of the main buyers of this gold is Turkey, Paparoni said.\n\nTURKISH ALLIANCE\n\nMaduro\u2019s gold program has developed in tandem with his deepening relationship with Turkey\u2019s Erdogan. Both leaders have been criticized internationally for cracking down on political dissent and undermining democratic norms to concentrate power.\n\nA Nov. 1 executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump bars U.S. persons and entities from buying gold from Venezuela. It does not apply to foreigners. Ankara has assured the U.S. Treasury that all of Turkey\u2019s trade with Venezuela is in accordance with international law.\n\nVenezuela in December 2016 announced a direct flight from Caracas to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. The development was surprising given low demand for travel between the two nations.\n\nTrade data show those planes are carrying more than passengers. On New Year\u2019s Day, 2018, Venezuela\u2019s central bank began shipping gold to Turkey with a $36 million air shipment of the metal to Istanbul. It came just weeks after a visit by Maduro to Turkey.\n\nShipments last year reached $900 million, according to Turkish government data and trade reports.\n\nSocialist Party leader Tareck El Aissami during a visit to Turkey in January said Venezuela was boosting gold sales to Turkey while seeking to increase the supply of Turkish food products to Venezuela, state-owned Turkish Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nTurkish consumer products, meanwhile, are making their way to Venezuelan tables. In early December, 54 containers of Turkish powdered milk arrived at the port of La Guaira near Caracas, according to port records seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Istanbul-based shipper, Mulberry Proje Yatirim, shares an address with Marilyns Proje Yatirim, a mining company that signed a joint venture with Venezuela\u2019s state mining firm Minerven last year, according to filings with a Turkish trade registry gazette in September.\n\nThe companies did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven Maduro\u2019s critics acknowledge he has pulled off a neat trick of alchemy: By compensating hard-pressed citizen miners with inflation-ravaged bolivars and obtaining precious metal in return, he has found a way to spin straw into gold.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nVenezuelan economist Angel Alvarado, an opposition lawmaker, said \u201cdark operations and unusual mechanisms of commercial exchange,\u201d are among the few tools Maduro has left.\n\n\u201cThere is a desperation to stay in power at all costs,\u201d Alvarado said."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-space-moon-israel/israel-set-to-join-elite-lunar-club-with-first-mission-to-moon-idUKKCN1QA2VE?il=0", "text": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

China made history in January with its Chang\u2019e 4, the first to touch down on the dark side of the moon.\n\nBeresheet would mark the first non-government lunar landing. The 1,290-pound (585-kg) spacecraft was built by Israeli nonprofit space venture SpaceIL and state-owned defence contractor Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) with $100 million furnished almost entirely by private donors.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nBeresheet is designed to spend just two to three days using on-board instruments to photograph its landing site and measure the moon\u2019s magnetic field.

For SpaceX, the report mentioned the redesign of a SpaceX rocket canister following a 2016 explosion and its \u201cload and go\u201d process of fueling the rocket with the crew already inside the capsule. \u201cParachute performance\u201d remained an issue for both companies.\n\n\u201cThere are serious challenges to the current launch schedules for both SpaceX and Boeing,\u201d the report said.\n\nFor an interactive version of this story, click tmsnrt.rs/2V6pXyN\n\nTwo people with direct knowledge of the program told Reuters that the space agency\u2019s concerns go beyond the four items listed, and include a risk ledger that as of early February contained 30 to 35 lingering technical concerns each for SpaceX and Boeing. Reuters could not verify what all of the nearly three dozen items are. But the sources familiar with the matter said the companies must address \u201cmost\u201d of those concerns before flying astronauts and, eventually, tourists to space.\n\nThe NASA risk database is updated routinely during the course of NASA\u2019s stringent certification process, which includes data collection, tests and collaboration with SpaceX and Boeing, the people said. The Boeing and SpaceX systems have already been delayed several times in recent years, which is common in this sector given the complexity of building multibillion-dollar spacecraft capable of shedding earth\u2019s gravity.\n\nNASA spokesman Joshua Finch deferred all technical questions on Boeing and SpaceX systems to the companies, citing confidentiality, but said: \u201cFlying safely always takes precedence over schedule.\u201d\n\nBoeing spokesman Josh Barrett said the company \u201cclosed out\u201d the capsule\u2019s structural vulnerability risk when it completed its structural test program in January. While Boeing is working through a number of other issues, they \u201care not driving any major architectural system changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur numbers show we are exceeding NASA\u2019s safety requirements,\u201d said Barrett.\n\nSpaceX spokesman James Gleeson said the company, working with NASA, has developed \u201cone of the safest, most-advanced human spaceflight systems ever built.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more important to SpaceX than safely flying crew,\u201d said Gleeson, calling it \u201ccore to our company\u2019s long-term goal of enabling access for people who dream of flying to space.\u201d\n\nFounded by Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, SpaceX has cut the cost of rocket launches with its pioneering reusable rocket technology, while Boeing traces its space business back to the first U.S. human space missions of the 1960s and is also the world\u2019s largest planemaker.\n\nThe clock is ticking. The U.S. has been paying Russia about $80 million per ticket for a ride to the International Space Station, a $100 billion orbital research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (402 km) above Earth.\n\nOne of Boeing Co's CST-100 Starliner astronaut capsules is seen at a production facility in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., January 15, 2019. REUTERS/Eric M. Johnson\n\nThere are no seats available for U.S. crew on the Russia spacecraft after 2019 given production schedules and other factors. NASA said last week it was considering paying for two more seats to the space station for this fall and spring 2020 to ensure U.S. access.\n\nThe NASA plan for extra seats came a week after its safety panel said Congress should come up with a \u201cmitigation plan\u201d in case delays threaten U.S. access to the space station - echoing earlier concerns from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nNASA is set to conduct a flight readiness review on Friday for SpaceX\u2019s mission without a crew on March 2. NASA will decide whether to approve the test flight without a crew, while SpaceX addresses the issues raised for a human mission.\n\nPARACHUTE WEAKNESSES\n\nThree people familiar with the project say the U.S. space agency has identified some design discrepancies between earlier SpaceX capsules designed to haul cargo to the International Space Station, and a newer version designed to carry humans.\n\nSome of the risks - such as those identified in the designs of the enormous parachutes that deploy when the capsule plummets back to Earth at supersonic speeds - are uncommon given how close SpaceX is to test flights, two of the people said.\n\nThe timing of deployment of the SpaceX parachutes and the interaction of the parachutes themselves have raised concerns about parachute performance, and potentially whether they will be able to slow down the capsule enough to ensure the crew\u2019s safety, two people said.\n\nSpaceX has completed 17 parachute tests for the Commercial Crew Program so far, with an additional 10 tests planned prior to Crew Dragon\u2019s second demonstration mission, Gleeson said. He also said its parachute systems are designed with redundancy so the vehicle can still safely splashdown in the event that one parachute fails.\n\nNASA\u2019s safety panel said in its report that SpaceX may be required to re-design its parachute system. A re-design would likely trigger more testing and potentially weeks or months of extra delays, two of the people said.\n\nNASA also found design problems with the system that helps orient SpaceX\u2019s capsule in an upright position once it lands in the ocean, raising the risk of taking on excessive amounts of water, according to two industry sources and confirmed by a NASA official.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Gleeson said Crew Dragon\u2019s outer shell is water-resistant, and the spacecraft itself is buoyant and does not pose a risk to crew members after splashdown.\n\nRISK OF MORE DELAYS\n\nNASA announced earlier this month that SpaceX was now targeting March 2 instead of Feb. 23 for its un-crewed Crew Dragon test flight, with its astronaut flight planned for July.

For SpaceX, the report mentioned the redesign of a SpaceX rocket canister following a 2016 explosion and its \u201cload and go\u201d process of fueling the rocket with the crew already inside the capsule. \u201cParachute performance\u201d remained an issue for both companies.\n\n\u201cThere are serious challenges to the current launch schedules for both SpaceX and Boeing,\u201d the report said.\n\nFor an interactive version of this story, click tmsnrt.rs/2V6pXyN\n\nTwo people with direct knowledge of the program told Reuters that the space agency\u2019s concerns go beyond the four items listed, and include a risk ledger that as of early February contained 30 to 35 lingering technical concerns each for SpaceX and Boeing. Reuters could not verify what all of the nearly three dozen items are. But the sources familiar with the matter said the companies must address \u201cmost\u201d of those concerns before flying astronauts and, eventually, tourists to space.\n\nThe NASA risk database is updated routinely during the course of NASA\u2019s stringent certification process, which includes data collection, tests and collaboration with SpaceX and Boeing, the people said. The Boeing and SpaceX systems have already been delayed several times in recent years, which is common in this sector given the complexity of building multibillion-dollar spacecraft capable of shedding earth\u2019s gravity.\n\nNASA spokesman Joshua Finch deferred all technical questions on Boeing and SpaceX systems to the companies, citing confidentiality, but said: \u201cFlying safely always takes precedence over schedule.\u201d\n\nBoeing spokesman Josh Barrett said the company \u201cclosed out\u201d the capsule\u2019s structural vulnerability risk when it completed its structural test program in January. While Boeing is working through a number of other issues, they \u201care not driving any major architectural system changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur numbers show we are exceeding NASA\u2019s safety requirements,\u201d said Barrett.\n\nSpaceX spokesman James Gleeson said the company, working with NASA, has developed \u201cone of the safest, most-advanced human spaceflight systems ever built.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more important to SpaceX than safely flying crew,\u201d said Gleeson, calling it \u201ccore to our company\u2019s long-term goal of enabling access for people who dream of flying to space.\u201d\n\nFounded by Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, SpaceX has cut the cost of rocket launches with its pioneering reusable rocket technology, while Boeing traces its space business back to the first U.S. human space missions of the 1960s and is also the world\u2019s largest planemaker.\n\nThe clock is ticking. The U.S. has been paying Russia about $80 million per ticket for a ride to the International Space Station, a $100 billion orbital research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (402 km) above Earth.\n\nOne of Boeing Co's CST-100 Starliner astronaut capsules is seen at a production facility in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., January 15, 2019. REUTERS/Eric M. Johnson\n\nThere are no seats available for U.S. crew on the Russia spacecraft after 2019 given production schedules and other factors. NASA said last week it was considering paying for two more seats to the space station for this fall and spring 2020 to ensure U.S. access.\n\nThe NASA plan for extra seats came a week after its safety panel said Congress should come up with a \u201cmitigation plan\u201d in case delays threaten U.S. access to the space station - echoing earlier concerns from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nNASA is set to conduct a flight readiness review on Friday for SpaceX\u2019s mission without a crew on March 2. NASA will decide whether to approve the test flight without a crew, while SpaceX addresses the issues raised for a human mission.\n\nPARACHUTE WEAKNESSES\n\nThree people familiar with the project say the U.S. space agency has identified some design discrepancies between earlier SpaceX capsules designed to haul cargo to the International Space Station, and a newer version designed to carry humans.\n\nSome of the risks - such as those identified in the designs of the enormous parachutes that deploy when the capsule plummets back to Earth at supersonic speeds - are uncommon given how close SpaceX is to test flights, two of the people said.\n\nThe timing of deployment of the SpaceX parachutes and the interaction of the parachutes themselves have raised concerns about parachute performance, and potentially whether they will be able to slow down the capsule enough to ensure the crew\u2019s safety, two people said.\n\nSpaceX has completed 17 parachute tests for the Commercial Crew Program so far, with an additional 10 tests planned prior to Crew Dragon\u2019s second demonstration mission, Gleeson said. He also said its parachute systems are designed with redundancy so the vehicle can still safely splashdown in the event that one parachute fails.\n\nNASA\u2019s safety panel said in its report that SpaceX may be required to re-design its parachute system. A re-design would likely trigger more testing and potentially weeks or months of extra delays, two of the people said.\n\nNASA also found design problems with the system that helps orient SpaceX\u2019s capsule in an upright position once it lands in the ocean, raising the risk of taking on excessive amounts of water, according to two industry sources and confirmed by a NASA official.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Gleeson said Crew Dragon\u2019s outer shell is water-resistant, and the spacecraft itself is buoyant and does not pose a risk to crew members after splashdown.\n\nRISK OF MORE DELAYS\n\nNASA announced earlier this month that SpaceX was now targeting March 2 instead of Feb. 23 for its un-crewed Crew Dragon test flight, with its astronaut flight planned for July. NASA explained the delay by citing vague concerns for both contractors, such as the need to complete hardware testing and other work.\n\nNASA said Boeing\u2019s un-crewed Starliner would fly \u201cno earlier\u201d than April, with the crewed mission currently slated for August.

He has pleaded not guilty to charges of making false statements to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering.\n\nBesides probing the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow ran an operation to hack Democratic Party computers and spread disinformation to undermine candidate Hillary Clinton and the American electoral process, Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow officials.\n\nTrump denies collusion and Russia denies allegations of meddling.\n\nStone apologised to the judge for the post on Instagram and asked for a second chance.\n\n\u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow,\u201d Jackson told Stone.\n\n\u201cWhat all of this means, Mr. Stone, is that any violation of this order will be a basis for revoking your bond and detaining you pending trial. So I want to be clear - today I gave you a second chance. But this is not baseball. There will not be a third chance.\u201d\n\nJackson had ordered Stone to appear in court to review whether the posting on his Instagram account violated his conditions of release and a narrowly tailored media gag order she imposed last week. He is out on a $250,000 bond and is free to travel without court permission to certain cities.\n\nThe media gag order did not explicitly bar Stone from speaking publicly about the case as long as he was not on courthouse grounds.\n\nRoger Stone, former political adviser of U.S. President Donald Trump, departs after a hearing where Stone said he had \"abused\" a gag order with an Instagram post that appeared to threaten U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over his criminal trial, at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nHowever, it cautioned him to tread carefully and said he would not be able to complain later if he decided his own comments had tainted the jury pool.\n\nThe original posting on Monday on Stone\u2019s Instagram account not only contained a photo of Jackson next to the crosshairs, but also had text that ranted against Mueller as a \u201chitman\u201d and called Jackson \u201can Obama-appointed judge\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor in the White House.\n\nStone later took the image down and apologised, but afterwards he gave an interview on conspiracy website Infowars defending the post.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Stone said: \u201cI abused the order,\u201d Stone said. \u201cI am kicking myself over my own stupidity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour honour, I can only beseech you to give me a second chance,\u201d Stone said. \u201cForgive me the trespass. I\u2019m hurtfully sorry.\u201d\n\nThe investigation has clouded Trump\u2019s two years in office and has been a frequent target of the president and his allies. So far, the investigation has ensnared 34 people.\n\nThe most tense exchanges of Thursday\u2019s hearing were during a cross-examination by prosecutor Jonathan Kravis, who repeatedly tried to get Stone to reveal who had selected the image for him.\n\nStone testified he has between five and six volunteers who come and go freely from his home and have access to his cell phone. He rattled off the names of some volunteers, but also said he could not remember all of them.\n\nAt first when asked by his lawyer Bruce Rogow if one of those volunteers had posted the image, Stone testified he did not select or review it.\n\nLater, however, Stone said he had seen the picture and posted it himself, but did not realize its implications.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, did you not just tell me under oath less than five minutes ago that someone else posted it?\u201d Jackson asked Stone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not inconsistent - I didn\u2019t choose the image. I did post it,\u201d Stone replied.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nLater, he again changed the story, saying he had at his disposal several images of the judge to choose from before the posting.\n\n\u201cI erased all of the images of your honour because I did not want to make the same mistake twice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou had a choice?\u201d an incredulous Jackson asked. \u201cYou closed your eyes and picked?\u201d"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-dropbox-results/dropbox-expects-drop-in-first-quarter-operating-margin-shares-fall-idUKKCN1QA2RV?il=0", "text": "(Reuters) - File sharing and storage company Dropbox Inc forecast a drop in current-quarter operating margins from a year earlier, sending its shares down nearly 11 percent in extended trading.\n\nThe Dropbox app logo seen on a mobile phone in this illustration photo October 16, 2017.

Oil companies have been worried a no-deal Brexit could limit this arbitrage, creating excess supply in Europe.\n\nAccording to UK government and oil trading sources, the flow of British crude to China would not face increased tariffs under a no-deal Brexit. China has in recent months been purchasing more than South Korea, the other major Asian buyer of UK oil.\n\n\u201cLeaving without a deal wouldn\u2019t impact the tariffs we face from China,\u201d a UK government source said, since Britain already trades with China under WTO rules.\n\nThis would go some way to leaving the arbitrage in Asia open for Forties, the most popular British crude grade among Asian buyers.\n\nWith the way forward still unclear, the UK\u2019s Department for International Trade said the government recommended planning for all Brexit outcomes, including no deal.\n\n\u201cOur priority is to avoid disruption to our global trading relationships as we leave the European Union and we are seeking continuity for existing free trade agreements,\u201d the department said in a statement.\n\n\u2018FEWER OPTIONS\u2019\n\nA trader with an oil company dealing in Forties said China would remain a viable outlet under a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cYes, I think it would,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I suppose looking at the overall picture, you would have fewer options for your barrels.\u201d\n\nFlows to South Korea may decline, he said, since the UK would drop out of a free-trade agreement (FTA) the EU has with that country. With the FTA, South Korea became a big buyer of Forties, a trade that has helped support the grade\u2019s value.\n\nSuch shipments also affect global prices as Forties is part of the Brent benchmark used for oil deals. As a result, trading plays hinging on sending UK crude via tanker to the East, or appearing to do so, have become a popular feature of the market.\n\nOil companies that trade Forties are concerned its value could drop if South Korea imposes a customs tariff that matches pre-FTA levels should the UK leave the EU with no deal or without a separate trade agreement with Seoul.\n\n\u201cWe worried about the impact it would have on Forties if the obvious arbitrage was not there any more,\u201d a second North Sea trading source said. \u201cThis would lower the value as there will be too much crude in the North Sea that needs to find a home.\u201d\n\nStill, China has increasingly been providing that home, buying between 4 million and 6 million barrels of Forties a month since October, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.\n\nThe economics of the trade hinge on a number of factors, such as freight rates and the competitiveness of a Brent-linked crude such as Forties against a more local crude grade based on the Dubai benchmark.\n\n\u201cClearly the UK has found a ready market for this type of crude in China,\u201d Kpler, which researches oil trade patterns, said in a report.\n\n\u201cThe flow of Forties into China is particularly interesting given the unusually long distance and shipment time.\u201d"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-metals-copper-ahome/column-lme-copper-squeeze-will-test-markets-bull-credentials-idUKKCN1QA1RO", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Is copper finally about to break up out of its well-trodden seven-month range?\n\nCopper rods are seen at Truong Phu cable factory in northern Hai Duong province, outside Hanoi, Vietnam August 11, 2017. REUTERS/Kham\n\nLondon Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper came tantalisingly close on Wednesday with a mini-surge to $6,426.50, challenging the upper band of the $5,725 to $6,440 range that has defined the market since July 2018.\n\nThe market was regrouping Thursday around the $6,380 level.\n\nGlencore set the ball rolling with an announcement that an \u201cupdated mine plan\u201d at its Mutanda copper operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo would reduce output by 100,000 tonnes per year.\n\nMomentum came from chart dynamics, specifically a break of the 200-day moving average on Tuesday, and frantic covering by options traders against upside exposure.\n\nWhat really primed the move, however, was a dramatic tightening in LME time-spreads. The benchmark cash-to-three-months period flipped from small contango at Friday\u2019s close to $58 backwardation at Monday\u2019s close, the tightest the spread has been since October last year.\n\nThe contraction was sharp and brutal for short position-holders but not entirely unexpected.\n\nStocks of copper registered with the LME are super low. Indeed, global exchange stocks are low, which is why a growing number of copper bulls argue that copper\u2019s robust micro dynamics can turn back the bear tide of macro negativity.\n\nThe return of time-spread tightness is going to put that argument to the test.\n\nSHANGHAI STOCKS UP, U.S. STOCKS DOWN\n\nThe total amount of copper registered with the world\u2019s three exchanges \u2014 LME, Shanghai Futures Exchange and CME \u2014 rose by 60,300 tonnes in January and the first half of February.\n\nRising exchange inventory is normal at this time of the year, a seasonal low spot for manufacturing activity.\n\nNot only has this year\u2019s rise been highly modest so far, but at 411,000 tonnes total exchange inventory is 345,000 tonnes lower than it was at the same point of 2018.\n\nMoreover, just about all of the increase to date has taken place in Shanghai, where stocks are up by 88,432 tonnes since the start of January.\n\nThis too is normal, seasonal demand weakness being overlaid by the Lunar New Year holidays.\n\nThe build in Shanghai has been significantly offset by a fall in CME stocks, down by 36,143 tonnes on the start of January with metal still flying daily out the warehouse door.\n\nCME inventory, all of it located in the United States, has been dwindling steadily since May last year.\n\nSome of the metal may well have migrated to LME warehouses thanks to the massive arbitrage gap that opened up between the two exchanges last year.\n\nThat gap has just snapped shut as a previously stranded mountain of metal in CME locations such as Salt Lake City and Tucson rapidly diminishes.\n\nArbitrage may have been behind the January deliveries into LME warehouses in New Orleans but since then LME stocks in the United States have also been falling with more scheduled to depart, judging by some sizeable cancellations of metal in Chicago and New Orleans.\n\nThose cancellations have left LME \u201clive\u201d stocks at just 76,025 tonnes, not far off the decade-low of 57,650 tonnes registered at the end of October, the last occurrence of severe spread tightness.\n\nWHERE\u2019S THE METAL?\n\nExchange stocks can often flatter to deceive.\n\nThe copper market still remembers the zig-zag in LME stocks over the course of 2017, a repetitive loop of huge deliveries and equally huge departures as two trading houses slugged it out.\n\nShould we believe stocks this time?\n\nYes, according to Citi, a prominent bull in the market with a call for a 10 percent rally over the next three to six months.\n\nThe bank says it was high trucking costs that isolated much of the CME stock. With those costs since abating but U.S. physical copper premiums remaining high, metal previously stranded in Arizona and Utah has been going to consumers. (\u201cThe US Copper stock shift and CME-LME arb\u201d, Feb 19, 2019).\n\nThe lack of inflow at LME locations in the United States, just 475 tonnes so far this month, and bursts of cancellation activity in Chicago and New Orleans support such a view.\n\nBut exchange stocks are only ever the tip of a larger inventory pool.\n\nSlack LME time-spreads over the last couple of months mean that metal availability hasn\u2019t been tested.\n\nThis week\u2019s action may be about to change that.\n\nSPREADS TEST\n\nThe ferocity of the return to backwardation on the LME seems to have been in part down to one of those large-position clashes that often enliven spread trading.\n\nThe LME\u2019s positioning reports showed there were three significant longs as of the close of business Friday, each holding warrant and cash positions equivalent to 50 to 80 percent of stocks.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite as sinister as it sounds, remembering that these positions are measured against the low LME open tonnage.\n\nBut the number and size of the longs clearly spooked short-position holders. The \u201ctom-next\u201d spread, the cost of borrowing metal for one day, spiked out to a $20 backwardation on Tuesday morning.\n\nThings have calmed down a little since then. The number of dominant longs had fallen to two as of the close of business Tuesday and one of them has diminished in size.\n\n\u201cTom-next\u201d has seemingly normalised but the broader tightness hasn\u2019t dissipated. Cash metal was still $20 per tonne higher than three-month metal as of Wednesday\u2019s close.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if LME time-spreads shouldn\u2019t be tight, given that available tonnage is so low.\n\nIf anything, it was January\u2019s contango structure that looked anomalous.\n\nBorrowing the spreads may have been an enticing trade for those believing in copper\u2019s robust micro dynamics but with less conviction on the macro landscape.\n\nIf so, there may well be more collisions of multiple dominant longs and short-position holders ahead. And backwardation may be here to stay for a while.\n\nThat will test how much copper is really \u201cout there\u201d and available for exchange delivery.\n\nNot much, if bulls such as Citi are right.\n\nMaybe quite a lot, if January\u2019s relaxed spreads weren\u2019t just an anomaly.\n\nAnother dilemma for Doctor Copper.\n\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-oil-prices-kemp/column-oil-traders-bet-on-saudi-arabia-and-white-house-lifting-prices-idUKKCN1QA24T", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Oil traders are becoming very bullish on the outlook for prices, betting that Saudi Arabia will do whatever it takes to tighten the market even if consumption growth slows, helped by U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.\n\nA view shows Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq oil facility in eastern Saudi Arabia in this undated handout photo. Saudi Aramco/Handout\n\nBrent\u2019s calendar spread for the second half of 2019 has surged into a backwardation of 90 cents per barrel, the strongest for more than three months and a huge swing from a 70 cent contango near the end of last year.\n\nFor many traders, spreads rather than spot prices are a better indicator of expected balance between production and consumption (\u201cPrice relations between July and September Wheat Futures at Chicago\u201d, Working, 1933).\n\nBackwardation implies many traders expect the market to be undersupplied in the second half of the year with a significant drawdown in global inventories of crude and fuels.\n\nThe current swing to backwardation is similar to previous shifts in market structure when OPEC and its allies reduced production in 2017 and the United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran in 2018.\n\nBoth of those shifts were accelerated and amplified by significant position-building in crude oil by hedge fund managers, and something similar is likely in 2019.\n\nHedge funds and other money managers have been net buyers of Brent crude futures and options in nine of the last 10 weeks with net purchases equivalent to 130 million barrels.\n\n(Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2TZZN0D)\n\nFund managers have almost doubled their bullish position in Brent to 266 million barrels, up from just 136 million barrels in early December, according to position records published by ICE Futures Europe.\n\nPosition-building has been very similar to previous episodes, but total positions are still well below previous peaks of 500-600 million barrels, suggesting it could still have some way to run.\n\nLike other financial traders, hedge funds and other money managers tend to concentrate their positions in nearby futures contracts where there is more liquidity.\n\nHedge fund buying is therefore lifting the price of nearby contracts and accelerating the shift into backwardation (just as fund selling depressed nearby contracts and accelerated the shift to contango in the fourth quarter).\n\nTraders have become relatively bullish on oil even as they maintain a more defensive position in equities and bonds, suggesting oil prices are being lifted by idiosyncratic factors.\n\nBrent has continued to march steadily into deeper backwardation even as the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield curve has remained close to flat and major U.S. equity indices have moved sideways.\n\nTraders seem increasingly confident Saudi Arabia\u2019s output cut coupled with U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela will push the market into deficit, especially in the second half, when consumption is normally higher.\n\nThe market is expected to be undersupplied despite a slowdown in consumption growth this year and poor compliance with the production agreement by other countries in the enlarged OPEC+ group of exporters.\n\nIn effect, hedge fund managers are gambling on Saudi Arabia\u2019s determination to tighten the market and lift prices plus a relatively tough sanctions policy from the White House to counteract weakness from other sources.\n\nIf the U.S. economy slows and the Federal Reserve responds by trimming interest rates, the resulting decline in the dollar would also be supportive for oil prices, provided the slowdown is not too deep or too long.\n\nThe investment narrative is drawing strong interest from fund buyers even as investors remain more neutral in other asset classes.\n\nThe principal risks are a deeper and more prolonged slowdown in global growth; a more dovish approach to sanctions from the White House; or renewed criticism about rising prices from the U.S. president.\n\nThe White House has so far been relatively quiet about rising oil prices, but that might change if they rise above $75, the level that provoked a flurry of presidential tweets in 2018.\n\nUntil then, oil traders seem convinced the oil market will continue to tighten.\n\nJohn Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

But the building survived, unlike the courthouse next door where the families of political prisoners gathered to demand their release in February 2011, triggering the uprising that toppled Gaddafi.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had chaos and terrorism. Now we need military rule to build a state,\u201d Atluba said.\n\nThe United Nations wants to hold a national conference to prepare for elections and unite a country which sits on Africa\u2019s largest proven oil reserves and produces just under one million barrels a day.\n\nCurrently, political control in Libya is split between rival tribes, armed groups and even administrations. The east has its own government, which is opposed to a U.N.-backed authority in Tripoli.\n\nBut the scars of war in Benghazi show the difficulties of reconciling two rival camps - former soldiers and tribesmen in eastern Libya versus Islamists and urban elites in the west.\n\nPictures of a sombre Haftar, dressed in uniform, have adorned Benghazi\u2019s streets since his Libyan National Army (LNA) expelled their enemies.\n\nMany Haftar supporters see little point in reconciling with opponents, whom they call \u201cterrorists\u201d or \u201cMuslim Brothers\u201d.\n\nThat leaves limited scope for moderates who believe Libya can become a civil state without a dominant role for the military.\n\n\u201cIn Benghazi, most people would not allow you to criticise the army because they\u2019ve paid a price,\u201d said Jamal Falah, an activist, referring to Haftar\u2019s forces and the battles they fought.\n\nFalah is trying to organise a forum for Libyans from different regions to discuss a political solution that does not involve the United Nations. He wants to include people in the east who say the U.N. is biased towards Islamists.\n\nBut many LNA supporters are sceptical about dialogue. They are more encouraged by a military offensive in the south, where Haftar has challenged the government in Tripoli by taking control of the region\u2019s main city and biggest oilfield.\n\nSome say the 75-year-old general should order his troops to head for Tripoli without waiting for an election.\n\n\u201cThe army has secured the east and, thank God, with the southern offensive now also the south,\u201d said Fawzeia al-Furjani, a business leader who is from Haftar\u2019s tribe. \u201cHow can you hold elections in the west when you have militias in control?\u201d\n\nBut a push to the west by Haftar seems unlikely for now as his forces are already stretched in the south. They would in any case face resistance in Tripoli and other cities in western Libya, where many are suspicious of Haftar as a new Gaddafi.\n\nWhen asked about a possible offensive towards Tripoli, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said only: \u201cThe army (LNA) is charge of protecting the whole of Libya.\u201d He said the force supported the idea of elections but saw no chance of reconciliation with former anti-LNA fighters.\n\nSPLIT\n\nBenghazi was the first Libyan city to rise up, in February 2011, because Gaddafi had punished the east for disloyalty by essentially neglecting it during his 42 years in power.\n\nPeople walk past buildings destroyed by the war, near the old popular market known as the Souk al-Jureid, in Benghazi, Libya February 21, 2019. REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-Fetori\n\nWhile Tripoli saw two years of relative stability once Gaddafi was killed, things went downhill within months in Benghazi as rival camps began to fight.\n\nBy 2012, much of the city had poor security with al Qaeda flags at some checkpoints. The U.S ambassador was killed by Islamist militants.\n\nHaftar assembled his old army comrades and declared war on the Islamists, a conflict he won only in November 2017.\n\nSince then, life in Benghazi has improved. Critics say Haftar has resurrected the old police state and his supporters have seized the property of opponents who fled to western Libya, charges denied by officials. But residents enjoy late-night shopping, theatres have reopened, and fuel shortages are a thing of the past.\n\nBenghazi is however divided over how much power should go to Haftar.\n\nHis supporters refer to him as \u201cmushir\u201d, or field marshal, a title granted by the eastern parliament. He is seen as a candidate for eventual presidential elections.\n\n\u201cI can only see Khalifa Haftar as president. He has built the state,\u201d said Atluba, the cafe owner.\n\nBut some activists who welcomed Haftar\u2019s military victory now want a civilian leader. They are careful to express support for the \u201cjeish\u201d (army), as the LNA is called, rather than for him.\n\n\u201cI am not ready to give up a civil state,\u201d said a lawyer who gave his name as Essam. \u201cFor this we need an army like in any state. But it won\u2019t have a political role.\u201d\n\nTHEATRICAL PERFORMANCE\n\nResidents meanwhile are testing the limits of how far they can go.\n\nAt one theatre, actors tackled corruption and the decline of state services by playing Libyans who need to go to Tunisia for medical treatment but can\u2019t get tickets as officials have bribed airport staff to board overbooked flights.\n\nThey steered clear of the military, but took a swipe at conservatives who have been backing the LNA.\n\nWhen one Libyan, having finally arrived in more liberal Tunis, is chided by a fellow countryman for drinking beer, he retorts to a roar of approval from the audience: \u201cIn Tunisia, you don\u2019t need security approval to have a drink.\u201d\n\nHaftar benefits from historic divisions between east and west - separate regions before Libya\u2019s independence in 1951 - which have sharpened in recent years.\n\nHis forces depend on tribal alliances in eastern Libya. They have put out feelers to the west, where some have voiced support for Haftar, but their power base is in the east.\n\nThe LNA has also attracted supporters of a \u201cfederalist\u201d movement, campaigning since 2011 for more power for the east, which sits on much of Libya\u2019s oil.\n\nThe war\u2019s destruction has created a sense of neglect in Benghazi as there is no money to rebuild. At least 10,000 apartments and other sites such as the port and university campus were damaged or destroyed, officials say.\n\nThe Tripoli-based central bank had almost $75 billion in foreign reserves but sends little cash to the eastern government, working only with the internationally recognised administration in Tripoli.\n\nMany Benghazi residents have lost patience with politicians and look to the military to get things done.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\n\u201cI refurbished my shop, which had been heavily damaged, without any help from the government,\u201d said Anis Tajouri, who had just reopened a one-room store selling wedding dresses in Benghazi\u2019s old market, formerly a combat zone.\n\nHe called for a strong national leader: \u201cThe democracy we\u2019ve had since 2011 hasn\u2019t worked out.

But oil industry environmental regulator ASEA in January ruled that the contractor that deforested the land did not have the correct permits to do so. The body levied a fine of about $700,000. ASEA says work on the refinery can only go ahead once a full environmental impact assessment is done and approved. That could delay the refinery project for months or even years, just as the government is trying to boost oil output by giving the state a bigger role in the industry, modernizing refineries and building the new one in Tabasco, Lopez Obrador's home state.

Staley pointed to the investment bank\u2019s return on tangible equity \u2014 a key measure of profitability \u2014 rising from 2 percent to 7 percent in 2018, close to the overall target of 9 percent for the group in 2019.\n\nThe bank\u2019s fixed income, currencies and commodities trading business weathered the volatile markets of the fourth quarter better than its Wall Street rivals with revenue down 6 percent compared with double digit falls at Goldman Sachs, Citi and JPMorgan.\n\nStaley rebutted the accusation made by Bramson in a letter to his investors in December that Barclays has bought that improved performance at the expense of long-term profitability, by offering uncompetitive pricing to customers.\n\n\u201cIf you have portfolio managers and traders at Blackrock and Brevan Howard making decisions to direct a trade to our trading desks that then generates revenue for the bank, we are not buying that business,\u201d he said.\n\nStaley said that he has still not formally heard Bramson\u2019s proposals but will do so when the pair meet in New York next month.\n\nBarclays Chairman John McFarlane recommended investors vote against electing Bramson to the bank\u2019s board in the lender\u2019s annual report.\n\nBREXIT PROVISION\n\nProfits fell 3 percent in the Barclays UK division on the Brexit provision as well as flat interest margins from lending that Barclays said could fall yet further in 2019.\n\nThe bank also saw a 20 percent decrease in corporate lending income, which it attributed to resources being deployed to higher-returning business elsewhere.\n\nThat offered ammunition to critics of the investment banking-led strategy, who argue against funnelling resources to a unit that still earns half of the bank\u2019s more profitable consumer and cards business.\n\n\u201cAs a seller of Barclays, one\u2019s principal concern is always that the results will be so bad that management is forced to revisit a strategy that is hardwired to destroy shareholder value,\u201d analyst Edward Firth at broker KBW said.\n\nBarclays\u2019 \u00a3150 million Brexit provision followed similar moves by HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland in recent days.\n\nBarclays said the provision reflected the lesser of two downside economic scenarios, in which growth would slow to 0.3 percent and the country\u2019s unemployment rise to 5.7 percent.\n\nFILE PHOTO - The logo of Barclays bank is seen at its office in the Canary Wharf business district of London April 1, 2013.

That was the first negative reading since May 2016.\n\nA reading below zero indicates contraction in the region\u2019s manufacturing sector. However, manufacturers in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware remained generally upbeat about business conditions over the next six months.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment has been slowing since the second quarter of 2018, despite the White House\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut. Some companies including Apple used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale. A survey last month showed lower taxes had not caused companies to change hiring or investment plans.\n\nThere was more bad news from the housing market, which has lagged other sectors. In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales dropped 1.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.94 million units last month, the lowest level since November 2015.\n\nBut prospects for the housing market are improving, with mortgage rates declining to a one-year low and house price inflation slowing, which could make home buying more appealing. For now, the weak housing market is more evidence that the economy struggled early in 2019 after hitting a soft patch in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cBut the bigger picture is that a slowing economy, as well as the continued problem of a lack of inventory, will keep a lid on sales growth this year,\u201d said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.\n\nA fourth report from the Conference Board showed a measure of future U.S. economic activity slipped in January after being unchanged in December amid predictions of a considerable deceleration in growth by the end of 2019.\n\nJPMorgan trimmed its GDP growth estimate for the fourth quarter of 2018 by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.4 percent rate. The government will publish the fourth-quarter GDP report next Thursday. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.\n\nThe economy\u2019s outlook has been clouded by fears of a sharp slowdown in global growth, especially in China and Europe, fading fiscal stimulus, trade tensions as well as uncertainty regarding Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union.\n\nDespite the darkening clouds, the labor market remains strong, though the trend in layoffs has been indicating some weakness. In a fifth report on Thursday, the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended Feb. 16.\n\nBut the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,000 to 235,750 last week, the highest level since January 2018.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the labor market has cooled lately, and this is not too surprising given that job growth has been robust in recent months despite other signs that the economy has slowed,\u201d said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/eus-juncker-not-very-optimistic-about-brexit-deal-idUKKCN1QA17J", "text": "European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker meets with British Prime Minister Theresa May at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium February 20, 2019.

Goldman said it expected an average Brent price of $60-$65 per barrel in 2019 and 2020.\n\n(For a graphic on U.S. oil production, click here tmsnrt.rs/2VecTrj)\n\n(For a graphic on U.S. commercial crude oil inventories, click here tmsnrt.rs/2TXJSjb)\n\nMoney managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Feb. 5, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://in.reuters.com/article/russia-putin/putin-to-u-s-im-ready-for-another-cuban-missile-style-crisis-if-you-want-one-idINKCN1QA1B6?il=0", "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia is militarily ready for a Cuban Missile-style crisis if the United States wanted one and threatened to place hypersonic nuclear missiles on ships or submarines near U.S. territorial waters.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis erupted in 1962 when Moscow responded to a U.S. missile deployment in Turkey by sending ballistic missiles to Cuba, sparking a standoff that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nMore than five decades on, tensions are rising again over Russian fears that the United States might deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe, as a landmark Cold War-era arms-control treaty unravels.\n\nPutin\u2019s comments, made to Russian media late on Wednesday, follow his warning that Moscow will match any U.S. move to deploy new missiles closer to Russia by stationing its own missiles closer to the United States or by deploying faster missiles or both.\n\nPutin detailed his warning for the first time, saying Russia could deploy hypersonic missiles on ships and submarines which could lurk outside U.S. territorial waters if Washington now moved to deploy intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe.\n\n\u201c(We\u2019re talking about) naval delivery vehicles: submarines or surface ships. And we can put them, given the speed and range (of our missiles)... in neutral waters. Plus they are not stationary, they move and they will have to find them,\u201d Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript.\n\n\u201cYou work it out: Mach nine (the speed of the missiles) and over 1,000 km (their range).\u201d\n\nTREATY VIOLATIONS\n\nThe State Department dismissed Putin\u2019s earlier warning as propaganda, saying it was designed to divert attention from what Washington alleges are Moscow\u2019s violations of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.\n\nIt referred queries about Putin\u2019s latest remarks to the Pentagon, which did not immediately respond.\n\nThe INF pact bans Russia and the United States from stationing short- and intermediate-range land-based missiles in Europe. Washington announced on Feb. 1 it will withdraw from the treaty in six months unless Moscow ends its alleged violations.\n\nAnalyst Kingston Reif of the Arms Control Association think tank said Putin may be seeking to signal that Russia can keep up with the United States, to distract from its internal problems or to deflect blame for the parlous state of the INF treaty.\n\n\u201cHe may also be trying to send the message that, look, neither side should want this world (of a new arms race) so we should sit down and resume discussions,\u201d Reif said.\n\nPutin has said he does not want an arms race but would have no choice but to act if Washington deployed new missiles in Europe, some of which he says could strike Moscow within 10 to 12 minutes.\n\nThe United States does not currently have ground-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles that it could place in Europe but could develop and deploy them if the INF treaty collapses.\n\nPutin said his naval response to such a move would mean Russia could strike the United States faster than U.S. missiles deployed in Europe could hit Moscow because the flight time would be shorter.\n\n\u201cIt (the calculation) would not be in their favour, at least as things stand today. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d said Putin.\n\nRelations between Moscow and Washington were strained, he added, but the tensions were not comparable to those of the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin addresses the Federal Assembly, including the State Duma parliamentarians, members of the Federation Council, regional governors and other high-ranking officials, in Moscow, Russia February 20, 2019.

In any case that\u2019s not what we want,\u201d said Putin. \u201cIf someone wants that, well OK they are welcome. I have set out today what that would mean. Let them count (the missile flight times).\u201d\n\nSeparately, Washington said on Thursday that it was carrying out an observation flight over Russia under the Open Skies Treaty, the first one since 2017.\n\nIn a statement, the Pentagon said an unarmed OC-135B aircraft was being used and Russia was aware of the flight."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://in.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-inflation/japans-consumer-inflation-ticks-up-but-still-distant-from-bojs-goal-idINKCN1QA30A?il=0", "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s annual core consumer inflation accelerated slightly in January but remained distant from the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target, reinforcing market expectations the country is nowhere near an exit from ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nFILE PHOTO - Shoppers browse products at Japanese discount retailer Don Quijote Holdings' store in Tokyo, Japan, June 18, 2018.

Since 2016, his administration has purchased 17 tonnes of the metal worth around $650 million from so-called artisan miners, according to the most recent data from the nation\u2019s central bank.\n\nPaid with the country\u2019s near-worthless bank notes, these amateurs in turn supply the government with hard currency to purchase badly needed imports of food and hygiene products. This gold trade is a blip on international markets. Still, the United States is using sanctions and intimidation in an effort to stop Maduro from using his nation\u2019s gold to stay afloat.\n\nThe Trump administration is pressuring the United Kingdom not to release $1.2 billion in gold reserves Venezuela has stored in the Bank of England. U.S. officials recently castigated an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm for its Venezuela gold purchases, and have warned other potential foreign buyers to back off.\n\nThe existence of Maduro\u2019s gold program is well-known. How it functions is not.\n\nTo get a glimpse inside, Reuters tracked Venezuela\u2019s gold from steamy jungle mines, through the central bank in the capital of Caracas to gold refineries and food exporters abroad, speaking with more than 30 people with knowledge of the trade. They included miners, intermediaries, merchants, academic researchers, diplomats and government officials. Almost all requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, or because they feared retribution from Venezuelan or U.S. authorities.\n\nWhat emerges is the portrait of a desperate experiment in laissez-faire industrial policy by Venezuela\u2019s socialist leaders. U.S. sanctions have hammered the nation\u2019s oil industry and crippled its ability to borrow. The formal mining sector has been decimated by nationalization. So Maduro has unleashed freelance prospectors to extract the nation\u2019s mineral wealth with virtually no regulation or state investment.\n\nThe Bolivarian Revolution now leans heavily on ragtag laborers such as Jose Aular, a teenager who says he has contracted malaria five times at a wildcat mine near Venezuela\u2019s border with Brazil. Aular works 12 hours daily lugging sacks of earth to a small mill that uses toxic mercury to extract flecks of precious metal. Mining accidents are common in these ramshackle operations, workers said. So are shootings and robberies.\n\n\u201cThe government knows what happens in these mines and it benefits from it,\u201d said Aular, 18. \u201cOur gold goes into their hands.\u201d\n\nMaduro has also received a crucial assist from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a fellow strongman who has likewise sparred with the Trump administration.\n\nVenezuela exports part of its gold to Turkey, then uses some of the proceeds to buy that nation\u2019s consumer goods, according to opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni. Turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in Maduro\u2019s subsidized food program. Trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year.\n\nBut scrutiny is intensifying as Venezuela\u2019s politics reach the boiling point. In recent days, many Western countries have recognized Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American nation\u2019s rightful president.\n\nMaduro\u2019s adversaries have called on foreign buyers of Venezuela\u2019s precious metal to stop doing business with what they say is an illegitimate regime.\n\n\u201cWe are going to protect our gold,\u201d opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni told Reuters in an interview.\n\nGOLD FEVER\n\nThe gold road begins in places like La Culebra, an isolated jungle area in southern Venezuela. Here, hundreds of men labor in crude mining operations that would be at home in the 19th century. They excavate mineral-laden dirt with picks in hand-dug tunnels, hauling it out with pulleys and winches.\n\nTheir activity is laying waste to fragile forest ecosystems and spreading mosquito-borne diseases. Miners complain of shakedowns by military forces sent to guard the region, whose homicide rate is seven times the national average. Venezuela\u2019s ministries of defense and information did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMiner Jose Rondon is used to hardship. Now 47, he arrived in 2016 from northeast Venezuela with his two adult sons. His bus driver\u2019s salary could not keep pace with Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation, which the International Monetary Fund projects will hit 10 million percent this year.\n\nThe three men net roughly 10 grams of gold monthly from backbreaking work. Still it is roughly 20 times what they could earn back home.\n\n\u201cHere I do much better,\u201d said Rondon, resting in a crude bunkhouse strung with hammocks.\n\nGold in hand, miners head to the town of El Callao to sell their nuggets. Most buyers are unlicensed, small-scale traders working in cramped shops fitted with alarms and steel doors.\n\n\u201cThe state is buying gold, everyone is buying gold, because it\u2019s what is doing well,\u201d said Jhony Diaz, a licensed wholesaler in Puerto Ordaz, 171 kilometers (106 miles) north of El Callao. Diaz says he buys gold from traders and resells every three days to the central bank.\n\nBecause Venezuela\u2019s currency, the bolivar, is worth less every hour someone holds it, the state pays a premium over international prices to make it worthwhile for those who could smuggle gold out of the country to exchange for dollars.\n\nTraders who sell to Diaz end up with bricks of cash to carry back to El Callao and other gold-rush towns to pay miners, who use it to buy food, supplies and send whatever is left to their families.\n\nGold purchased by the government is smelted in the nearby furnaces of Minerven, the state-run mining company, according to a high-ranking employee. It is then transported to the vaults of the central bank in the capital Caracas, 843 kilometers (524 miles) away.\n\nThe gold does not stay there long. The central bank\u2019s gold reserves have plummeted to their lowest levels in 75 years as it sells the gold to pay its bills. One of the main buyers of this gold is Turkey, Paparoni said.\n\nTURKISH ALLIANCE\n\nMaduro\u2019s gold program has developed in tandem with his deepening relationship with Turkey\u2019s Erdogan. Both leaders have been criticized internationally for cracking down on political dissent and undermining democratic norms to concentrate power.\n\nA Nov. 1 executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump bars U.S. persons and entities from buying gold from Venezuela. It does not apply to foreigners. Ankara has assured the U.S. Treasury that all of Turkey\u2019s trade with Venezuela is in accordance with international law.\n\nVenezuela in December 2016 announced a direct flight from Caracas to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. The development was surprising given low demand for travel between the two nations.\n\nTrade data show those planes are carrying more than passengers. On New Year\u2019s Day, 2018, Venezuela\u2019s central bank began shipping gold to Turkey with a $36 million air shipment of the metal to Istanbul. It came just weeks after a visit by Maduro to Turkey.\n\nShipments last year reached $900 million, according to Turkish government data and trade reports.\n\nSocialist Party leader Tareck El Aissami during a visit to Turkey in January said Venezuela was boosting gold sales to Turkey while seeking to increase the supply of Turkish food products to Venezuela, state-owned Turkish Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nTurkish consumer products, meanwhile, are making their way to Venezuelan tables. In early December, 54 containers of Turkish powdered milk arrived at the port of La Guaira near Caracas, according to port records seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Istanbul-based shipper, Mulberry Proje Yatirim, shares an address with Marilyns Proje Yatirim, a mining company that signed a joint venture with Venezuela\u2019s state mining firm Minerven last year, according to filings with a Turkish trade registry gazette in September.\n\nThe companies did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nEven Maduro\u2019s critics acknowledge he has pulled off a neat trick of alchemy: By compensating hard-pressed citizen miners with inflation-ravaged bolivars and obtaining precious metal in return, he has found a way to spin straw into gold.\n\nVenezuelan economist Angel Alvarado, an opposition lawmaker, said \u201cdark operations and unusual mechanisms of commercial exchange,\u201d are among the few tools Maduro has left.\n\n\u201cThere is a desperation to stay in power at all costs,\u201d Alvarado said."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://in.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-gold-insight/how-venezuela-turns-its-useless-bank-notes-into-gold-idINKCN1PZ0BX?il=0", "text": "(This February 12 story corrects to remove reference to Istanbul Gold Refinery (IGR))\n\nArtisanal miners work at a wildcat gold mine in El Callao, Venezuela August 8, 2018.

Both leaders have been criticized internationally for cracking down on political dissent and undermining democratic norms to concentrate power.\n\nA Nov. 1 executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump bars U.S. persons and entities from buying gold from Venezuela. It does not apply to foreigners. Ankara has assured the U.S. Treasury that all of Turkey\u2019s trade with Venezuela is in accordance with international law.\n\nVenezuela in December 2016 announced a direct flight from Caracas to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. The development was surprising given low demand for travel between the two nations.\n\nTrade data show those planes are carrying more than passengers. On New Year\u2019s Day, 2018, Venezuela\u2019s central bank began shipping gold to Turkey with a $36 million air shipment of the metal to Istanbul. It came just weeks after a visit by Maduro to Turkey.\n\nShipments last year reached $900 million, according to Turkish government data and trade reports.\n\nSocialist Party leader Tareck El Aissami during a visit to Turkey in January said Venezuela was boosting gold sales to Turkey while seeking to increase the supply of Turkish food products to Venezuela, state-owned Turkish Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nTurkish consumer products, meanwhile, are making their way to Venezuelan tables. In early December, 54 containers of Turkish powdered milk arrived at the port of La Guaira near Caracas, according to port records seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Istanbul-based shipper, Mulberry Proje Yatirim, shares an address with Marilyns Proje Yatirim, a mining company that signed a joint venture with Venezuela\u2019s state mining firm Minerven last year, according to filings with a Turkish trade registry gazette in September.\n\nThe companies did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nEven Maduro\u2019s critics acknowledge he has pulled off a neat trick of alchemy: By compensating hard-pressed citizen miners with inflation-ravaged bolivars and obtaining precious metal in return, he has found a way to spin straw into gold.\n\nVenezuelan economist Angel Alvarado, an opposition lawmaker, said \u201cdark operations and unusual mechanisms of commercial exchange,\u201d are among the few tools Maduro has left.\n\n\u201cThere is a desperation to stay in power at all costs,\u201d Alvarado said."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://in.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics/venezuelas-maduro-starts-shutting-borders-to-block-humanitarian-aid-idINKCN1QA1XF?il=0", "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro threatened to close the border with Colombia on Thursday as opposition leader Juan Guaido and some 80 lawmakers ran a gauntlet of roadblocks trying to get to the frontier to receive humanitarian aid.\n\nGuaido, who is recognised by dozens of countries as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate head of state, was poised for a showdown with Maduro\u2019s government on Saturday, when the opposition will attempt to bring in food and medicine being stockpiled in neighbouring countries.\n\nMaduro denies there is a humanitarian crisis and said on Thursday he was considering closing Venezuela\u2019s key border with Colombia and would close the country\u2019s other main border with Brazil, effectively shutting off any legal land access.\n\nThe government has said soldiers will be stationed at official crossing points to repel any \u201cterritorial violations\u201d, although the opposition could attempt to cross anywhere along Venezuela\u2019s porous borders.\n\n\u201cI charge (Colombian President) Ivan Duque with any violence that might occur on the border,\u201d Maduro said in televised comments, surrounded by the military high command.\n\nVenezuela has already closed its maritime border with the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire, after Curacao\u2019s government said it would help store aid.\n\nOpposition lawmakers set off from Caracas in a convoy of buses just after 10 a.m. on a 800-km (500-mile) road trip to the border with Colombia. Crowds formed alongside a main highway out of the capital, waving Venezuelan flags and whooping in support.\n\nA roadblock at a tunnel some 100 km (60 miles) along the main road forced several buses to stop, Reuters witnesses and lawmakers said.

Opposition figures have suggested forming human chains across the land borders to pass packages from person to person and fleets of boats arriving from the Dutch Caribbean islands.\n\nWILL MILITARY TURN?\n\nThe opposition says it is rallying relief efforts in Venezuela to alleviate widespread food and medicine shortages in the wake of its hyperinflationary economic collapse. The oil-rich economy has halved in size in five years.\n\nTons of aid sent by the U.S. and Colombian governments is sitting in warehouses on the Colombian side of the border. Guaido tweeted late on Thursday that Chile was also airlifting supplies there, while Brazil\u2019s government said it was sending aid to its own border.\n\nMeanwhile a boat carrying 250 tons of aid left Puerto Rico\u2019s capital of San Juan headed for Venezuela on Wednesday, the local government said in a statement.\n\nMaduro accuses the Trump administration, which has levied crippling sanctions against his government, of seeking to force his ouster.\n\nThe U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, will lead a government delegation accompanying the delivery of aid from Florida to Cucuta via military aircraft between Thursday and Friday, the Department of State said.\n\nMeanwhile, the office of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said he would fly to the Colombian capital, Bogota, on Monday to discuss the crisis with leaders of the regional Lima Group of nations.\n\nGuaido invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency on Jan. 23 and denounces Maduro as an usurper. Maduro still retains the support of powerful nations like Russia and China, as well as the key backing of the military.\n\nSome political analysts say Saturday\u2019s border showdown is less about resolving Venezuela\u2019s needs and more about testing the military\u2019s loyalty by daring it to turn aid away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of this calculus that sees the military as leading a transition in Venezuela,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a thinktank.\n\nGuaido has offered amnesty to military officers who disavow Maduro, though few have so far done so.\n\nFormer military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal, who Washington accused of involvement in the drug trade a decade ago, released a social media video on Thursday offering his support for Guaido. Carvajal distanced himself from Maduro in 2017 by opposing the creation of an all-powerful legislature.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that Venezuela will soon return to democracy ...

(Reuters) - A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Florida on Thursday night carrying Israel\u2019s first lunar lander on a mission that if successful will make the Jewish state only the fourth nation to achieve a controlled touchdown on the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nThe unmanned robotic lander dubbed Beresheet - Hebrew for the biblical phrase \u201cin the beginning\u201d - soared into space from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at about 8:45 p.m. EST (0145 GMT Friday) atop the 23-story-tall rocket.\n\nBeresheet, about the size of a dish-washing machine, was one of three sets of cargo carried aloft by the Falcon 9, part of the private rocket fleet of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s California-based company SpaceX.\n\nThe rocket\u2019s two other payloads were a telecommunications satellite for Indonesia and an experimental satellite for the U.S. Air Force.\n\nBeresheet was jettisoned into Earth orbit about 34 minutes after launch, followed 15 minutes later by the release of the two satellites, according to a SpaceX webcast of the event.\n\nIn addition to a textbook launch and payload deployments, SpaceX scored yet another success in its pioneering technology for recycling its own rockets.\n\nJust minutes after blastoff, the Falcon 9\u2019s nine-engine suborbital main-stage booster separated from the upper stage, flew back to Earth and landed safely on a drone ship floating in the Atlantic Ocean more than 300 miles (483 km) off the Florida coast.\n\nAs seen from the launch site, the distant glow of the returning booster rocket was visible in the sky just as the moon appeared over the horizon.

China made history in January with its Chang\u2019e 4, the first to touch down on the dark side of the moon.\n\nBeresheet would mark the first non-government lunar landing.

On Monday, Singapore\u2019s biggest lender, DBS Group Holdings Ltd, posted an 8 percent profit increase.\n\nOCBC\u2019s share price fell 1.9 percent after the results while the broader benchmark index lost 0.4 percent. UOB was also down 1.8 percent, but DBS was up 0.6 percent.\n\n\u201cWe expect Singapore\u2019s commercial banking sector to face a more challenging operating environment in 2019, which will put further downside pressure on loan growth,\u201d Fitch Solutions said in a report last month, citing a slowing Singaporean economy.\n\nFor all of 2018, Singapore\u2019s biggest three banks reported record full-year earnings, supported by improved net interest margins and higher interest rates. Net profit rose 11 percent at OCBC, 18 percent at UOB and 28 percent at DBS.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, global economic growth is expected to slow on concerns of continued trade and geopolitical tensions, subdued market and investment sentiments and rising policy risks in the advanced economies,\u201d OCBC Chief Executive Samuel Tsien said in a statement.\n\n($1 = 1.3535 Singapore dollars)"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://in.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-japan/japans-aso-trump-has-never-mentioned-fx-when-talking-about-japan-trade-idINKCN1QB01E?il=0", "text": "Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso attends the G20 Finance and Central Bank Deputies Meeting in Tokyo, Japan January 17, 2019.

He led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes out of 282,717 ballots cast on Nov. 6, but elections officials refused to certify him the winner because of allegations of irregularities in the vote.\n\nThe pastor capitulated after his son testified he had warned his father of potential illegal activity by Republican political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless.\n\nNorth Carolina law requires that a new primary nominating election also be conducted in the district, which covers parts of Charlotte and the southeast of the state. Republicans have held the seat since 1963.\n\n\u2018ILLEGAL SCHEME\u2019\n\nIt is unclear whether Harris, 52, will run again.

Bitcoin\u2019s price has fallen more 80 percent since then, and trading volumes have slumped.\n\nSome exchanges may also feel pressure from investors seeking a means of realizing their profits.\n\n\u201cWith the market turning south and regulators not being happy, this is an opportunity to satisfy investors and founders who are looking for an exit,\u201d said Zennon Kapron, director at financial technology consultancy Kapronasia.\n\nWRESTLING WITH REGULATORS\n\nPublic listings of cryptocurrency exchanges also pose a challenge for regulators, who are only beginning to grapple with the issues of overseeing the trading of digital currencies.\n\nJapan\u2019s FSA became the first major jurisdiction to regulate the exchanges in 2016, but has since refined its rules to allow the industry to largely self-regulate.\n\nIn the United States, New York state has, so far, issued a handful of so-called BitLicences for companies doing any sort of virtual currency business.\n\nBoth Hong Kong\u2019s market watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, and the Hong Kong Exchange declined to comment.\n\nBut the commission is considering whether some cryptocurrency trading platforms are suitable for regulation, a process it hopes to finish this year, its chief executive, Ashley Alder, told legislators on Tuesday.\n\nHong Kong officials have already questioned the sustainability of crypto businesses when last year, the world\u2019s largest makers of cryptocurrency mining rigs did not follow through on IPO plans in Hong Kong, in part because of the questions officials raised.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible a crypto exchange could incubate a new crypto business inside a Hong Kong-listed company, maintain the listed company\u2019s existing operations, and not be treated as a new IPO, but it is a very difficult tightrope to walk,\u201d said a person familiar with the listing committee\u2019s processes, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to speak to the media on the subject.\n\nThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange\u2019s Listing Committee must be satisfied that a company\u2019s business is sustainable before it can list. The miners\u2019 bids were stymied by fears that the falling price of bitcoin made their business models unworkable, sources said.\n\nAlthough backdoor listings are permitted in most countries, some regulators, including those in Hong Kong, can review the deals and can in some circumstances require a full IPO instead.\n\n\u201cCrypto companies may struggle to demonstrate suitability for listing given the state of regulation of the industry and uncertain business models,\u201d said Jason Sung, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.\n\nRepresentations of the Ripple, Bitcoin, Etherum and Litecoin virtual currencies are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration picture, February 13, 2018.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been accused by critics of equivocation and a lack of clear direction.\n\n\u201cIf Brexit was a pained clarion call for change, then we hear it,\u201d said Heidi Allen, another of the former Conservative lawmakers.\n\n\u201cOur parties have been unable to grasp the magnitude of the challenge and have no plan to respond, nor heal the division across our cities, our villages and our dining tables.\u201d\n\nThe party discipline that typically prevails and helps the government set policy has broken down. Positions are entrenched, rebellions are commonplace, and the government has become accustomed to losing votes. Policymaking on all fronts has ground to a halt.\n\nTherein lies both the difficulty and the opportunity for the new group.\n\nThe now-independent lawmakers were already voting against the government, so their resignation has not changed the arithmetic in a parliament which won\u2019t approve May\u2019s Brexit deal, but can\u2019t agree on what alternative path it wants to pursue.\n\nThe group knows it can only capitalise on widespread frustration over this stalemate and fears over the ticking Brexit clock if they succeed in convincing others there is a viable alternative to the two positions offered by Labour and the Conservatives.\n\n\u201cWe have taken the first step in leaving the old tribal politics behind and we invite others who share our political values to do so too,\u201d said former Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna, who resigned on Monday.\n\nSECOND REFERENDUM\n\nThe lawmakers have not yet formed a new party with an agreed set of policies and positions on key issues. But their future will almost certainly be defined by Brexit, and they do not have much time to make an impact.\n\nAlmost all the group\u2019s members are clear that they do not want Britain to leave the EU without a deal, and they do want to hold a second referendum.\n\nOne or both of those views are shared by many in parliament, including ministers who have so far remained loyal to May and voted in favour of her deal despite their reservations.\n\nBut even in government, patience is wearing thin.\n\nOne minister who declined to be named, told Reuters prior to the defections that he was ready to vote against the government and face the sack if May hadn\u2019t made any progress on a deal. Several other have signalled publicly they could do the same.\n\nTheir loyalty is set to be tested next week when May either returns to parliament with a revised Brexit deal, or to set out what progress she has made towards one.

Toyota builds just one model in Britain, the Corolla, but has only just started making it - in an industry where vehicles tend to have a seven-year production life cycle.\n\nRACKS OF DASHBOARDS\n\nAston Martin and Vauxhall are as different as two auto companies can be. Now Brexit has thrown Palmer and Norman into the same precarious boat as, like their rivals, they seek to minimise the potential harm of a disorderly British exit.\n\nThe two companies have significant British manufacturing operations and together have thousands of employees in the country. Palmer and Norman both said in interviews that the impact of Brexit would be more complicated, more pervasive and take longer to play out than policymakers and the public appreciated.\n\nFor Aston Martin, which sells sports cars at prices well above 100,000 pounds, new European tariffs on British-built cars are not a significant concern, Palmer said.\n\nLike other smaller players such as Bentley, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, Aston has much larger margins on its cars and extra costs can be more easily passed onto wealthy customers. That\u2019s not a luxury enjoyed by mass-market players.\n\nWhat concerns Palmer more is the disruption to his company\u2019s network of suppliers and its meticulously scheduled production system.\n\nAs he walks through Aston\u2019s Gaydon factory, Palmer points to several rows of dashboards mounted on carriers and crowded into a corner of the plant.\n\nA man works at the Aston Martin production line at their world headquarters in Gaydon, Britain, February 14, 2019. REUTERS/Andrew Yates\n\nAston is building stockpiles of key parts in case an abrupt, no-deal Brexit results in trucks with components getting delayed by chaos at British ports. It is increasing the days of stock it holds from three days to five days and could fly in parts if ports become clogged up after March 29.\n\nAston receives many of its engines from a Mercedes-Benz factory in Germany, and new border checks and tariffs could delay those shipments.\n\nReverting to a regime of cross-border tariffs and World Trade Organization rules, after decades of free trade, would force Aston and its suppliers to trace and document where all the parts in a vehicle come from, Palmer told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got 10,000 parts on a car and then you\u2019ve got all of the sub-parts and the sub-parts, you quickly get up to hundreds of thousands of parts. And do you honestly know where they\u2019ve all come from? Often not,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason why Palmer said he hired a supply chain chief, an appointment announced last month. \u201cHis obsession right now is planning for Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Brexit vote in mid-2016 came as Aston Martin was pursuing a multi-year strategy, unveiled in 2015, to go from making about 3,500 sports cars a year to building up to 14,000 sports cars and SUVs annually.\n\nThe St Athan plant will start building DBX SUVs, and then is expected to begin assembling a new line luxury electric vehicles under the Lagonda brand early in the 2020s.\n\nScrapping that investment is not Aston\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cPeople have asked me: what keeps you awake?\u201d Palmer said. \u201cIt very much is the supply chain and the capability of that supply chain to absorb all the macroeconomics that are thrown at them.\u201d\n\nAston is not alone in this concern: Volkswagen, the biggest car seller in Britain, and Honda have both said they are stockpiling parts while Jaguar Land Rover has been talking to warehousing companies and Bentley has leased storage space.\n\nIN CHAOS, OPPORTUNITY?\n\nAt Vauxhall, boss Norman said Brexit could be an opportunity for a brand that struggled under its former owner, U.S. automaker General Motors, and is charting a new strategy under French group PSA.\n\nVauxhall believes a no-deal Brexit would lead to as much as a 20 percent fall in British new vehicle demand but a bigger market share for Vauxhall.\n\nPSA has committed last year to fresh investment to launch new models at its Luton van factory. But it faces a decision next year on whether to keep Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port plant open after the current run of Astra Sports Tourer ends.\n\nThat decision is not a simple one, Norman said.\n\n\u201cIt would not be true to say that a hard Brexit automatically means the closure of plants in the United Kingdom, neither for us, nor for other manufacturers, but it would certainly mean they come under greater scrutiny,\u201d he said.\n\nBritish workers would have to deliver productivity gains that offset tariffs and supply chain friction.\n\nCurrently Vauxhall, which was bought by Peugeot parent company PSA in 2017, accounts for 7.5 percent of British car sales.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nAdded to the group\u2019s Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands the total rises to 13 percent, making PSA one of the biggest sellers in Europe\u2019s No.2 auto market.\n\nIf the market takes a hit, Vauxhall\u2019s emphasis on functional, economically priced models could be an advantage, Norman said.\n\n\u201cPeople will look very long and hard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they will say: do I need this enhanced brand strength which I\u2019m actually paying for that has no material value or should I not look more seriously at the offer from Vauxhall ... and have just as good a vehicle and not have to pay through the nose for the privilege.\u201d"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://in.reuters.com/article/usa-afghanistan-talks/new-taliban-political-chief-to-miss-upcoming-peace-talks-with-u-s-envoys-idINKCN1QA1YB", "text": "PESHAWAR, Pakistan/KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan Taliban leaders said on Thursday that their new political chief will not be attending peace talks with U.S. envoys due to take place in Qatar next week.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Head of Political Office of the Taliban Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanakzai attends a conference arranged by the Afghan diaspora, in Moscow, Russia February 5, 2019.

But oil industry environmental regulator ASEA in January ruled that the contractor that deforested the land did not have the correct permits to do so. The body levied a fine of about $700,000. ASEA says work on the refinery can only go ahead once a full environmental impact assessment is done and approved. That could delay the refinery project for months or even years, just as the government is trying to boost oil output by giving the state a bigger role in the industry, modernizing refineries and building the new one in Tabasco, Lopez Obrador's home state. Gustavo Alanis, president of the Mexican Center of Environmental Law advocacy group, said Pemex will run into legal problems if it continues to act in haste over the planned Dos Bocas refinery.\n\nA sign in an area belonging to the state-run oil company Pemex reads in Spanish: 'Federal Property - Pemex Exploration and Production'. \"If they move quickly without paying heed to the laws they need to follow, they'll become their own worst enemy,\" he said.

Pemex did not respond to requests for comment for this article. The land, near the town of Paraiso, where the new refinery is planned was planted with coconut and citrus fruit in the 1970s and expropriated by Pemex. But the company never used the terrain and tropical woodland and wildlife took over.\n\nPelicans gather at the Mecoacan lagoon near Paraiso. Several types of plovers, herons and hawks, two species of iguanas and other reptiles, protected amphibians, threatened species of snakes and piping plovers, which are in danger of extinction, were identified in Paraiso by Conabio, a government commission in charge of studying biodiversity. Footprints of the jaguarundi, a wild cat, were found at the site, ASEA told Reuters, along with a wide variety of bird species and freshwater turtles. The land was so rich in wildlife about a decade ago that a group of Pemex executives proposed that it be declared a private nature reserve to prevent future building there, company sources said. A study by a government institute several years ago concluded Paraiso was a risky location for a refinery because of the biodiversity found there.\n\n1 / 12 Slideshow Fisherman Luis Angel Gimenez, 14, stands on his boat at the Mecoacan lagoon.

That was the first negative reading since May 2016.\n\nA reading below zero indicates contraction in the region\u2019s manufacturing sector. However, manufacturers in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware remained generally upbeat about business conditions over the next six months.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment has been slowing since the second quarter of 2018, despite the White House\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut. Some companies including Apple used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale. A survey last month showed lower taxes had not caused companies to change hiring or investment plans.\n\nThere was more bad news from the housing market, which has lagged other sectors. In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales dropped 1.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.94 million units last month, the lowest level since November 2015.\n\nBut prospects for the housing market are improving, with mortgage rates declining to a one-year low and house price inflation slowing, which could make home buying more appealing. For now, the weak housing market is more evidence that the economy struggled early in 2019 after hitting a soft patch in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cBut the bigger picture is that a slowing economy, as well as the continued problem of a lack of inventory, will keep a lid on sales growth this year,\u201d said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.\n\nA fourth report from the Conference Board showed a measure of future U.S. economic activity slipped in January after being unchanged in December amid predictions of a considerable deceleration in growth by the end of 2019.\n\nJPMorgan trimmed its GDP growth estimate for the fourth quarter of 2018 by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.4 percent rate.

Monthly building approvals are down by 40 percent from their peak and construction loans hit a three-year low in December.\n\nRIPPLE EFFECT\n\nProfits are falling, or forecast to drop at building suppliers CSR Ltd and Boral Ltd, and ancillary companies are also suffering.\n\nGarbage collector Bingo Industries Ltd on Monday reported a slowdown in building waste volume growth in the first half of its fiscal year, an announcement that halved the value of its shares.\n\n\u201cIt flows through everything,\u201d said Jason Teh, Chief Investment Officer at Vertium Asset Management.\n\nHousing price falls tend to discourage spending because home owners feel less wealthy, save more, and cut back on purchases.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether there\u2019s more to come...the economic momentum, as showed by company earnings is getting worse,\u201d Teh said, adding it would probably take a central bank rate cut to arrest the decline.\n\nProperty classifieds sites Domain Australia Holdings Ltd and News Corp-owned rival REA Group as well as furniture seller Nick Scali are also feeling the negative effects.\n\nGrocers Coles Group Ltd and Woolworths Group Ltd have also reported slowdowns.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cPeople are just not as confident or sure as to where things are going,\u201d said Darryl Abotomey, chief executive of car repairer and parts distributor Bapcor Ltd, which has cut its outlook as drivers postpone vehicle servicing.\n\nHis thoughts were echoed at Epping, where realtor Oliver Yap said an apartment nearby that fetched A$562,000 a year ago had taken months to attract a A$415,000 offer.

Security, amid an increase in Islamist attacks in the northeast, and corruption have also been campaign issues.\n\nSo far, there are no further public rallies planned by either man.

Neither party has provided evidence for this.\n\nThe electoral commission said the postponement was due solely to logistical factors and denied political pressure had played any part in the decision.\n\nThis is the third straight election to be postponed. Presidential elections in 2011 and 2015 were also delayed over logistics and security issues.\n\nNigeria will on Saturday choose between Buhari and Atiku, both in their 70s. Between them, the two candidates have run for president nine times. Almost 70 other candidates are running, though their chances are slim.\n\nWHAT\u2019S AT STAKE?\n\nBuhari\u2019s 2015 victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party was built on three promises: to rid Nigeria of corruption, fix the economy and defeat threats to security.\n\nResults have been mixed. The military\u2019s efforts to fight the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency, now in its tenth year, are crumbling.\n\nThe economy entered and climbed out of recession under Buhari, yet Nigerians are getting poorer. Opponents say his government is failing to tackle corruption, targeting only his enemies and ignoring allegations against his allies.\n\nMany have accused the former military dictator\u2019s administration of flouting the rule of law. The army has been accused of human rights abuses, including the massacre of protesters. Court orders have been ignored by the executive branch and security services have arrested journalists.\n\nAfter he spent five months in Britain in 2017 receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment, opposition groups said Buhari was unfit for office and his administration did little.\n\nIf Buhari wins, his opponents say Nigeria faces another four years of political torpor and disregard for rights.\n\nThe president\u2019s campaign has focused on rail and road development that he says would reap long-term benefits. He has also vowed to expand a vocational skills programme, improve access to credit for entrepreneurs, and fight corruption.\n\nThe alternative is Atiku, of the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), who has faced corruption allegations since serving as vice president from 1999-2007. He has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAtiku, who has ventures ranging from a port logistics firm to a private university, has said he would introduce business-friendly policies aimed at doubling the size of the economy by 2025.\n\nHis proposals include privatising parts of the state oil company and creating a $25 billion fund to support private sector infrastructure investment.\n\nAtiku\u2019s opponents say he would exploit those policies to enrich himself and those around him.\n\nFAULT LINES AND FRACTURES\n\nNigeria is deeply divided. One of the most fundamental rifts is between the mainly Muslim north and the largely Christian south, and the population is fairly evenly split between the religions. Africa\u2019s most populous country has more than 200 ethnic groups, with the three largest the Hausa in the north, the Yoruba in the southwest and the Igbo in the southeast.\n\nThat has led to an unofficial power-sharing agreement. The presidency is to alternate between north and south after every two four-year terms. Buhari, a northern Muslim, has held the post since 2015. His predecessor, the PDP\u2019s Goodluck Jonathan, is a southern Christian. In keeping with the accord, the PDP selected Atiku, a northerner, as its candidate for 2019.\n\nWith two northern Muslims leading the pack, there may be less election violence around ethnicity, religion and region. However, the south has favoured the PDP in the past, while the north is Buhari\u2019s stronghold.\n\nBut in the diverse hinterland states known as the Middle Belt, the picture is less clear. Long-running violence over diminishing arable land between farmers and nomadic herders has exploded, with a death toll of more than 3,600 since 2016, according to Amnesty International.\n\nThis could turn the Middle Belt, much of which voted for Buhari in 2015, into swing states.\n\nGENERATION GAP\n\nWith a booming young population, Nigeria\u2019s median age is just 18. Many youth see Nigeria\u2019s ageing leaders as out of touch. Buhari, 76, is the oldest person to lead Nigeria since the return to civilian government in 1999. That sparked \u201cNot Too Young to Run\u201d campaigns to allow younger people to seek office. Despite that, the PDP chose 72-year-old Atiku as their candidate.\n\nNigeria\u2019s former military leaders also retain a strong influence over politics nearly two decades after the return of civilian rule. Buhari, then a general, took power in a military coup in 1983 and ruled until 1985.\n\nTHE PARTIES\n\nThe two main parties do not have clear ideological differences. Competition for control of oil revenues, patronage and rivalries between ethnic groups have played a much bigger role in elections than ideology.\n\nHowever, Buhari\u2019s 2019 campaign has prioritised poverty alleviation and social schemes, while Atiku has stressed the need for a better business environment. Both candidates vow to improve the country\u2019s decrepit infrastructure.\n\nThe APC is the latest incarnation of the various vehicles Buhari used to run in 2003, 2007 and 2011. His eventual victory in 2015 came after assembling a broad coalition across the north and southwest.\n\nThe PDP was the inheritor of decades of military rule in 1999, and held power until Jonathan\u2019s defeat in 2015. The party has traditionally appealed to Nigeria\u2019s business community.\n\nAtiku, a long-time PDP member, joined the APC and became a key ally and funder of Buhari during the 2015 campaign. Atiku switched sides in late 2017.\n\nELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\nConcerns about election rigging are high. Buhari has said anyone trying to tamper with the vote, \u201cwill do it at the expense of his own life\u201d. The PDP said Buhari was calling for \u201cjungle justice\u201d.\n\nIn January, Buhari triggered a constitutional row when he suspended the chief judge, who has a crucial say in resolving election result disputes, over his alleged violation of wealth declaration rules.\n\nNigerian social media has become just as fraught. Rumours are flying thick and fast online despite a government campaign to tackle \u201cfake news\u201d. Responding to the problem, Facebook said it would roll out some of its political advertising rules and tools for curbing election interference to Nigeria.\n\nTURNOUT AND RUNOFFS\n\nVoter turnout in the 2015 election was 29.4 million, or 44 percent of the 67.4 million registered voters, according to Independent National Electoral Commission data. For 2019, the number of registered voters has risen to 84 million, just over half of them aged 18-35.\n\nThe candidate with the most votes is declared winner as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and the capital. Otherwise there is a run-off."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://af.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKCN1QA23N-OZABS", "text": "A Moody's sign on the 7 World Trade Center tower is photographed in New York, file.

Picture taken February 7, 2019. REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-Fetori\n\nYet like many in Benghazi, who are tired after three years of street fighting that flattened whole districts, the 45-year-old thinks it\u2019s time to return to the old way of running things.\n\n\u201cMuammar needed to go but democracy hasn\u2019t worked out in Libya,\u201d he said, sipping coffee in one of the few buildings still standing in a city centre where from 2014 to 2017 war raged between the forces of Khalifa Haftar, a general who turned against Gaddafi, and his mainly Islamist opponents.\n\nAtluba\u2019s cafe was damaged. But the building survived, unlike the courthouse next door where the families of political prisoners gathered to demand their release in February 2011, triggering the uprising that toppled Gaddafi.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had chaos and terrorism. Now we need military rule to build a state,\u201d Atluba said.\n\nThe United Nations wants to hold a national conference to prepare for elections and unite a country which sits on Africa\u2019s largest proven oil reserves and produces just under one million barrels a day.\n\nCurrently, political control in Libya is split between rival tribes, armed groups and even administrations. The east has its own government, which is opposed to a U.N.-backed authority in Tripoli.\n\nBut the scars of war in Benghazi show the difficulties of reconciling two rival camps - former soldiers and tribesmen in eastern Libya versus Islamists and urban elites in the west.\n\nPictures of a sombre Haftar, dressed in uniform, have adorned Benghazi\u2019s streets since his Libyan National Army (LNA) expelled their enemies.\n\nMany Haftar supporters see little point in reconciling with opponents, whom they call \u201cterrorists\u201d or \u201cMuslim Brothers\u201d.\n\nThat leaves limited scope for moderates who believe Libya can become a civil state without a dominant role for the military.\n\n\u201cIn Benghazi, most people would not allow you to criticize the army because they\u2019ve paid a price,\u201d said Jamal Falah, an activist, referring to Haftar\u2019s forces and the battles they fought.\n\nFalah is trying to organise a forum for Libyans from different regions to discuss a political solution that does not involve the United Nations. He wants to include people in the east who say the U.N. is biased towards Islamists.\n\nBut many LNA supporters are sceptical about dialogue. They are more encouraged by a military offensive in the south, where Haftar has challenged the government in Tripoli by taking control of the region\u2019s main city and biggest oilfield.\n\nSome say the 75-year-old general should order his troops to head for Tripoli without waiting for an election.\n\n\u201cThe army has secured the east and, thank God, with the southern offensive now also the south,\u201d said Fawzeia al-Furjani, a business leader who is from Haftar\u2019s tribe. \u201cHow can you hold elections in the west when you have militias in control?\u201d\n\nBut a push to the west by Haftar seems unlikely for now as his forces are already stretched in the south. They would in any case face resistance in Tripoli and other cities in western Libya, where many are suspicious of Haftar as a new Gaddafi.\n\nWhen asked about a possible offensive towards Tripoli, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said only: \u201cThe army (LNA) is charge of protecting the whole of Libya.\u201d He said the force supported the idea of elections but saw no chance of reconciliation with former anti-LNA fighters.\n\nSPLIT\n\nBenghazi was the first Libyan city to rise up, in February 2011, because Gaddafi had punished the east for disloyalty by essentially neglecting it during his 42 years in power.\n\nWhile Tripoli saw two years of relative stability once Gaddafi was killed, things went downhill within months in Benghazi as rival camps began to fight.\n\nBy 2012, much of the city had poor security with al Qaeda flags at some checkpoints. The U.S ambassador was killed by Islamist militants.\n\nHaftar assembled his old army comrades and declared war on the Islamists, a conflict he won only in November 2017.\n\nSince then, life in Benghazi has improved. Critics say Haftar has resurrected the old police state and his supporters have seized the property of opponents who fled to western Libya, charges denied by officials. But residents enjoy late-night shopping, theatres have reopened, and fuel shortages are a thing of the past.\n\nBenghazi is however divided over how much power should go to Haftar.\n\nHis supporters refer to him as \u201cmushir\u201d, or field marshal, a title granted by the eastern parliament. He is seen as a candidate for eventual presidential elections.\n\n\u201cI can only see Khalifa Haftar as president. He has built the state,\u201d said Atluba, the cafe owner.\n\nBut some activists who welcomed Haftar\u2019s military victory now want a civilian leader. They are careful to express support for the \u201cjeish\u201d (army), as the LNA is called, rather than for him.\n\n\u201cI am not ready to give up a civil state,\u201d said a lawyer who gave his name as Essam. \u201cFor this we need an army like in any state. But it won\u2019t have a political role.\u201d\n\nTHEATRICAL PERFORMANCE\n\nResidents meanwhile are testing the limits of how far they can go.\n\nAt one theatre, actors tackled corruption and the decline of state services by playing Libyans who need to go to Tunisia for medical treatment but can\u2019t get tickets as officials have bribed airport staff to board overbooked flights.\n\nThey steered clear of the military, but took a swipe at conservatives who have been backing the LNA.\n\nWhen one Libyan, having finally arrived in more liberal Tunis, is chided by a fellow countryman for drinking beer, he retorts to a roar of approval from the audience: \u201cIn Tunisia, you don\u2019t need security approval to have a drink.\u201d\n\nHaftar benefits from historic divisions between east and west - separate regions before Libya\u2019s independence in 1951 - which have sharpened in recent years.\n\nHis forces depend on tribal alliances in eastern Libya. They have put out feelers to the west, where some have voiced support for Haftar, but their power base is in the east.\n\nThe LNA has also attracted supporters of a \u201cfederalist\u201d movement, campaigning since 2011 for more power for the east, which sits on much of Libya\u2019s oil.\n\nThe war\u2019s destruction has created a sense of neglect in Benghazi as there is no money to rebuild. At least 10,000 apartments and other sites such as the port and university campus were damaged or destroyed, officials say.\n\nThe Tripoli-based central bank had almost $75 billion in foreign reserves but sends little cash to the eastern government, working only with the internationally recognised administration in Tripoli.\n\nMany Benghazi residents have lost patience with politicians and look to the military to get things done.\n\n\u201cI refurbished my shop, which had been heavily damaged, without any help from the government,\u201d said Anis Tajouri, who had just reopened a one-room store selling wedding dresses in Benghazi\u2019s old market, formerly a combat zone.\n\nHe called for a strong national leader: \u201cThe democracy we\u2019ve had since 2011 hasn\u2019t worked out.

The United Nations confirmed these figures as official government data provided at the end of January and said North Korea\u2019s food production included rice, wheat, potatoes and soy beans.\n\nNorth Korea said it would import 200,000 tons of food and produce about 400,000 tons of early crops, but that it would still be left with a gap and from January would cut daily rations to 300 grams (10.5 ounces) per person from 550 grams.\n\nU.N. officials and aid groups in North Korea were consulting the government to \u201cfurther understand the impact of the food security situation on the most vulnerable people in order to take early action to address their humanitarian needs,\u201d U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday.\n\nHe said the United Nations and aid groups were only able to help one third of six million people estimated to be in need last year due to a lack of funding. A U.N. appeal for $111 million in 2018 was only a quarter funded, Dujarric said.\n\nThe United Nations estimates a total of 10.3 million people - almost half the population - are in need and some 41 percent of North Koreans are undernourished, Dujarric said.\n\nBAD HARVEST\n\nAlong with extreme weather, the North Korean memo also blames U.N. sanctions for restricting the delivery of farming materials and hindering fuel supply for the agricultural sector.\n\nU.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun said earlier this month the United States had eased rules on humanitarian assistance to North Korea and was working to clear a backlog of U.N. approvals.\n\nBenjamin Silberstein, co-editor of North Korean Economy Watch and an associate scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said the harvest had been bad but there was no sign of an emergency.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s at least partially about the sanctions,\u201d Silberstein said.\n\n\u201cJust look at the way the letter is worded. They want to make it sound like sanctions equals starvation so the U.S. should really be benevolent and give them up,\u201d he said.\n\nHumanitarian aid nearly ground to a halt in 2018 as the United States stepped up enforcement of U.N. sanctions, even though the Security Council North Korea sanctions committee has said sanctions \u201care not intended to have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Security Council sanctions clearly exempt humanitarian activities, there have been unintended consequences on humanitarian operations,\u201d Dujarric said.\n\nMargareta Wahlstrom, president of the Swedish Red Cross, told Reuters after a trip to North Korea in November that, as far as the areas in which they operated were concerned, the maze harvest was only 65 percent of what should be normal due to the combination of an influenza outbreak, a heat wave and a typhoon.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A North Korean flag flutters on top of a 160-metre tower in North Korea's propaganda village of Gijungdong, in this picture taken from the Tae Sung freedom village near the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), inside the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas, in Paju, South Korea, April 24, 2018.

He rattled off the names of some volunteers, but also said he could not remember all of them.\n\nAt first when asked by his lawyer Bruce Rogow if one of those volunteers had posted the image, Stone testified he did not select or review it.\n\nLater, however, Stone said he had seen the picture and posted it himself, but did not realize its implications.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, did you not just tell me under oath less than five minutes ago that someone else posted it?\u201d Jackson asked Stone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not inconsistent - I didn\u2019t choose the image.

The U.S. Army\u2019s private landlords committed this week to providing military families greater say and safer homes, endorsing a military blueprint that aims to reduce hazards in base housing and give tenants a stronger voice when problems arise.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Some of the newer housing where mold has been found is seen at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, U.S. November 26, 2018. REUTERS/Nick Oxford/File Photo\n\nExecutives from seven real estate companies, which manage some 87,000 Army housing units at more than 40 bases, pledged a series of reforms following a Pentagon meeting earlier this week with the Army\u2019s three senior leaders \u2013 Secretary Mark Esper, Chief of Staff Mark Milley and Sergeant Major Daniel Dailey.\n\nThe landlords agreed to add staffing and become more responsive to housing concerns by setting up online tracking systems for service requests. They also endorsed a military-proposed \u201ctenant bill of rights\u201d that will allow families to withhold rent while preventing the private housing companies from charging fees when families receive poor service.\n\nThose steps, announced Thursday by the Army, signal the latest action to follow a Reuters series, Ambushed at Home, that exposed serious housing hazards at bases nationwide.\n\nIn one story, the news agency described how military families lack basic tenant protections in disputes with their landlords over vermin, mold and other hazards. Local inspectors generally lack enforcement authority on military bases, and base command staff said they had limited power to intervene under the companies\u2019 50-year contracts. For many families, withholding rent wasn\u2019t a ready option, because their monthly housing stipends go directly to the companies.\n\nRead the story, Mice, Mold and Landlords at: here\n\n\u201cThe situation is unacceptable, and we are failing our Soldiers and their families by not providing the quality housing they deserve,\u201d top Army leaders wrote in a letter last week to senior commanders at bases across the globe.\n\nOn Thursday, company officials said they have already enacted some changes and continue to work with the military branches on related reforms at their installations.\n\n\u201cWe are aligned with our Army, Navy and Air Force partners and actively working with each of them to identify opportunities to improve privatized military housing,\u201d landlord Balfour Beatty wrote to Reuters.\n\nHunt Military Communities, another major military landlord, is working \u201cto ensure we are providing the best possible housing for America\u2019s Service Members and their families,\u201d company President John Ehle said through a spokesperson.\n\n\u201cWe share the Army\u2019s commitment to making things better for soldiers and their families,\u201d echoed Jarl Bliss, President and CEO of Lincoln Military Housing, through a spokesperson.\n\nThe fine print of the landlord reform plan \u2013 such as under which circumstances residents can withhold rent, and how the provisions will be enforced \u2013 has yet to be ironed out. It\u2019s likely the Army and its private industry partners will have to renegotiate some aspects of their contracts."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nike-stocks/basketball-shoe-malfunction-puts-nike-in-the-spotlight-idUSKCN1QA1AE", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Nike Inc sneaker worn by a college basketball superstar split in half less than a minute into a highly anticipated game between Duke University and North Carolina, prompting an outcry on social media as the company sought to figure out what caused the problem.\n\nZion Williamson, a 6-foot-7-inch freshman forward for the Duke Blue Devils who is anticipated to be the top 2019 NBA Draft pick, suffered a mild sprain to his right knee because of the incident on Wednesday night, according to his coach Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nThe official Duke Basketball Twitter handle (@DukeMBB) tweeted Thursday evening that Zion was \u201cprogressing as expected, and his status is day-to-day.\u201d\n\nA closeup video replay showed Williamson slipping and crumpling to the ground, clutching his knee in pain. His left shoe is seen split in half, with part of the sole ripped off the base of the sneaker.\n\nWilliamson did not return to play in the match-up, which ended with No. 1-ranked Duke losing 72-88 to the No. 8-ranked Tar Heels team.\n\n\u201cWe are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery,\u201d Nike said in a statement. \u201cThe quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance.

Russia is now cutting its losses and selling the three ships to India without engines.\n\nThe navy\u2019s problems stem largely, but not exclusively, from the Ukrainian sanctions. There are also problems, for different reasons, with new equipment for the army and air force.\n\nThe picture that emerges is that Russia\u2019s armed forces are not as capable or modern as its annual Red Square military parades suggest and that its ability to project conventional force is more limited too.\n\n\u201cYou need to always distinguish between reality and the shop window,\u201d said Andrei Frolov, editor-in-chief of Russian magazine Arms Exports.\n\n\u201cRed Square is a shop window. It\u2019s like in restaurants in Japan where there are models of the food. What we see on Red Square are models of food, not the food itself.\u201d\n\nWestern diplomats and military experts say Putin has long projected an image of military might to strengthen his and Moscow\u2019s image at home and abroad, but that Russia is overhauling its military far more slowly than China.\n\n\u201cMoscow\u2019s problems mean its ability to project conventional military force \u2014 something it is doing in Syria and has done in Ukraine \u2014 is not as great as the Kremlin would have the world believe,\u201d said one Western official with knowledge of Russia\u2019s military.\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday, Putin did not mention the navy\u2019s engine problems, focusing instead on how it is due to receive seven new multi-purpose submarines ahead of time and 16 new surface ships by 2027.\n\nDefense spending has risen sharply under Putin. But Russian officials and military experts say Moscow has a shortage of modern factories and skilled labor and does not have the available financial resources needed to reverse decades of post-Soviet decline as quickly as it wants.\n\nFrolov said Russia had successfully produced prototypes of new weapons systems, but struggled to move to serial production.\n\nThat does not mean Russia\u2019s military is not a force with which to be reckoned. Some of its hardware, such as its S-400 air defense systems, is world-class. Putin has also spent heavily on missile technology, unveiling new hypersonic systems.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s air force and army, like its navy, are experiencing re-armament problems. Its new stealth fighter first took to the air more than nine years ago and a super tank made its Red Square debut almost four years ago. Neither is due to be deployed in large numbers soon, government officials say.\n\nNAVAL DISARRAY\n\nThe program to build Russia\u2019s most advanced stealth frigate, the Admiral Gorshkov-class, has been paralyzed by sanctions \u2014 even before the sanctions hit it took 12 years to build the lead ship, which entered service last summer.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Russian Navy's frigate Admiral Grigorovich sails in the Bosphorus on its way to the Mediterranean Sea, in Istanbul, Turkey, November 4, 2016. REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nRussia hopes to add 14 more such ships to its navy, but has no engines for 12 of those vessels.\n\nMoscow is trying to develop its own gas turbine engines and its own full-cycle manufacturing base.\n\nThat task has been handed to aircraft manufacturer NPO Saturn, which is part of Rostec, an industrial conglomerate run by Sergei Chemezov, who served as a KGB spy with Putin.\n\nIlya Fedorov, Saturn\u2019s then director, said in 2014 he had concerns about costs, and the company failed to deliver the first engines to the navy in 2017.\n\nFedorov told the Russian news agency Interfax at the time that \u201call our ships run on these turbines, and if we don\u2019t make our own everything will grind to a halt.\u201d\n\nFedorov is no longer with the company. Viktor Polyakov, Saturn\u2019s current director, said early last year that prototypes of its three new engine types had passed tests and that serial production had begun.\n\nChemezov told Reuters at a military exhibition in Abu Dhabi this month that an undisclosed number of engines had been handed to the navy. But none has yet been fitted to the frigates.\n\nSaturn says it has received initial orders from the Ministry of Defense. But one source close to the matter said the ministry had not yet guaranteed how many engines it would buy.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t expect Russia to start fully fledged serial production for at least another five years,\u201d said Serhiy Zgurets, director of Defense Express, a Ukrainian consultancy.\n\nAlexei Rakhmanov, head of Russia\u2019s United Shipbuilding Corporation, said in December that the first Russian-made engine should be fitted to the fourth of 14 more planned frigates in the \u201cvery nearest future.\u201d\n\nEven if that happens, Igor Ponomarev, the head of the St Petersburg shipyard making the new stealth frigates, says that vessel is not due to be ready before the end of 2022. The rest of the program is likely to stretch into the 2030s.\n\nTROUBLED STEALTH FIGHTER AND TANK\n\nRussia\u2019s planned new Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter jet is also experiencing problems.\n\nMoscow had initially been expected to procure about 150 of the fifth-generation Su-57s, but defense industry and government officials say they now expect just one plane, the first serially-produced aircraft, this year. A further 14 may follow.\n\nExperts say the costs of mass-producing the new plane are simply beyond Russia.\n\nPlans for Russia\u2019s super tank have also foundered.\n\nOleg Sienko, the then director of the factory which produces the new T-14 Armata battle tank, said in 2016 Putin had approved the purchase of 2,300 Armatas.

Washington announced on Feb. 1 it will withdraw from the treaty in six months unless Moscow ends its alleged violations.\n\nAnalyst Kingston Reif of the Arms Control Association think tank said Putin may be seeking to signal that Russia can keep up with the United States, to distract from its internal problems or to deflect blame for the parlous state of the INF treaty.\n\n\u201cHe may also be trying to send the message that, look, neither side should want this world (of a new arms race) so we should sit down and resume discussions,\u201d Reif said.\n\nPutin has said he does not want an arms race but would have no choice but to act if Washington deployed new missiles in Europe, some of which he says could strike Moscow within 10 to 12 minutes.\n\nThe United States does not currently have ground-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles that it could place in Europe but could develop and deploy them if the INF treaty collapses.\n\nPutin said his naval response to such a move would mean Russia could strike the United States faster than U.S. missiles deployed in Europe could hit Moscow because the flight time would be shorter.\n\n\u201cIt (the calculation) would not be in their favor, at least as things stand today.

That\u2019s a question that investors are pondering as Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s ties with Russia, and other stuff, finishes up.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 20, 2018\n\nDemocrats, who now control the House of Representatives, appear eager to use Mueller\u2019s findings to commence a process of defenestration. Fund managers, including so-called \u201cmacro investors\u201d who make large bets on currencies and interest rates, have a few ideas to trade what might happen next \u2013 the most intriguing of which runs through the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThere\u2019s little consensus on how measures to oust the president by constitutional means would affect financial markets. Putting aside their own political biases or personal views on Trump\u2019s stewardship, investors don\u2019t have a clear answer from history for how to position their portfolios. The two historical antecedents of the past half-century offer conflicting messages.\n\nThe last American commander-in-chief to experience impeachment by Congress was Bill Clinton, just over 20 years ago, for lying to a grand jury and obstruction of justice. The charges failed to achieve a super-majority in the Senate, needed to remove a president. In the 12 months leading up to December 19, 1998 \u2013 when the House cast its vote \u2013 the S&P 500 Index had risen 27 percent. In the following year, the index rose another 19 percent.\n\nThe case against Richard Nixon in 1974 suggests a rather different outcome. From the start of the acute phase of the Watergate scandal to Nixon\u2019s departure from the Oval Office in August that year, the average had tumbled 40 percent. In just the year leading up to his August 9 resignation, the S&P fell 23 percent. It rose just 7 percent over the next 12 months.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything to glean from the two situations, it\u2019s that broader economic conditions have more influence than politics on equity returns. In Nixon\u2019s case, some of his other policy decisions, such as withdrawal from the Bretton Woods Accord, ending the convertibility of the dollar; and geopolitics, including the Yom Kippur War and corresponding OPEC oil embargo for America\u2019s support of Israel, mattered more than impeachment or resignation.\n\nSimilarly, the booming economy of the Clinton years encouraged investors to ignore the political investigation into the Democratic president\u2019s personal infidelities. American GDP grew by more than 4 percent annually in the last two years of the 20th Century, thanks to the first internet-fueled investment boom, leading to a rare federal government fiscal surplus.\n\nInvestors still need to consider hedging their bets. The chances of an impeachment by the House are greater than zero. Betting markets, like those monitored by PredictIt, forecast a near-30 percent chance of it happening before 2020. That\u2019s in line with informal polls conducted by Breakingviews at Predictions events last month. Some 80 percent of attendees voting in New York in January gave impeachment a 30 percent or higher probability.\n\nThe bottom line comes down to whether the economy and corporate earnings would continue to grow. If two-thirds of the Senate approved removing Trump, economic policy would pass to an administration led by Vice President Mike Pence. He\u2019d likely pursue a traditional Republican agenda of lower taxes and minimised regulation \u2013 not much different from the Trump administration. All things being equal, that might help stocks.\n\nOn the other hand, the looming effects of Trump\u2019s loose fiscal policy could lead to higher interest rates, which might dampen growth and corporate earnings. Hence there\u2019s no clear direction one way or the other to posit from a Trump impeachment. Or as one investor explains cynically: \u201call the smart people who have been busy saving in the world are all going to have a different view on the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nWhich leads to Saudi Arabia. If there\u2019s one stark difference of opinion between the president and legislature, it\u2019s in their approach to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In December, a vote to end military aid for the kingdom\u2019s war in Yemen, and to blame MbS for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, received 56 votes in the Republican-led Senate, an unusual rebuke to the White House. Last week, the House voted 248-177 in favor of a similar motion.\n\nTrump will oppose any bill that crosses his desk. And neither chamber mustered sufficient support to override a presidential veto. But it illustrates how crucial \u2013 even existential \u2013 the president\u2019s support is for MbS. A weakened or impeached Trump would remove the last protection Saudi currently enjoys from the wrath of Congress. That could allow legislation such as the current bill, and additional sanctions, to become law.\n\nHow Riyadh would respond is hard to say. In the past it has weaponised the price of oil, primarily by cutting production. Even if that didn\u2019t happen, opponents of MbS could be emboldened to try to depose him, potentially disrupting oil production. Though the United States is a major energy producer, the higher oil prices that would arise from either outcome would hurt consumers, dent profits, slow the economy and hurt the stock market.\n\nHence the play. One-year options to buy West Texas Intermediate Crude at $100 a barrel currently cost about a quarter of one percent. At an average price this year of around $52 per barrel, they\u2019re way out of the money. A return to three-digit oil following a Saudi supply shock, then, would deliver a massive return. True, chaos in the kingdom would have lots of other knock-on effects, as would an abrupt end of the Trump presidency. But even in bedlam there\u2019s money to be made."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-oil-refinery/wild-cats-boas-are-obstacles-in-mexican-presidents-refinery-race-idUSKCN1QA1JA", "text": "PARAISO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s race to build an oil refinery in record time on land that was until recently alive with mangrove, wild cats and boa constrictors, has run into trouble, complicating his effort to revive ailing state-oil company Pemex.\n\nEven before Lopez Obrador took office last December, work had begun to cut down protected woodland on Pemex land on the coast of Tabasco state to make room for the new refinery next to the Dos Bocas port.\n\nBut oil industry environmental regulator ASEA in January ruled that the contractor that deforested the land did not have the correct permits to do so. The body levied a fine of about $700,000. ASEA says work on the refinery can only go ahead once a full environmental impact assessment is done and approved.\n\nThat could delay the refinery project for months or even years, just as the government is trying to boost oil output by giving the state a bigger role in the industry, modernizing refineries and building the new one in Tabasco, Lopez Obrador\u2019s home state.\n\nGustavo Alanis, president of the Mexican Center of Environmental Law advocacy group, said Pemex will run into legal problems if it continues to act in haste over the planned Dos Bocas refinery.\n\n\u201cIf they move quickly without paying heed to the laws they need to follow, they\u2019ll become their own worst enemy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government has said it plans to tender for the construction of the $8 billion refinery in March and finish building it in three years. Pemex did not respond to requests for comment for this article.\n\nHAWKS, WILD CATS\n\nThe land, near the town of Paraiso, where the new refinery is planned was planted with coconut and citrus fruit in the 1970s and expropriated by Pemex. But the company never used the terrain and tropical woodland and wildlife took over.\n\nSeveral types of plovers, herons and hawks, two species of iguanas and other reptiles, protected amphibians, threatened species of snakes and piping plovers, which are in danger of extinction, were identified in Paraiso by Conabio, a government commission in charge of studying biodiversity.\n\nFootprints of the jaguarundi, a wild cat, were found at the site, ASEA told Reuters, along with a wide variety of bird species and freshwater turtles.\n\nFisherman Manuel de la Cruz (C) speaks during an interview in Puerto Ceiba, Tabasco state, Mexico, December 10, 2018. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\n\nThe land was so rich in wildlife about a decade ago that a group of Pemex executives proposed that it be declared a private nature reserve to prevent future building there, company sources said. A study by a government institute several years ago concluded Paraiso was a risky location for a refinery because of the biodiversity found there.\n\nBut satellite pictures taken in November and obtained from Conabio show a wide belt of mangrove across the terrain has now been cut down, leaving a smaller perimeter of forest.\n\nBy the time Lopez Obrador came to Dos Bocas to announce the new refinery in December, muddy ground and heavy works machinery had replaced the site\u2019s thick tree cover.\n\nAfter the land was cleared, four threatened or protected species were rescued, including a type of porcupine, a boa constrictor and a rare iguana. Reuters could not establish the fate of the other animals the agency detected at the site.\n\nParaiso\u2019s oyster fishermen fear the refinery might harm the Mecoacan lagoon just a few miles from the refinery site, and their main source of subsistence for several generation.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is for them not to damage the lagoon,\u201d said Manuel de la Cruz, a leading local fisherman, who has worked the waterway since he was eight years old. He said he delivered a document to Lopez Obrador in December saying fishermen want more than just \u201ccrumbs\u201d of government support.\n\nSTRUGGLING OIL COMPANY\n\nLopez Obrador has not commented on ASEA\u2019s January\u2019s ruling about the clearing of the land. In its ruling, the environmental regulator also ordered the replanting of a larger mangrove area, whose location is yet to be determined, and the launching of a wildlife preservation program.\n\nMexico\u2019s energy minister, Rocio Nahle initially said the mangrove had not been touched at the Paraiso site. She said in November the municipal and state government had given permits to \u201cclean\u201d the terrain.\n\nOnly ASEA can give the permits needed for Pemex to build an industrial project on the site.\n\nThe potential delay to the refinery comes at a crucial time for Pemex.\n\nSlideshow (31 Images)\n\nLast week, the government announced a $3.9 billion bailout to stave off a threatened loss of the company\u2019s investment grade credit rating.\n\nRatings agencies say Lopez Obrador\u2019s plans to overhaul Pemex put fresh strain on its already problematic finances.

Republicans have held the seat since 1963.\n\n\u2018ILLEGAL SCHEME\u2019\n\nIt is unclear whether Harris, 52, will run again.

Harris said Dowless assured him he would not collect the ballots from the voters, which would violate state law.\n\nBut residents of at least two counties in the district said Dowless and his paid workers collected incomplete absentee ballots and, in some instances, falsely signed as witnesses and filled in votes for contests left blank, according to testimony at the hearing.\n\nHarris campaign officials said they did not pay Dowless to do anything illegal, and Dowless maintained his innocence."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-stone/judge-tightens-gag-order-on-ex-trump-adviser-stone-warning-he-could-be-jailed-idUSKCN1QA2OZ", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A visibly angry judge on Thursday ordered President Donald Trump\u2019s former political adviser Roger Stone to stop speaking publicly about U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s criminal case against him or else he will be sent to jail pending trial.\n\nIn a tense court hearing on Thursday, U.S. Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said that Stone\u2019s apology and explanations for why he posted a photo of her next to the image of the crosshairs of a gun on his Instagram account were not credible.\n\nJackson made her ruling after a highly unusual hearing in which Stone, who is charged with crimes related to Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, took the stand to testify about the posting.\n\nStone\u2019s seemingly contradictory statements and at times foggy recollections about the post\u2019s origins during a cross-examination by the government frustrated Jackson, who later concluded he \u201ccould not even keep his story straight on the stand.\u201d\n\nStone, a longtime Republican political operative, friend of Trump and self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster,\u201d was arrested on Jan. 25. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of making false statements to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering.\n\nBesides probing the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow ran an operation to hack Democratic Party computers and spread disinformation to undermine candidate Hillary Clinton and the American electoral process, Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow officials.\n\nTrump denies collusion and Russia denies allegations of meddling.\n\nStone apologized to the judge for the post on Instagram and asked for a second chance.\n\nRelated Coverage Judge orders ex-Trump aide Stone not to speak publicly about his criminal case\n\n\u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow,\u201d Jackson told Stone.\n\n\u201cWhat all of this means, Mr. Stone, is that any violation of this order will be a basis for revoking your bond and detaining you pending trial. So I want to be clear - today I gave you a second chance. But this is not baseball. There will not be a third chance.\u201d\n\nJackson had ordered Stone to appear in court to review whether the posting on his Instagram account violated his conditions of release and a narrowly tailored media gag order she imposed last week. He is out on a $250,000 bond and is free to travel without court permission to certain cities.\n\nThe media gag order did not explicitly bar Stone from speaking publicly about the case as long as he was not on courthouse grounds.\n\nHowever, it cautioned him to tread carefully and said he would not be able to complain later if he decided his own comments had tainted the jury pool.\n\nThe original posting on Monday on Stone\u2019s Instagram account not only contained a photo of Jackson next to the crosshairs, but also had text that ranted against Mueller as a \u201chitman\u201d and called Jackson \u201can Obama-appointed judge\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor in the White House.\n\nStone later took the image down and apologized, but afterwards he gave an interview on conspiracy website Infowars defending the post.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Stone said: \u201cI abused the order,\u201d Stone said. \u201cI am kicking myself over my own stupidity.\u201d\n\nRoger Stone, former political adviser of U.S. President Donald Trump, departs after a hearing where Stone said he had \"abused\" a gag order with an Instagram post that appeared to threaten U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over his criminal trial, at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2019.

So far, the investigation has ensnared 34 people.\n\nThe most tense exchanges of Thursday\u2019s hearing were during a cross-examination by prosecutor Jonathan Kravis, who repeatedly tried to get Stone to reveal who had selected the image for him.\n\nStone testified he has between five and six volunteers who come and go freely from his home and have access to his cell phone. He rattled off the names of some volunteers, but also said he could not remember all of them.\n\nAt first when asked by his lawyer Bruce Rogow if one of those volunteers had posted the image, Stone testified he did not select or review it.\n\nLater, however, Stone said he had seen the picture and posted it himself, but did not realize its implications.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, did you not just tell me under oath less than five minutes ago that someone else posted it?\u201d Jackson asked Stone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not inconsistent - I didn\u2019t choose the image.

Since 2016, his administration has purchased 17 tonnes of the metal worth around $650 million from so-called artisan miners, according to the most recent data from the nation\u2019s central bank.\n\nPaid with the country\u2019s near-worthless bank notes, these amateurs in turn supply the government with hard currency to purchase badly needed imports of food and hygiene products. This gold trade is a blip on international markets. Still, the United States is using sanctions and intimidation in an effort to stop Maduro from using his nation\u2019s gold to stay afloat.\n\nThe Trump administration is pressuring the United Kingdom not to release $1.2 billion in gold reserves Venezuela has stored in the Bank of England. U.S. officials recently castigated an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm for its Venezuela gold purchases, and have warned other potential foreign buyers to back off.\n\nThe existence of Maduro\u2019s gold program is well-known. How it functions is not.\n\nTo get a glimpse inside, Reuters tracked Venezuela\u2019s gold from steamy jungle mines, through the central bank in the capital of Caracas to gold refineries and food exporters abroad, speaking with more than 30 people with knowledge of the trade. They included miners, intermediaries, merchants, academic researchers, diplomats and government officials. Almost all requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, or because they feared retribution from Venezuelan or U.S. authorities.\n\nWhat emerges is the portrait of a desperate experiment in laissez-faire industrial policy by Venezuela\u2019s socialist leaders. U.S. sanctions have hammered the nation\u2019s oil industry and crippled its ability to borrow. The formal mining sector has been decimated by nationalization. So Maduro has unleashed freelance prospectors to extract the nation\u2019s mineral wealth with virtually no regulation or state investment.\n\nThe Bolivarian Revolution now leans heavily on ragtag laborers such as Jose Aular, a teenager who says he has contracted malaria five times at a wildcat mine near Venezuela\u2019s border with Brazil. Aular works 12 hours daily lugging sacks of earth to a small mill that uses toxic mercury to extract flecks of precious metal. Mining accidents are common in these ramshackle operations, workers said. So are shootings and robberies.\n\n\u201cThe government knows what happens in these mines and it benefits from it,\u201d said Aular, 18. \u201cOur gold goes into their hands.\u201d\n\nMaduro has also received a crucial assist from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a fellow strongman who has likewise sparred with the Trump administration.\n\nVenezuela exports part of its gold to Turkey, then uses some of the proceeds to buy that nation\u2019s consumer goods, according to opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni. Turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in Maduro\u2019s subsidized food program. Trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year.\n\nBut scrutiny is intensifying as Venezuela\u2019s politics reach the boiling point. In recent days, many Western countries have recognized Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American nation\u2019s rightful president.\n\nMaduro\u2019s adversaries have called on foreign buyers of Venezuela\u2019s precious metal to stop doing business with what they say is an illegitimate regime.\n\n\u201cWe are going to protect our gold,\u201d opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni told Reuters in an interview.\n\nGOLD FEVER\n\nThe gold road begins in places like La Culebra, an isolated jungle area in southern Venezuela. Here, hundreds of men labor in crude mining operations that would be at home in the 19th century. They excavate mineral-laden dirt with picks in hand-dug tunnels, hauling it out with pulleys and winches.\n\nTheir activity is laying waste to fragile forest ecosystems and spreading mosquito-borne diseases. Miners complain of shakedowns by military forces sent to guard the region, whose homicide rate is seven times the national average. Venezuela\u2019s ministries of defense and information did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA man melts gold at his workshop in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela August 7, 2018.

His bus driver\u2019s salary could not keep pace with Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation, which the International Monetary Fund projects will hit 10 million percent this year.\n\nThe three men net roughly 10 grams of gold monthly from backbreaking work. Still it is roughly 20 times what they could earn back home.\n\n\u201cHere I do much better,\u201d said Rondon, resting in a crude bunkhouse strung with hammocks.\n\nGold in hand, miners head to the town of El Callao to sell their nuggets. Most buyers are unlicensed, small-scale traders working in cramped shops fitted with alarms and steel doors.\n\n\u201cThe state is buying gold, everyone is buying gold, because it\u2019s what is doing well,\u201d said Jhony Diaz, a licensed wholesaler in Puerto Ordaz, 171 kilometers (106 miles) north of El Callao. Diaz says he buys gold from traders and resells every three days to the central bank.\n\nBecause Venezuela\u2019s currency, the bolivar, is worth less every hour someone holds it, the state pays a premium over international prices to make it worthwhile for those who could smuggle gold out of the country to exchange for dollars.\n\nTraders who sell to Diaz end up with bricks of cash to carry back to El Callao and other gold-rush towns to pay miners, who use it to buy food, supplies and send whatever is left to their families.\n\nGold purchased by the government is smelted in the nearby furnaces of Minerven, the state-run mining company, according to a high-ranking employee.

Both leaders have been criticized internationally for cracking down on political dissent and undermining democratic norms to concentrate power.\n\nA Nov. 1 executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump bars U.S. persons and entities from buying gold from Venezuela. It does not apply to foreigners. Ankara has assured the U.S. Treasury that all of Turkey\u2019s trade with Venezuela is in accordance with international law.\n\nVenezuela in December 2016 announced a direct flight from Caracas to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. The development was surprising given low demand for travel between the two nations.\n\nTrade data show those planes are carrying more than passengers. On New Year\u2019s Day, 2018, Venezuela\u2019s central bank began shipping gold to Turkey with a $36 million air shipment of the metal to Istanbul. It came just weeks after a visit by Maduro to Turkey.\n\nShipments last year reached $900 million, according to Turkish government data and trade reports.\n\nSocialist Party leader Tareck El Aissami during a visit to Turkey in January said Venezuela was boosting gold sales to Turkey while seeking to increase the supply of Turkish food products to Venezuela, state-owned Turkish Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nTurkish consumer products, meanwhile, are making their way to Venezuelan tables.

For SpaceX, the report mentioned the redesign of a SpaceX rocket canister following a 2016 explosion and its \u201cload and go\u201d process of fueling the rocket with the crew already inside the capsule. \u201cParachute performance\u201d remained an issue for both companies.\n\n\u201cThere are serious challenges to the current launch schedules for both SpaceX and Boeing,\u201d the report said.\n\nFor an interactive version of this story, click tmsnrt.rs/2V6pXyN\n\nTwo people with direct knowledge of the program told Reuters that the space agency\u2019s concerns go beyond the four items listed, and include a risk ledger that as of early February contained 30 to 35 lingering technical concerns each for SpaceX and Boeing. Reuters could not verify what all of the nearly three dozen items are. But the sources familiar with the matter said the companies must address \u201cmost\u201d of those concerns before flying astronauts and, eventually, tourists to space.\n\nThe NASA risk database is updated routinely during the course of NASA\u2019s stringent certification process, which includes data collection, tests and collaboration with SpaceX and Boeing, the people said. The Boeing and SpaceX systems have already been delayed several times in recent years, which is common in this sector given the complexity of building multibillion-dollar spacecraft capable of shedding earth\u2019s gravity.\n\nNASA spokesman Joshua Finch deferred all technical questions on Boeing and SpaceX systems to the companies, citing confidentiality, but said: \u201cFlying safely always takes precedence over schedule.\u201d\n\nBoeing spokesman Josh Barrett said the company \u201cclosed out\u201d the capsule\u2019s structural vulnerability risk when it completed its structural test program in January.

NASA will decide whether to approve the test flight without a crew, while SpaceX addresses the issues raised for a human mission.\n\nPARACHUTE WEAKNESSES\n\nThree people familiar with the project say the U.S. space agency has identified some design discrepancies between earlier SpaceX capsules designed to haul cargo to the International Space Station, and a newer version designed to carry humans.\n\nSome of the risks - such as those identified in the designs of the enormous parachutes that deploy when the capsule plummets back to Earth at supersonic speeds - are uncommon given how close SpaceX is to test flights, two of the people said.\n\nThe timing of deployment of the SpaceX parachutes and the interaction of the parachutes themselves have raised concerns about parachute performance, and potentially whether they will be able to slow down the capsule enough to ensure the crew\u2019s safety, two people said.\n\nSpaceX has completed 17 parachute tests for the Commercial Crew Program so far, with an additional 10 tests planned prior to Crew Dragon\u2019s second demonstration mission, Gleeson said. He also said its parachute systems are designed with redundancy so the vehicle can still safely splashdown in the event that one parachute fails.\n\nNASA\u2019s safety panel said in its report that SpaceX may be required to re-design its parachute system. A re-design would likely trigger more testing and potentially weeks or months of extra delays, two of the people said.\n\nNASA also found design problems with the system that helps orient SpaceX\u2019s capsule in an upright position once it lands in the ocean, raising the risk of taking on excessive amounts of water, according to two industry sources and confirmed by a NASA official.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Gleeson said Crew Dragon\u2019s outer shell is water-resistant, and the spacecraft itself is buoyant and does not pose a risk to crew members after splashdown.\n\nRISK OF MORE DELAYS\n\nNASA announced earlier this month that SpaceX was now targeting March 2 instead of Feb. 23 for its un-crewed Crew Dragon test flight, with its astronaut flight planned for July. NASA explained the delay by citing vague concerns for both contractors, such as the need to complete hardware testing and other work.\n\nNASA said Boeing\u2019s un-crewed Starliner would fly \u201cno earlier\u201d than April, with the crewed mission currently slated for August. This is the schedule now at risk, according to the NASA report.\n\nThe challenges in front of Boeing include last year\u2019s failure during a test of its launch-abort engines, which spilled caustic fuel on the test stand, Boeing\u2019s Barrett said.

So I want to be clear - today I gave you a second chance. But this is not baseball. There will not be a third chance.\u201d\n\nJackson had ordered Stone to appear in court to review whether the posting on his Instagram account violated his conditions of release and a narrowly tailored media gag order she imposed last week. He is out on a $250,000 bond and is free to travel without court permission to certain cities.\n\nThe media gag order did not explicitly bar Stone from speaking publicly about the case as long as he was not on courthouse grounds.\n\nHowever, it cautioned him to tread carefully and said he would not be able to complain later if he decided his own comments had tainted the jury pool.\n\nThe original posting on Monday on Stone\u2019s Instagram account not only contained a photo of Jackson next to the crosshairs, but also had text that ranted against Mueller as a \u201chitman\u201d and called Jackson \u201can Obama-appointed judge\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor in the White House.\n\nStone later took the image down and apologized, but afterwards he gave an interview on conspiracy website Infowars defending the post.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Stone said: \u201cI abused the order,\u201d Stone said. \u201cI am kicking myself over my own stupidity.\u201d\n\nRoger Stone, former political adviser of U.S. President Donald Trump, departs after a hearing where Stone said he had \"abused\" a gag order with an Instagram post that appeared to threaten U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over his criminal trial, at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2019.

So far, the investigation has ensnared 34 people.\n\nThe most tense exchanges of Thursday\u2019s hearing were during a cross-examination by prosecutor Jonathan Kravis, who repeatedly tried to get Stone to reveal who had selected the image for him.\n\nStone testified he has between five and six volunteers who come and go freely from his home and have access to his cell phone. He rattled off the names of some volunteers, but also said he could not remember all of them.\n\nAt first when asked by his lawyer Bruce Rogow if one of those volunteers had posted the image, Stone testified he did not select or review it.\n\nLater, however, Stone said he had seen the picture and posted it himself, but did not realize its implications.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, did you not just tell me under oath less than five minutes ago that someone else posted it?\u201d Jackson asked Stone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not inconsistent - I didn\u2019t choose the image.

Just like the farm bankruptcies, (the) farmland price story is similar: Some states have seen an increase, some see a decrease,\u201d Johansson said.\n\nWhile the federal government does not track large-scale farm bankruptcies, USDA does track a special category of bankruptcies for smaller to mid-sized farms - Chapter 12 filings.\n\nAccording to federal data, Chapter 12 filings have hit the highest level in a decade in parts of the U.S. Midwest and Great Plains states, where commodity grains, oilseeds and livestock producers have been adversely affected by trade conflicts.\n\nStill, the USDA said the number of these filings remained well below levels seen during the farm crisis of the 1980s, when thousands of farm operations financially collapsed after producers fell behind on high-interest land and equipment loans. This time, farmers\u2019 debt-to-asset ratios have largely held up thanks to land prices withstanding the fall.\n\nFarm incomes and agrarian credit conditions continued to erode in the second half of 2018 and for bankers, one key concern has been the amount of farmland that could come up for sale in the coming months and whether that could trigger an across-the-board fall for land prices.\n\nAlthough farmland values remained stable - or improved slightly in some areas - increasing stress in the farm sector could put downward pressure on farm real estate values moving forward, according to bankers.\n\n\u201cWhat if land values fall?

Reuters could not verify what all of the nearly three dozen items are. But the sources familiar with the matter said the companies must address \u201cmost\u201d of those concerns before flying astronauts and, eventually, tourists to space.\n\nThe NASA risk database is updated routinely during the course of NASA\u2019s stringent certification process, which includes data collection, tests and collaboration with SpaceX and Boeing, the people said. The Boeing and SpaceX systems have already been delayed several times in recent years, which is common in this sector given the complexity of building multibillion-dollar spacecraft capable of shedding earth\u2019s gravity.\n\nNASA spokesman Joshua Finch deferred all technical questions on Boeing and SpaceX systems to the companies, citing confidentiality, but said: \u201cFlying safely always takes precedence over schedule.\u201d\n\nBoeing spokesman Josh Barrett said the company \u201cclosed out\u201d the capsule\u2019s structural vulnerability risk when it completed its structural test program in January.

He also said its parachute systems are designed with redundancy so the vehicle can still safely splashdown in the event that one parachute fails.\n\nNASA\u2019s safety panel said in its report that SpaceX may be required to re-design its parachute system. A re-design would likely trigger more testing and potentially weeks or months of extra delays, two of the people said.\n\nNASA also found design problems with the system that helps orient SpaceX\u2019s capsule in an upright position once it lands in the ocean, raising the risk of taking on excessive amounts of water, according to two industry sources and confirmed by a NASA official.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Gleeson said Crew Dragon\u2019s outer shell is water-resistant, and the spacecraft itself is buoyant and does not pose a risk to crew members after splashdown.\n\nRISK OF MORE DELAYS\n\nNASA announced earlier this month that SpaceX was now targeting March 2 instead of Feb. 23 for its un-crewed Crew Dragon test flight, with its astronaut flight planned for July. NASA explained the delay by citing vague concerns for both contractors, such as the need to complete hardware testing and other work.\n\nNASA said Boeing\u2019s un-crewed Starliner would fly \u201cno earlier\u201d than April, with the crewed mission currently slated for August.

REUTERS/Alessia Pierdomenico/File Photo\n\nThat\u2019s unlikely, say competition lawyers, analysts and company insiders, so the proposal will most likely fail.\n\nThe Competition and Market Authority\u2019s (CMA) provisional view, published on Wednesday, was the deal should be blocked in the absence of the sale of a large number of stores, or even one of the brands.\n\nIt acknowledged the two companies were unlikely to be able to address its concerns.\n\n\u201cThe only way you get there is you have to have the CMA do a fundamental u-turn on the way they\u2019ve appraised it,\u201d said one person familiar with Sainsbury\u2019s thinking. \u201cAnd if they (the CMA) are playing the politics, then there\u2019s no chance they\u2019re going to do that.\u201d\n\nSainsbury and Asda have until March 13 to respond to the CMA\u2019s provisional findings and until March 6 to respond to its suggested divestment remedies. The CMA will then publish its final report by April 30.\n\nCompetition lawyers said there are few precedents for the CMA to dramatically revise its findings between provisional and final reports.\n\nSainsbury and Asda\u2019s key argument has been that Britain\u2019s grocery market is changing rapidly, driven by the growth of online and a broader range of competitors, most notably discounters Aldi and Lidl.\n\nHowever, the CMA effectively said that while new entrants are a force, it is the big four grocers - market leader Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons - who are most in competition with each other, making the Sainsbury-Asda deal a \u201cfour to three\u201d merger.\n\nLawyers said Sainsbury and Asda would have to come up with new evidence to change the CMA\u2019s thinking.\n\nWRONG FIGURES\n\n\u201cSainsbury\u2019s-Asda would need to pull something out of the bag, or they\u2019d need to show that the CMA has completely got its figures wrong,\u201d said Alex Haffner, partner and head of competition at law firm Fladgate LLP.\n\n\u201cAll they can realistically hope to achieve between now and the CMA\u2019s reporting deadline is to eat away at the size of the divestments required. They are undoubtedly facing an uphill challenge to make it work,\u201d Haffner said.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays said prior to Wednesday\u2019s ruling they had assumed a 67 percent chance of the deal proceeding. They now see a minimal chance of success.\n\nThey highlighted the CMA\u2019s view that any \u201cremedy stores\u201d would have to be sold to a single buyer, would have to be solely Sainsbury\u2019s or solely Asda\u2019s, not a mix, and be accompanied by the sale of either the Sainsbury or Asda brand name.\n\n\u201cAny one of these constraints would be painful - together they leave us skeptical that any viable package could be found,\u201d they said, arguing Amazon was the only company they could imagine being interested in buying so many stores.\n\nBut they cautioned that facilitating Amazon\u2019s scaling up in UK grocery might cost Sainsbury more in the long term. Amazon declined to comment.\n\nIf the CMA\u2019s final report differs little from its provisional findings, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda\u2019s last chance would be to challenge the ruling through the Competition Appeal Tribunal, a specialist judicial body.\n\nSainsbury Chief Executive Mike Coupe has said the company would take that route if it believed any ruling was not backed up by published evidence.\n\nCoupe, as the architect of the deal, could come under investor pressure if it fails. However, analysts speculated Sainsbury would be reluctant to jettison him given Chairman David Tyler is due to step down in March, or soon after, to be succeeded by Martin Scicluna.\n\nMeanwhile failure of the deal would block one potential exit route from Britain for Walmart. Analysts have said the U.S. group might instead consider a stock market listing of Asda or try to sell it to private equity.\n\n($1 = 0.7652 pounds)"}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-embraer-m-a-boeing/brazil-court-dismisses-lawsuit-against-proposed-embraer-boeing-deal-idUSKCN1QA1MG", "text": "FILE PHOTO: The logo of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA is seen at the company's headquarters in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil February 28, 2018.

REUTERS/Todd Korol/File Photo\n\nPipeline congestion depressed Canadian oil prices last year, prompting Cenovus and other producers to increase their reliance on rail to move crude to U.S. refineries. Alberta\u2019s provincial government imposed mandatory production cuts in January, an unusual step that succeeded in narrowing the gap - called a differential - between Canadian and U.S. prices.\n\nThat tightening has inadvertently made rail transport less profitable, and producers like Imperial Oil and Suncor Energy pulled back.\n\nBut Calgary-based Cenovus, which committed to three-year railway deals last September, is boosting rail shipments five-fold to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year. The company expects the plan will prove shrewd once Alberta lifts curtailment orders and Canada finds ways to satisfy growing U.S. heavy crude demand after sanctions against rival supplier Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThe way you get to a conclusion that rail doesn\u2019t make sense is if you believe differentials are going to remain at $10 forever,\u201d Cenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix said in an interview. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t make that bet.\u201d\n\nShipping crude by rail costs more than by pipeline, so a minimum discount of $15 to $20 per barrel for Canadian oil is generally required to cover the extra expense for buyers. Rail shipments were robust late last year after the discount on Canadian heavy oil topped a record $52 per barrel, but chugged along more slowly this month as the discount shrunk to $10.\n\nRail shipments are a critical relief valve for Alberta\u2019s oil production, which has grown in recent years while pipeline expansions stalled due to opposition. The resulting glut of Alberta crude in storage depressed prices, hurting corporate profits and accelerating investors\u2019 flight from Canada\u2019s oil patch.\n\nLESS APPEALING\n\nThe discount on Canadian heavy crude hovered on Thursday around $13, according to Net Energy Exchange. The Alberta government said on Tuesday that it will launch its own crude-by-rail program, a move that it forecasts will shrink the discount by $4 per barrel and, ironically, weaken railway economics.\n\n\u201cThe incentive to move crude by rail has been erased,\u201d Imperial Chief Executive Rich Kruger said on Feb. 1.\n\nOverall rail loadings from Canada plummeted to 156,000 bpd for the week ending Feb. 1 from a weekly record-high average of 356,000 bpd set last month, data from Genscape showed.\n\nThe conditions are different for Cenovus than for integrated producers.\n\nCenovus\u2019s business depends more on spot crude prices, as it mainly produces and sells to other refiners. Imperial and Suncor feed their own refineries with the crude they produce, allowing them to benefit even when prices are low.\n\nFor Cenovus, shipping part of its production by rail makes strategic sense because spot prices for the bulk of its output are supported when Canadian oil is flowing smoothly, said Matt Murphy, analyst at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.\n\nU.S. sanctions against Venezuela have resulted in U.S. refiners paying higher prices for Canadian crude in the Gulf than for U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate, Pourbaix said.\n\n\u201cI am highly, highly confident that rail is going to be in the money, certainly by the latter half of this year,\u201d Pourbaix said, adding that Cenovus\u2019s costs are also lower because it owns a loading facility.\n\nThe Alberta government has also said it expects Canadian oil prices to widen enough to support rail shipments this year.\n\nThose higher prices in the Gulf absorb some of the hit to Canadian shippers from a narrow differential, resulting in them limiting losses to an estimated $2 to $6 for each barrel moved there by rail, said Jackie Forrest, senior director of Calgary-based ARC Energy Research Institute.\n\nBy contrast, some shippers with long-term rail contracts lose as much as $10 by not shipping because of sunk costs and penalties, she said.\n\nBut for many, the economics no longer work.\n\n\u201cAs a refiner, I\u2019m not shipping by rail.

Washington and Beijing are looking at a 10-item list for that, including additional Chinese purchases of agricultural produce, energy and goods such as semiconductors.\n\nU.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue called China\u2019s pledges to purchase U.S. agricultural produce premature.\n\n\u201cThose proposals are all contingent upon a grand deal,\u201d he said on the sidelines of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s annual forum in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe real issue is structural reforms regarding intellectual property, enforceability of those types of provisions.\u201d\n\nThe United States could quickly recover its lost agricultural markets in China if a deal is struck, he said.\n\nPerdue has overseen $12 billion in federal aid to U.S. farmers for losses they have sustained because of the trade war.

True, the division improved underlying annual returns: ROTE rose from a dire 2.2 percent in 2017 to a middling 7.1 percent. But that compares with a UK retail lending business which bested that by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nStaley insists investment banking is core to Barclays\u2019 transatlantic corporate lending franchise. But investors don\u2019t ascribe it much value. Barclays\u2019 great UK rival, the retail focused lender Lloyds Banking Group, boasts a market capitalisation that is more than one-and-a-half times bigger than Staley\u2019s bank despite having a much smaller balance sheet.\n\nThat gives Bramson, who has put himself forward for a board seat at the lender\u2019s annual meeting, plenty to aim at. Cost slippage may be another point of contention: a target of achieving expenses of less than 60 percent of revenue, originally earmarked for this year, has been changed to \u201cover time\u201d.\n\nEven so, Staley can still just about hit a 9 percent ROTE target this year, according to a Breakingviews calculation which assumes flat revenue, one-off costs dropping to 580 million pounds, operating costs of 13.7 billion pounds and a 24 percent tax rate. That was enough to send Barclays shares, trading at a hefty 35 percent discount to tangible book, up 5 percent on Friday. Given Bramson\u2019s desire for vengeance, Staley\u2019s victory is only provisional."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lenovo-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-lenovos-reboot-could-run-low-on-battery-idUSKCN1QA09P", "text": "A Lenovo logo is seen at the computer in Kiev, Ukraine April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich/File Photo\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Lenovo\u2019s reboot could run low on battery. The world\u2019s top PC-maker more than doubled pre-tax earnings in the December quarter from a year earlier, confirming a turnaround under boss Yang Yuanqing is underway. That\u2019s mostly powered by cost cuts in the $9 billion group\u2019s handset and server units. But with demand cooling for both, a Lenovo comeback may be difficult to sustain.\n\nA combination of healthy PC sales and aggressive cost-cutting lifted earnings at the Beijing-based group to a record $350 million before tax. Sales in Lenovo\u2019s computers, tablets and devices division, which account for more than three quarters of total revenue, were up an impressive 12 percent to $11 billion, defying an industry-wide contraction. That is largely thanks to a renewed focus on the premium segment. The company also stemmed losses from its fast-growing data centre and servers unit. Critically, Lenovo finally managed to eke out a quarterly pre-tax profit of $3 million from its smartphones business - the first since Yang\u2019s disastrous bet on Motorola in 2014.\n\nShares of the Hong Kong-listed Lenovo leapt 10 percent on the back of Thursday morning\u2019s results. Of the two dozen or so analyst ratings compiled by Refinitiv, the number of \u201csells\u201d have decreased from 8 to just one since last July.\n\nThat much optimism might be excessive, however. Last year proved brutal for smartphone makers including Apple, with global volumes falling back down to 2014 levels, according to data tracker IDC. Yang\u2019s strategy of shrinking Lenovo\u2019s mobile business to focus on fewer markets helped profitability, but will do little to revive growth.\n\nChallenges loom for the data centre division too, where sales of so-called hyperscale servers used for cloud computing were up by triple-digit percent in the recent quarter. Growth in the overall server market worldwide is forecast to slow from 5 percent last year to just 2 percent in 2019, estimates industry analysis group TrendForce. Catching up to market leaders Dell EMC, HPE, and China\u2019s Inspur will only get tougher.\n\nLenovo must also brawl with rivals over the shrinking PC market. To Yang\u2019s credit, the company has gained share and improved margins. But with shares up over 60 percent over the past 12 months, it needs a more reliable power supply."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sainsburys-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-walmart-is-smallest-loser-in-uk-supermarket-salvo-idUSKCN1Q91QW", "text": "Shopping bags from Asda and Sainsbury's are seen in Manchester, Britain April 30, 2018.\n\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Walmart may be the smallest loser in the UK supermarket shakeout. British competition watchdogs released a damning view on the 7.3 billion pound tie-up of J Sainsbury and Asda, owned by the U.S. giant. The verdict leaves both groups struggling to fend off discounters Aldi or Lidl. At least Asda has its parent\u2019s global clout.\n\nHigher prices and a poorer shopping experience \u2013 that\u2019s what shoppers can expect from the creation of the UK\u2019s biggest grocer, according to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Both parties had hoped for a more lenient opinion than an initial review last year, as this one took account of the threat of Amazon, and the growing market share of the German discounters.\n\nThe CMA has not blocked the deal, but it now looks unappealing. The regulator reckons that competition could be a concern for supermarkets in 629 areas, nearly half of Sainsbury\u2019s grocery business. The combined entity may need to sell so many stores that the benefits of the deal would be completely lost.\n\nThe battle may go to court, but both parties must already be thinking about alternatives. Either could try to do a deal with the fourth-biggest player, WM Morrison Yet bankers worry that the CMA\u2019s hawkish approach may rule that out too, as it suggests that any merger between the large players will need to leave behind as many as 10 competing stores in some areas, according to one source close to the deal.\n\nThe news is a blow for Walmart, for whom the transaction looked like an elegant way to exit the UK. It could sell to a private equity firm, but there may be few takers, given the sector\u2019s sluggish growth. The bad news does come at a relatively good time: Asda has enjoyed seven consecutive quarters of sales growth, thanks to its ability to offer cheaper own-brand products and drive bargains with suppliers. Having the might of a $290 billion owner helps.\n\nThat leaves Sainsbury\u2019s in an awkward spot. A decline in its general merchandise business, inherited through the Argos purchase, made it the slowest-growing of the big four grocers over Christmas. And pressure from discounters will get worse, with Tesco and Morrisons launching cheap brands. Its best bet may be to scoop up smaller rivals, and use the savings to cut prices. That may still leave rivals scope to raid its shelves."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-economics-breakingviews/breakingviews-hadas-profit-and-innovation-go-different-ways-idUSKCN1Q929D", "text": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - American companies are looking weak when it comes to technological innovation. When it comes to corporate earnings, however, it\u2019s a whole different story.\n\nSilhouettes of laptop and mobile device users are seen next to a screen projection of Google logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nThe economist Robert Gordon was one of the first to proclaim a slowdown of growth at what he called the \u201ctechnological frontier\u201d. In 2012, the Northwestern University economist predicted the gains from the computer revolution \u2013 the latest frontier \u2013 were winding down.\n\nThe theory is contentious. But one sign of this technological maturity would be a decrease in the productivity of research spending. Each breakthrough would require more effort than the last. Research by Nicholas Bloom and three co-authors suggest that is what is happening.\n\nThe researchers, from Stanford University and MIT, compared U.S. spending on research and development with increases in reported labour productivity. The result is clear \u2013 the system needs a lot more fuel to keep improving at the same pace. More precisely, the academics calculated that it would take a doubling of research effort every 13 years just to avoid a productivity slowdown.\n\nThat slowdown has not been avoided. A 2017 report from the McKinsey Global Institute points out that average annual U.S. productivity growth was 2.1 percent between 1987 and 2004. In the subsequent decade, the average rate was 1.2 percent, and the trend has been downward.\n\nOf course, some parts of the economy are still leaping ahead. For example, big data is rapidly getting more tractable, and therefore more valuable. But behind such technological frontiers lies an ever-growing mass with slowing progress.\n\nBloom and his colleagues also looked at a few key industries. Their conclusion about crop yields is typical: \u201cyield growth is relatively stable or even declining, while the effective research that has driven this yield growth has risen tremendously.\u201d\n\nSome, including Gordon, regret the slowing pace of innovation. It makes more sense to recognise how far technology has come. People in developed societies already have enough of it to live long, safe, comfortable and stimulating lives. And even with slower progress from here, there is probably enough forward momentum to address current challenges and find new opportunities.\n\nHowever, slowing innovation should also change the structure of competitive markets. If the stream of breakthroughs is thinner, fewer companies should be able to enjoy large and durable competitive advantages. On this more level corporate playing field, the industry standard would be slower productivity growth and smaller market share gains. That, economic theory says, should lead to narrowing profit margins.\n\nTwo New York University professors suggest that this economic logic has been partly right. A paper by German Gutierrez and Thomas Philippon looked at the largest American companies, both overall and by industry. They found that the trend lines for these \u201cstar\u201d firms changed dramatically around the year 2000.\n\nFor example, they measured the contribution to annual national productivity growth of the four largest companies by market capitalisation in 62 industries \u2013 a group that has included Google owner Alphabet, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. The companies at the top shifted over the years, so the list always included the winners of the period. From 1960 to 2000, the annual average contribution to productivity growth of these 248 companies was 0.72 percentage points. From 2001 to 2016, the average was 0.43.\n\nThe pattern is similar for market shares. Domestic sales of the 248 industry leaders accounted for 29 percent of GDP in 1980. That fell to 25 percent in 2016. There are not enough all-conquering star companies to hold off the levelling effect of slowing technological gains.\n\nHowever, one aspect of corporate performance has not behaved as economic theory says it should. Dwindling competitive advantages have not hurt the bottom line. Indeed, U.S. government statistics show that the ratio of corporate profit to national income has averaged 6.7 percent for the last 10 years, up from a 5 percent average between 1991 and 2000.\n\nThose higher earnings did not fund increased capital spending. On the contrary, private investment declined in the same periods \u2013 from 17.6 percent of GDP to 16.2 percent.\n\nIt has clearly been much easier for managers to push forward financially than technologically. Or perhaps it has just been more rewarding for them. After all, executive remuneration packages are mostly geared to higher earnings and share prices.\n\nThe divergence of trends in technology and profit does not seem fair. In effect, shareholders of American companies are extracting more from businesses that are providing less innovation and making fewer investments.\n\nOf course, bosses are not paid to worry about such matters. The can talk up whatever technical progress they make, without thinking too much about the big picture. And as signed-up members of the cult of shareholder value, the idea that profit can be excessively high is anathema.\n\nPoliticians are in a different position. They are supposed to think about justice. They have powerful weapons, including taxes on corporate profit, antitrust regulation and rules on collusion. With these tools, they could probably change the trends in profit and productivity. That would be tough on shareholders, but it might just be good for society."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyds-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-brexit-and-costs-cloud-lloyds-sunlit-uplands-idUSKCN1Q919V", "text": "Customers use ATMs at a branch of Lloyds Bank in London, Britain, February 21, 2017.\n\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Brexiteers like to describe the \u2018sunlit uplands\u2019 awaiting the nation\u2019s departure from the European Union. Investors in the country\u2019s largest retail bank aren\u2019t so sure. Lloyds Banking Group shares look cheap when weighed against CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio\u2019s plan to hit a 15 percent return on equity. That relies on a steep fall in one-off costs and an easy Brexit.\n\nSo far the latter has left Lloyds\u2019 profit blissfully undisturbed. Sure, loan losses increased by nearly one-fifth year-on-year, but from an extremely low base to a manageable 937 million pounds. Rather, it was the fall in so-called \u2018one-off\u2019 items which helped drive up profit: pre-tax profit increased by 13 percent year-on-year to 5.9 billion pounds due largely to a decrease in provisions for missold payment protection insurance (PPI). The return on tangible equity rose 2.8 percentage points to 11.7 percent.\n\nHorta-Osorio thinks he can repeat the trick this year, and is promising a 14 percent to 15 percent return. Maybe. PPI provisions should fall further, given an August deadline for compensation. So should nearly 900 million pounds in restructuring charges given the integration of credit card lender MBNA is largely complete. The snag is that supposedly exceptional charges have bedevilled Lloyds for years.\n\nIf Lloyds can roughly halve the one-off nasties to 1.4 billion pounds, plus lower operating expenses by another 200 million pounds to around 8 billion pounds, Horta-Osorio can just about hit his 14 percent minimum return target, according to a Breakingviews calculation which assumes flat revenue, a 20 percent rise in bad debts similar to last year, and a 27 percent tax rate. A share buyback would nudge it further towards the 15 percent upper-end target.\n\nThe trickier bit is Brexit. A chaotic exit, or even extended period of political uncertainty, would push up loan losses. Analysts are already pencilling in a roughly 37 percent year-on-year jump to 1.3 billion pounds, according to Refinitv. Given that Lloyds has massively grown its share of unsecured lending, where losses heavily correlate with unemployment, that could prove optimistic.\n\nHorta-Osorio can at least plausibly argue that Brexit is out of Lloyds\u2019 control. His stock is trading at 1.1 times book tangible book value, suggesting the market is not panicking, but not giving him full credit for the 15 percent target. Increasing the premium remains contingent on goodwill between London and Brussels.

REUTERS/Stringer ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. CHINA OUT.\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China bears and bulls can pick their data in the Year of the Pig. Stock markets are charging; bonds defaulting. Lunar New Year holiday spending was weak, but January exports boomed. State-owned companies and contradictory industrial and monetary policies are muddying traditional performance measures. They betray an economy going in two directions at once.\n\nEconomic distortions introduced by the festival, which falls in January or February depending on the year, make it dangerous to extrapolate trends. But 2019 was extreme even by Chinese standards.\n\nThe \u201cGolden Week\u201d holiday takes an early snapshot of consumer confidence. It looked ugly: retail sales cooled to 8.5 percent, the first instance of single-digit growth since 2005, says Nomura. Combined with anemic inflation and falling imports, demand looked bleak.\n\nAnd yet luxury group Hermes reported sterling revenue growth in China in the fourth quarter, as did rival LVMH. Another economic bellwether, Yum China, served up more fried chicken than expected, with same-store sales rising 2 percent. The benchmark CSI300 index is up 14 percent year-to-date. The critical real estate market looks stable enough, and trade data was a happy surprise.\n\nBeijing relies on tools designed to track the performance of a simpler, investment-driven economy. They are poor at capturing nuance, and the task is complicated by the intrusion of state-owned companies into non-strategic sectors, and the fact that retail statistics capture government purchases. Regional disparities have widened in recent years too, distorting national averages.\n\nMonetary policy is another factor. Stimulus is supposed to target productive companies without fuelling asset bubbles. This helps explain why bond defaults are up even as rates ease and lending revives. Yet most Chinese private firms, lacking easy access to loans and fixed-income markets, are accustomed to making do with minimal leverage. Credit is neither their biggest problem nor an easy solution to their ills.\n\nAs for companies, revenue growth varies widely depending on the product line, the target customer \u2013 and the presence or absence of state subsidies. The withdrawal of tax incentives, for example, is largely to blame for correcting auto sales. In short, the People\u2019s Republic is no longer generating an economic tide capable of lifting, or sinking, all boats. Is the economy on its way up, or down? Yes."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vegan-climatechange-breakingviews/breakingviews-veganism-may-prove-a-more-durable-diet-fad-idUSKCN1Q827L", "text": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The latest diet trend may prove more durable than previous fads. Concerns about climate change and animal welfare - as well as healthy eating - are prompting more consumers to embrace veganism. Like the low-carb trend of the early 2000s, companies are scrambling to keep up with changing consumer tastes. But the shift to shunning animal products looks more than a flash in the pan.\n\nAn activist from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) demonstrates in front of the Louvre Museum Pyramid in Paris, France, February 7, 2019. Placard reads: \"Vegan, for animals, the planet and future generations\".\n\nLike other diet crazes, veganism has shifted from the culinary choices of a dedicated minority to the mainstream. Prompted by endorsements from screen stars like Joaquin Phoenix and Ellen DeGeneres, big companies have responded. In the past few months, McDonald\u2019s has added a vegetarian happy meal to its menu of fast-food burgers and chicken, while Unilever, acquired meat-free food company The Vegetarian Butcher. Meanwhile private equity giant KKR played up the plant-based credentials of margarine when it snapped up the Anglo-Dutch food giant\u2019s spreads business for 6.8 billion euros last year.\n\nConsumers are receptive. British baker Gregg\u2019s, whose sandwiches and sugary cakes can be found on most high streets, sparked a social media storm when it started selling vegan-friendly sausage rolls in January. The company said on Tuesday that publicity around the meat substitute had helped attract more customers, boosting like-for-like sales by almost 10 percent in the first seven weeks of the year.\n\nInvestors have seen such sudden shifts before. In the early 2000s, consumers embraced the Atkins diet, which advocated losing weight by shunning carbohydrates in favour of proteins like - ironically - meat and eggs. Rob Lowe and Jennifer Aniston endorsed the lifestyle. Brewers scrambled to develop low-carbohydrate beers. SlimFast blamed the diet for denting sales of its shakes. However, the craze gradually faded.\n\nVeganism looks to have staying power, though. The diet is more about living an ethical lifestyle - sparing animals and eschewing farming techniques that generate greenhouse gases and consume excess water - than it is about shedding pounds. Demographics also point to continued growth. Vegan, vegetarian or so-called flexitarian diets, which involve cutting back on meat, are more popular with young and relatively well-off urban residents than with their older and less affluent counterparts. Some 60 percent of UK students expect vegan and vegetarian food at their university in 2017, according to Sodexo\u2019s International University Lifestyle Survey.\n\nAnd while Britain and Germany have led the charge, big meat-loving countries are catching up. According to Nielsen, 39 percent of Americans are trying more meat alternatives. In France, the home of foie gras, sales of vegan and vegetarian products grew by 24 percent to 380 million euros last year, and are expected to grow by a further 17 percent each year until 2021, according to research firm Xerfi.\n\nYet ordinary investors may find it difficult to cash in on the trend. Though UK supermarkets have dedicated more shelf space to vegan products, the contribution to overall sales is minimal. Companies like Tofutti Brands, which sells dairy-free cream cheese, and Hain Celestial Group, known for its almond milk, are not entirely vegan-focused.\n\nMeanwhile millions of people in less-developed countries for whom meat was once a rare treat remain eager to consume more milk, eggs, chicken and beef as they grow wealthier. So global consumption of animal products looks set to keep expanding.\n\nEven so, dedicated vegan companies can benefit. Beyond Meat, a U.S. purveyor of burgers and sausages made from plants, is planning an initial public offering. The business, which attracted Microsoft founder Bill Gates as an early investor, in November reported sales jumped 167 percent to $56.4 million in the first nine months of 2018 from a year earlier. Finland\u2019s Golden & Green Foods is pushing boundaries with its pulled oats - an alternative to pulled pork or chicken that is made out of oats and beans. The market for these plant-based proteins is expected to reach $16.3 billion by 2026, according to Persistence Market Research.\n\nLaunching such products is far from easy. It took Gregg\u2019s 18 months to develop its flaky vegan sausage roll. Quorn, which makes the meat substitute used in the roll, says it often takes around five years to produce vegan products that are palatable to consumers. But companies should be able to tap new sources of financing, since vegan products appeal to investors looking for sustainable investments.\n\nThere\u2019s always a risk that consumer tastes swing back towards meat and dairy products. But vegans can say they are helping to save the world, one bean burger at a time. That\u2019s not a claim previous diet fads could make."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-women-breakingviews/breakingviews-the-exchange-fixing-techs-gender-disparity-idUSKCN1Q82K8", "text": "Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

It is a wholesaler of news \u2013 in the form of text stories, photographs and video footage \u2013 to the media industry. Clients pay a subscription which entitles them to use Reuters news stories, pictures or video footage in their papers, magazines, websites or news bulletins.\n\nOpen any major daily newspaper and you will see that much of the news, particularly international or \u2018foreign\u2019 news, comes from agencies such as Reuters. This is because most papers only have a handful of journalists based in countries other than the one they publish in. Agencies, however, have large networks of correspondents, photographers and cameramen around the world.\n\nInternational news agencies tend to focus on the major stories of any country \u2013 those that are likely to be of interest beyond that country\u2019s boundaries. Reuters covers the main political and economic news from all the countries it is based in, as well as some that it isn\u2019t allowed to operate from such as Iraq and Angola. It also covers financial news about the leading companies of a country, its stock market and its local currency. The rest of its news output consists of coverage of major sports around the world such as football, tennis and golf; major disasters ranging from train crashes to volcanic eruptions; and stories about bizarre events.\n\nThe sources of an agency\u2019s news coverage varies widely. Every office compiles a comprehensive diary of routine events that have to be covered: a government minister\u2019s speech, the publication an economic indicator such as inflation data, or a major company\u2019s annual general meeting. Unexpected news about both politics and finance will often come from a tip off from a good contact or source, be a trader at the local stock exchange or the aide to a politician. News about local disasters often come from the local media, often TV, or from eyewitness reports.\n\nWhatever medium the journalist is working in \u2013 text, pictures or video \u2013 he or she needs to check their facts. If it\u2019s a text story the journalist will ring the subject of a story and ask for an official comment. They will probably ring a few experts to get their opinions \u2013 unlike newspapers, agencies never give their spin to a story, their job is to report the facts and the reaction to them. Both photographers and cameramen also have to check their facts so they can write the accompanying caption or script to go with their photos or video footage.\n\nBefore the news is transmitted to clients it is checked by an editor to ensure the facts are correct and that it doesn\u2019t conflict with anything already published by the agency on that story. Unlike newspapers there is no need to cut the story or crop the picture to fit it to a page. The whole story or complete picture is published to the clients who then choose how much or how little of it to use. For the same reason, very few stories are spiked (never published) by an agency.\n\nDeadlines don\u2019t exist at agencies and you write the story or produce the pictures or video as soon as you can after an event. For that reason, and because we are based in so many countries around the world, there\u2019s a steady stream of news pouring through Reuters 24 hours a day, seven days a week."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/203039183-Copyrights-and-Reprints", "text": ""}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215713683-What-is-Reuters-policy-regarding-Privacy-Data-protection-", "text": "This can be found at Reuters home page - in the privacy footer.

La \u00fanica manera de frenar la nueva devaluaci\u00f3n es aumentando las tasas de (letras) \u2018Leliq\u2019 e interviniendo fuerte en el mercado de futuros. La presi\u00f3n inflacionaria es grande y por eso la tensi\u00f3n del mercado\u201d, resalt\u00f3 un agente de la banca privada.\n\n* El BCRA debi\u00f3 aumentar considerablemente el mi\u00e9rcoles la tasa de \u2018Leliq\u2019 a 46,014 por ciento anual, desde un 44,486 por ciento del martes. Este comportamiento alcista se registra desde el viernes \u00faltimo, inclusive.\n\n* Por su parte, el peso en la franja informal transitaba a contramano mediante un avance del 0,63 por ciento con escuetas anotaciones, a 39,25/39,50 por cada d\u00f3lar, contra un nivel piso de 41,50 vendedor alcanzado a fin de diciembre.\n\n* El \u00edndice accionario S&P Merval perd\u00eda un 0,43 por ciento, a 36.347,97 puntos, liderado por ventas sobre papeles financieros. En sentido contrario, se destacaba una leve mejora en los t\u00edtulos de la gigante sider\u00fargica Tenaris tras reportar un buen balance corporativo en 2018.\n\n* Los bonos extraburs\u00e1tiles argentinos ascend\u00edan en promedio un 0,2 por ciento, en medio de una notoria selectividad de transacciones, con un riesgo pa\u00eds elaborado por el banco JP.Morgan que bajaba siete unidades a 708

The windows don\u2019t even have any glass. Navesh Chitrakar, Reuters Photographer\n\nMy journey on the great railways of India began on October 23, 2012. The trip not only marked my first visit to India, it was also the first time that I had ever travelled on real trains because my home country, Nepal, does not have a proper rail network.\n\nEverything about the trains was new to me, which made it really exciting. I started out from Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station in Delhi and headed towards Agra with the help of a railway atlas, a train map and a fixer. I had been provided with the fixer\u2019s assistance for a couple days thanks to my chief photographer Ahmad Masood, one of the generous people who gave me a lot of help to complete this story.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to get used to train travel; I understand and speak Hindi, and most of the people on the trains were very friendly and helpful. Most of the time I was doing what I was there to do: observing and trying to capture the most significant and fascinating aspects of India\u2019s railways.\n\nIn a country that is the seventh largest in the world by area and the second largest in the world by population, the Indian railway network reaches almost everywhere and carries commuters from one end of the country to the other. The network is a lifeline for India and for the Indians who use it.\n\nAnd why not take advantage of it? People prefer trains because they are a cheaper and faster way to travel. When you travel India by rail, everything is going on around you; it seems like the railway has created its own world and the running of that world depends on the running train.\n\nEvery time a train arrives at a platform with its horns blasting, everything suddenly gets going. It feels like the train brings life to the station and when it leaves it carries that life elsewhere; the station falls back to sleep and waits for another train to come along and wake it up again.\n\nI had great hopes when I reached Mumbai, but it was not an easy place to shoot pictures, especially in a train station. I had to get authorisation to shoot and that would have been impossible without the hard work of my two good colleagues, Vivek Prakash and Danish Siddiqui.\n\nWe failed to get the go ahead the first time I went to Mumbai, and things didn\u2019t work out as we planned so I had to go back after a couple of weeks and do it all over again. It was a good lesson for us to learn as we grew and explored how to handle challenges and make things happen the way we planned and wanted them.\n\nIn my three months of travelling thousands of kilometers by train, I learned about and saw almost all the aspects of India\u2019s railways - both good and bad. I travelled in local trains, passenger trains, general compartments, sleeper trains, 3rd class, 2nd class and 1st class.\n\nThe most difficult journeys were on the local, passenger and general compartments, where there are usually no seats to sit down over long distances and the train is overcrowded. It is a common site to see people smoking in these compartments, even though this is strictly forbidden.\n\nThe fans don\u2019t work, and forget about air conditioning! The windows don\u2019t even have any glass. People were forced to hang onto the door as the train moved because the compartment was too crowded. These were the conditions that people who didn\u2019t have enough money for a comfortable journey had to suffer. On the other hand, there were also trains that were luxury itself, with all the facilities of a good hotel.\n\nI am glad that I had the opportunity to experience India\u2019s great railways and to learn a lot from my journey. The running of the network is truly amazing; it is almost unimaginable how services are managed on such a large scale.\n\nI think everyone should travel at least once on the trains to feel the real excitement and adventure of India\u2019s great railways, which probably don\u2019t have an equivalent anywhere else in the world. What\u2019s more, every day, new tracks are being laid. The Great Indian Railway is getting greater by the day."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://widerimage.reuters.com/story/feed", "text": ""}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://widerimage.reuters.com/story/placards-outside-monastery-expose-abuse-in-spanish-church", "text": "Advertisement\n\nStory Tourists and worshippers visiting Catalonia's imposing mountain-side Montserrat Monastery on a sunny Sunday this month appeared to pay little heed to two men with placards demanding that the local abbot be defrocked for covering up sexual abuse. But the pair, who say they were sexually abused in their youth, are making themselves heard by society in Spain and elsewhere as they pressure the Catholic Church to come clean on such wrongdoing by clergy. The Vatican is holding an unprecedented meeting of senior bishops from around the world, experts and heads of male and female religious orders on Feb. 21-24 to discuss how to tackle sexual abuse. Miguel Hurtado, 36, runs an online petition to Spanish authorities to significantly extend the statute of limitations for sexual abuse against minors. The petition on website change.org has received over 520,900 signatures since it launched in 2016.\n\nHurtado poses for a portrait inside the church of the Montserrat Abbey.\n\nStory Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who is facing an early general election in April, said on the petition website that he would study the proposals and act to prevent that kind of crime. In Spain, historically a fervently Catholic country, activists say thousands of cases had likely been silenced and many could emerge now as the debate opens up. \"For me, the worst part were not the abuses, but the Church covering it up.\" Miguel Hurtado He said the abbot of Montserrat, Josep Maria Soler, had for years sought to silence his accusation that monk Andreu Soler sexually molested him 20 years ago when he was a 16-year-old Boy Scout in a group led by the monk. The monk, who shared the same last name but was not related to the abbot, died in 2008.\n\nMonk robes hang together during a mass at Montserrat Abbey. Hurtado said his abuser, 50 years his senior, touched his genitals under the pretext of telling him masturbation was wrong, and tried to tongue-kiss him, which left him \"petrified, without knowing what to do\". The monastery said in a statement to the media last month that the abbot had known about Hurtado's accusations since taking over in 2000 and that it paid 8,600 euros ($9,740) to cover Hurtado's therapy costs and expenses with lawyers in 2003. The monastery promised \"to act with complete transparency\" and asked for \"forgiveness for everything where it has not lived up to expectations\" adding it had always been guided by a desire to help Hurtado. The monastery declined to provide any further comment to Reuters on Hurtado's demands for the abbot to be fired. It also declined a request to interview the abbot. The abbot told the congregation on Feb. 3, the day of Hurtado's protest: \"We humbly ask the victims for forgiveness, sympathise with their pain and offer them our support. Sexual abuse of minors by the priests are deeply hurtful because they ... betray the confidence deposited in them.\"\n\nThe cross of Saint Michael is seen in the surroundings of the Montserrat Abbey. The monk, who \"always maintained a different version of what occurred\" was transferred in 2000 \"out of precaution\", the monastery said. Since Hurtado went public with his accusations in January, eight people have denounced the same monk for having sexually abused them years ago, according to Spanish media. Standing beside Hurtado on Feb. 3 with a sign demanding \"Transparency and Responsibility at Montserrat\" was Briton Peter Saunders, the founder of the British National Association for People Abused in Childhood. Until 2017, he sat on the Vatican's Commission for the Protection of Minors set up by Pope Francis in 2014. \"The Vatican hopes that we'll just go away and leave them be, but it isn't gonna happen,\" he said, adding that he doubted the sincerity of the pope's \"zero tolerance\" stance toward abusers and cover-ups because he said Francis had sanctioned the reinstatement of various clerics accused of these crimes.\n\nFernando Garcia-Salmones, 58, says he was raped by a priest from his school when he was 14. \"The first reaction from the Church about the abuses has been to say that no homosexual will be allowed in seminaries. This is not about homosexuality, this is about power,\" Garcia-Salmones said. The Church has repeatedly been criticised for its handling of the sexual abuse crisis, which exposed how predator priests were moved from parish to parish instead of being defrocked or turned over to civilian authorities around the world.\n\nOn a rainy afternoon in 1975 Garcia-Salmones was by himself at his school's playground when he was called into the room of his abuser to get dry. \"He realised I was vulnerable and helpless, a lonely little mouse, \" he said. When Garcia-Salmones decided to take the case to the courts in 1995, it had already run its statute of limitations. Some changes are under way in Spain. On Feb. 12, the regional bishops' conference that includes Montserrat issued an apology to all victims of abuse. Last November, a senior Spanish bishop, Gil Tamayo, said there is \"complicit silence\" of the Spanish Church on sex abuse cases. The government has drafted a bill that would extend the statute of limitations, although not as much as Hurtado proposes. It has not been submitted to parliament.\n\nThe headlights of a passing car in illuminate the entrance to the gym of the school where Garcia-Salmones says he was raped by a priest. On Saturday, the Vatican sent what some saw as a warning that it would get tough with bishops who have either committed abuse or covered it up. It expelled former U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick from the priesthood after he was found guilty of sexual crimes against minors and adults. Hurtado, who is scheduled to meet the Vatican summit's organising committee on Wednesday along with 11 other victims, says the Montserrat abbot should have reported his case to the police while the statute of limitations still allowed it, instead of paying what he said was \"money for my silence\". He said he returned the money in 2015, except for 1,400 euros paid in lawyer's fees, after learning that the abbey published a book praising his abuser in 2007. The monastery confirmed he returned the money, which it said was donated to charity. It said the abbot had apologised for the book to Hurtado and had promised to remove it from the monastery's catalogue.\n\nThe Padres Trinitarios school where Conde says she was raped. Under Spanish law, victims of molestation cases that do not involve rape have five years after they have turned 18 to seek justice. More serious cases can be reported 15-20 years past the age of 18. Hurtado hopes to lift the initial threshold after which the statute of limitations kicks in to 50 from 18 years.\n\nConde points at a picture of herself at the age of 15. Such an extension would apply to cases similar to that of Teresa Conde, 52 and a philosophy teacher from Salamanca, who says she was raped by a priest 30 years her senior when she was 14.

But this town provides her with something that she did not have in her former home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras - safety.\n\nHere, at least, she can go out.\n\nCarolina and her younger sister Rachel rollerblade together near their trailer. \"There are many gang members (in San Pedro Sula) and they are basically in charge, the streets are really dangerous,\" her mother, Orfa, said in an interview earlier this month. \"I almost never went out, I stayed at home with the children.\" Reuters is withholding the surnames of the family to protect their identity because of their uncertain status and fear of Honduran gangs.\n\nOrfa and her children Rachel, Carolina and Bayron get back onto a bus following a stop in Alamogordo.

Orfa set out with her three children in early 2018 to make the approximately 2,700-mile (4,300-km) journey through Mexico to the United States. They joined one of the 'caravans' of thousands of Central American migrants that have made the trip over the past year in hopes of securing asylum in the United States.\n\nOrfa's daughter Rachel plays in the living room as President Donald Trump is shown on a newscast. An incensed U.S. President Donald Trump has called the migrants \"a tremendous onslaught,\" sent troops to the border, and pushed for tougher controls and a far more extensive border wall. After a gruelling six-week journey of walking, riding on top of trains, and hitching lifts, in which the family relied largely on the kindness of strangers to eat, they wound up at a shelter in Tijuana. The Mexican border city has become the temporary home for hundreds of caravan migrants, who wait for their turn, sometimes for months, to formally request asylum in the United States. Accompanied by minors, Orfa's turn to apply came after a week. The family was transferred to a detention center in Texas, and then released from custody to await future court appearances, suggesting authorities believed the family had demonstrated what the U.S. government calls \"credible fear\" of returning home. Trump has derided this practice, referring to it as \"catch and release.\"\n\nOrfa comforts a fellow migrant as she cries following their release from ICE detention. In San Antonio's bus terminal, the family and other caravan members said emotional goodbyes as they took buses to different parts of the United States.

That, along with a trend toward mixing synthetic opiate fentanyl in Mexico's tarry black heroin, has slashed what criminal gangs pay farmers like Sanchez for a kilo of opium. Now, Sanchez earns about $260 per kilo, a fifth of the average price two years ago. While Mexico's top drug traffickers still make billions of dollars supplying U.S. addicts, at the bottom of the supply chain, the villagers are hardly surviving.\n\nSanchez stands next to opium paste. \"We can't keep living like this,\" said Sanchez, who is a local leader in the remote Mixtec Indian village of Juquila Yucucani, where hundreds of poppy farmers have seen already meager incomes shrivel. \"We can barely afford our food.\" In the United States, overdose deaths from opioids have increased almost six-fold in the past two decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 15,000 people died of heroin overdoses in 2017 alone. Heroin from Mexico accounted for 86 percent of the heroin found on U.S. streets, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency's most recent annual narcotic report.\n\nSoldiers burn an illegal opium plantation near Pueblo Viejo in the Sierra Madre del Sur. The heart of illegal poppy cultivation is in the hills of Guerrero state, in some of the poorest mountain districts - such as Juquila Yucucani, some 800 miles south of the U.S.-Mexican border. Guerrero is now among the country's bloodiest states. Despite unprecedented violence across the country, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said last week that the government had \"officially\" ended its war against drug trafficking, a military-led offensive launched in 2006 that led to a surge in bloodshed as criminal groups splintered.\n\nA man walks in front of a local church of Yucucani. The government's focus will now be on meeting the needs of marginalized communities, Lopez Obrador said, as part of a broader strategy to curb an illegal drug trade that is thriving despite the capture of high-profile kingpins like Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, who is on trial in New York for drug trafficking that spanned more than two decades.\n\nSoldiers cut opium poppies as they destroy a field of illegal plantation in the Sierra Madre del Sur. Lopez Obrador has not entirely turned his back on using soldiers to tackle violence stemming from drugs - he plans to create a new militarized National Guard police force. But he is also exploring a crop substitution program, relaxing prohibition and amnesties for low level drug dealers and farmers. On a visit to Guerrero in January, Lopez Obrador pledged price supports for grains, including around $300 a tonne for corn, part of a strategy meant to give farmers alternatives to planting illicit crops.\n\nPoppy farmer Francisco Santiago Clemente walks in a corn field in Yucucani. \"Here, in the hills, we are going to pay a little more, so that corn is planted and people are compensated for their effort. So that other crops are not planted,\" he said. Lopez Obrador has backed a legislative bill to legalize marijuana, and along with the former head of Mexico's military and other members of his team, he suggested last autumn that legalizing medical opium could be part of the solution. The government appears to be backing away from that idea after opposition from the United States.\n\nA woman tends to her opium poppy plant outside her house in Yucucani. The farmers in Juquila Yucucani do not consider themselves criminals, and say current poppy eradication efforts by the army also sometimes destroy legal crops. \"They have killed the food crops that my family use to eat,\" said Lazaro Lopez, 65, who said the military should apologize. Although Reuters could not independently verify Lopez's account, human rights groups have documented military abuses in parts of Guerrero. The army did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nSeeds of the opium poppy plant. For Sanchez, who said his village would embrace legalization, crop substitution is a poor alternative. Other than poppies, few plants take to the thin soil on Juquila Yucucani's stony slopes. Some land is apt for planting mango or avocado trees, Sanchez said, but they would take years to mature. The narrow ribbon of twisted dirt road connecting the village to the outside world would make it almost impossible to transport bulky or delicate crops to markets, he added.\n\nSoldiers patrol area on their way to the Sierra Madre del Sur. Arturo Garcia, a farmers rights activist in the state, said the government's new ideas would only work if a really sustained and well-funded effort were made to offer residents a way out of the drug trade. \"The state must throw all its weight into this region so that it begins to alleviate the conditions that have allowed violence,\" he said.\n\nNieves Garcia reacts next to her husband.\n\nStory For now, several hours journey from the nearest hospitals or schools, Juquila Yucucani's poppy farmers say they have two choices to make a living: sneak illegally into the United States, or grow poppies. \"We are not drug traffickers, we want a dignified life,\u201d said elderly Nieves Garcia, who has grown poppies since she was a child and speaks a variant of the indigenous Mixtec language, but no Spanish. \"My kids have left this place because there's no way of getting ahead,\" she said.

The administration says it would reduce regulatory costs for automakers by more than $300 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe administration was supposed to finalize the new rules by the end of March in order for the softer requirements to take effect by the 2021 model year, but some automakers and officials have questioned if it will meet that deadline.\n\nMost automakers oppose freezing the requirements but also want relief from standards approved during the Obama administration that called for a roughly 5 percent annual reduction in carbon emissions - targets that translate to fuel

Hence, when there is no RIC clash we use the mnemonic code as RIC root. However, we do not change old RICs. Instead we have created an alias RIC pointing on the main RIC.

It is a wholesaler of news \u2013 in the form of text stories, photographs and video footage \u2013 to the media industry. Clients pay a subscription which entitles them to use Reuters news stories, pictures or video footage in their papers, magazines, websites or news bulletins.\n\nOpen any major daily newspaper and you will see that much of the news, particularly international or \u2018foreign\u2019 news, comes from agencies such as Reuters. This is because most papers only have a handful of journalists based in countries other than the one they publish in. Agencies, however, have large networks of correspondents, photographers and cameramen around the world.\n\nInternational news agencies tend to focus on the major stories of any country \u2013 those that are likely to be of interest beyond that country\u2019s boundaries. Reuters covers the main political and economic news from all the countries it is based in, as well as some that it isn\u2019t allowed to operate from such as Iraq and Angola. It also covers financial news about the leading companies of a country, its stock market and its local currency. The rest of its news output consists of coverage of major sports around the world such as football, tennis and golf; major disasters ranging from train crashes to volcanic eruptions; and stories about bizarre events.\n\nThe sources of an agency\u2019s news coverage varies widely. Every office compiles a comprehensive diary of routine events that have to be covered: a government minister\u2019s speech, the publication an economic indicator such as inflation data, or a major company\u2019s annual general meeting. Unexpected news about both politics and finance will often come from a tip off from a good contact or source, be a trader at the local stock exchange or the aide to a politician. News about local disasters often come from the local media, often TV, or from eyewitness reports.\n\nWhatever medium the journalist is working in \u2013 text, pictures or video \u2013 he or she needs to check their facts. If it\u2019s a text story the journalist will ring the subject of a story and ask for an official comment. They will probably ring a few experts to get their opinions \u2013 unlike newspapers, agencies never give their spin to a story, their job is to report the facts and the reaction to them. Both photographers and cameramen also have to check their facts so they can write the accompanying caption or script to go with their photos or video footage.\n\nBefore the news is transmitted to clients it is checked by an editor to ensure the facts are correct and that it doesn\u2019t conflict with anything already published by the agency on that story. Unlike newspapers there is no need to cut the story or crop the picture to fit it to a page. The whole story or complete picture is published to the clients who then choose how much or how little of it to use. For the same reason, very few stories are spiked (never published) by an agency.\n\nDeadlines don\u2019t exist at agencies and you write the story or produce the pictures or video as soon as you can after an event. For that reason, and because we are based in so many countries around the world, there\u2019s a steady stream of news pouring through Reuters 24 hours a day, seven days a week."}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/203039183-Copyrights-and-Reprints", "text": ""}, {"source": "reuters", "url": "http://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215713683-What-is-Reuters-policy-regarding-Privacy-Data-protection-", "text": "This can be found at Reuters home page - in the privacy footer.
