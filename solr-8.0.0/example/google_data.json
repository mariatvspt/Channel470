AP's Eric Tucker provides a debrief of the hearing. (Jan. 29) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A federal judge on Thursday ordered Roger Stone, the flamboyant political consultant charged with obstruction and lying to Congress, to stop talking about his case after he posted a picture of the judge on Instagram as part of a fundraising appeal.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had previously allowed Stone, an author who discusses politics on television, radio and the internet, to continue speaking so long as he didn't do so around the courthouse. She had ordered lawyers and witnesses not to discuss the case.\n\nJackson's stricter restrictions came after Stone posted a picture of the judge Monday next to what appeared to be a gun\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nJackson said Stone made his living through messages, so that she didn\u2019t believe the picture was chosen at random. She said the image could have stoked an angry crowd to violence.\n\n\u201cMr. Stone couldn\u2019t even keep his story straight on the stand,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow.\" She added: \"There's nothing ambiguous about crosshairs.\"\n\nJackson said her rules are designed to prevent the case from degenerating into a circus.\n\n\u201cThe publicity can\u2019t possibly subside if the defendant is out there fanning the flames,\u201d Jackson said as Stone leaned his head on his right fist. \u201cI have serious doubts about whether you\u2019ve learned any lesson at all.\u201d\n\nStone formally apologized for the \"improper\" post in a court filing Monday and repeatedly did so again Thursday while testifying under oath.\n\n\"I believe I abused the order,\" Stone said. \"I\u2019m kicking myself over my own stupidity, but not more than my wife is kicking me.\"\n\nStone, an off-and-on adviser to President Donald Trump, is charged by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team with obstruction and lying to Congress for statements about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released damaging emails about Democrat Hillary Clinton before the 2016 election. Stone was released on personal recognizance after he was arrested at his Florida home last month.\n\nStone has pleaded not guilty and said any misstatements were mistaken recollections rather than intentional lying. He has insisted he is innocent and attacked prosecutors on both social media and through television interviews.\n\nIn setting the hearing, Jackson also warned she could revoke Stone\u2019s release before trial. She didn't do that, but warned that she might if he violates her gag order.\n\nAt one point, Jackson asked whether Stone knew how to search with Google.\n\n\u201cHow hard was it to come up with a photograph that didn\u2019t have crosshairs in the corner?\" Jackson asked.\n\nStone said the image was chosen by one of five volunteers he couldn't specify because nobody would acknowledge giving it to him, but that he selected the picture from a couple of choices and posted it. Stone said he later studied the image and determined that it featured a Celtic occult sign rather than a gun's crosshairs.\n\n\"It was an error, your honor,\" Stone said. \"Nobody will own up to it,\" he said of his volunteers.\n\nOne of the prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis, asked for restrictions on Stone's speaking outside court.\n\nStone's lawyer, Bruce Rogow, opposed greater restrictions. Stone testified that his consulting has dried up, leaving it difficult for him to put food on the table and pay the rent.\n\nRogow said the posting was the only mistake Stone had made under pretrial release, and that he posed no threat of fleeing the charges or danger to the community.\n\n\"Really what he\u2019s asking for is a second chance,\" Rogow said. \"It was completely inappropriate. It\u2019s indefensible.\"\n\nRogow had suggested that if Jackson did restrict Stone's speech, the restrictions should apply to talking about the charges, the prosecutors and the judge.\n\n\u201cIt was outrageous to see that picture, to see that text,\" Rogow said. \u201cThe government should not be criticized by Mr. Stone.\"\n\nThe Instagram post featured text pleading for contributions to his legal defense fund and noted that Jackson had been appointed by former President Barack Obama. Stone said the post had been a random picture taken from the internet and wasn't meant to threaten or disrespect the judge.\n\n\u201cPlease inform the court that the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted,\u201d Stone wrote in a note filed with the court Monday. \u201cI had no intention of disrespecting the court and humbly apologize to the court for the transgression.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service, which protects federal judges, was aware of Stone's post, spokesman Drew Wade said on Tuesday. He declined to comment on whether the service had provided additional security to Jackson.\n\nMore: Trump adviser Roger Stone pleads not guilty in Russia inquiry as he takes on a new role as defendant\n\nMore: Judge says Roger Stone can keep talking about his criminal case, but not on the courthouse steps\n\nMore: Roger Stone denies using Instagram post to threaten federal judge presiding over his case\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/judge-roger-stone-stop-talking-federal-case/2938729002/"}, {"source": "google", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/politics/national-emergency-resolution-castro-donald-trump-mcconnell/index.html", "text": "(CNN) Mitch McConnell's life is about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nAs soon as Friday, the Democratic-controlled House will vote on a privileged resolution to terminate President Donald Trump's invocation of the National Emergencies Act to secure funding to build a wall on the country's southern border.

Many Venezuelans have flocked to the state as the country\u2019s economy crashed and repression increased.\n\nDemocrats, already alarmed that Trump\u2019s inroads with Venezuelans could help him peel off an otherwise-reliable Democratic voting bloc in a toss-up state, were quick to denounce Sanders\u2019 comments.\n\nFlorida Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on what's hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

He has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation,\u201d Rep. Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles and, told POLITICO. \u201cI absolutely disagree with his imprecision in not saying Maduro must go.\u201d Shalala has filed legislation aimed at helping Venezuelan immigrants.\n\nThe emerging issue hasn\u2019t yet spilled into the broader Democratic primary for president. Most candidates haven\u2019t weighed in, some by choice.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former Vice President Joe Biden, however, have clearly stated they consider Maduro a dictator and Guaid\u00f3 the legitimate leader of Venezuela. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren told Pod Save America that she believed Maduro was a dictator and suggested she supported the \u201cdiplomatic part\u201d of Trump\u2019s backing of Guaid\u00f3, though she faulted him for too much \u201csaber rattling.\u201d\n\nOne Democratic Hispanic consultant said the remarks will cause a needless \u201cfrenzy\u201d in South Florida\u2019s Hispanic community.\n\nSanders did not embrace Maduro in his Tuesday interview with Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, who quickly touched on Guaid\u00f3 being declared the interim president of Venezuela by the nation\u2019s National Assembly following Maduro\u2019s questionable election.\n\nBut when he was asked whether he recognized Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate leader of the country, Sanders answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\"There are serious questions about the recent election. There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election,\" Sanders added.\n\nIn a follow-up question, Ramos asked Sanders if he thought Maduro is a dictator who should step down. Sanders refused to say yes or no.\n\n\"I think clearly he has been very, very abusive,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cThat is a decision of the Venezuelan people, so I think, Jorge, there's got to be a free and fair election. But what must not happen is that the United States must not use military force and intervene again as it has done in the past in Latin America, as you recall, whether it was Chile or Brazil or the Dominican Republic or Guatemala.\u201d\n\nSanders also said that he believes \u201cthe United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThat comment puzzled Shalala. \u201cI do agree the international comm needs to come together and the U.S. needs to work with the international community,\" she said. \"But that\u2019s been happening.\u201d\n\nAfter Shalala posted her disagreement with Sanders on Twitter, the Vermont senator\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Ari Rabin-Havt, replied to her that \u201cthis view represents the long and horrific history of American politicians imposing their will on the people of Latin America. Bernie stands with the Venezuelan people to demand free and fair elections and for self-determination for all people around the world.\u201d\n\nRabin-Havt also noted Sanders has condemned Maduro.\n\nThe United States was the first to recognize Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s leader last month. About 64 other nations have followed. However, the United Nations still recognizes Maduro, though it has called for talks, as roughly 50 countries side with him \u2014 including U.S. foes Cuba, China, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia and Syria.\n\nSanders has long had sympathy for leftist governments. Once a self-described socialist \u2014 he now uses the term \"democratic socialist\" \u2014 Sanders has spoken favorably in the past about socialist and communist strongmen. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Sanders once said, wasn't \"perfect\" but \"totally transformed\" the country. And Nicaragua\u2019s leftist leader, Daniel Ortega, was \"an impressive guy,\" Sanders argued.\n\nOver the decades, Miami has become a home for exiles from some of those leftist governments, with Cuban-Americans leading the way and leaning strongly Republican. Venezuelans and Nicaraguans tend to vote Democratic once they become U.S. citizens and register to vote in Florida.\n\nBut Democratic consultants and community leaders say there\u2019s evidence that could change and that the GOP\u2019s anti-socialist messaging helped Republicans in 2018 and could help Trump in 2020.\n\nHelena Poleo, a Democrat who\u2019s a former journalist from Venezuela and is a Spanish-language commentator, called Sanders comments \u201cdisgusting. The Florida Democratic Party needs to denounce this now.\u201d\n\nThe state party made its position on Maduro clear, without mentioning Sanders by name.\n\n\u201cFlorida Democrats have been unequivocal: We recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the President of Venezuela, denounce the legitimacy of the Maduro regime and his efforts to remain illegally in power,\" the party said in a statement. Its comments echoed those of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who represents one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the United States.\n\nState Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Miami Democrat, said she was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d and believed Sanders wasn\u2019t properly briefed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously clueless,\u201d Taddeo said.\n\n\u201cSeems the Senator has already written Florida off his presidential campaign strategy,\u201d deadpanned Ric Herrero with the Cuba Study Group, which advocates for more engagement with Havana, an incidental ally of Caracas.\n\nOne of the state\u2019s top Democratic consultants for Hispanic outreach, former state party political director Christian Ulvert, said he was disappointed with Sanders for making such \u201cextremely ignorant\u201d comments. Ulvert, who\u2019s of Nicaraguan descent, said he found Sanders\u2019 comments harmful on a personal level as did his husband, who\u2019s from Venezuela and has relatives suffering under Maduro.\n\nThe day before Sanders\u2019 comments aired on Al Punto, Ulvert had written to the Democratic National Committee chairman concerning the location of the party\u2019s 2020 presidential convention and noted that Trump was trying to make inroads based on his anti-socialism message. Ulvert said \u201ceveryone in our party from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Joe Biden have recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the acting leader of Venezuela and said Maduro must go,\u201d and now Sanders is complicating that message.\n\n\u201cThis helps Trump and it makes our job harder as Democrats,\u201d Ulvert said. \u201cWhat this will do is whip into a frenzy South Florida\u2019s Hispanic community on both sides of the aisle. It\u2019s an unnecessary distraction.\u201d\n\n"}, {"source": "google", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-21/eu-is-said-to-expect-may-to-request-three-month-delay-to-brexit", "text": "Why did this happen?\n\nPlease make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading.

Zillow co-founder and former CEO Rich Burton will return to lead the company and Rascoff will remain on the board of directors.\n\nThe announcement coincided with the company's tepid earnings. Though the company beat on revenue, earning $365 million vs. the estimated $351 million, earnings per share were in line with estimates at 1 cent. Zillow did issue strong first-quarter guidance: between $417 and $443 million in revenue, vs. the estimated $404 million. The stock later gained back most of its loses after hours.\n\nShares of Kraft Heinz tumbled more than 10 percent after the market close Thursday following weak fourth-quarter results and the disclosure of an SEC subpoena. Kraft reported earnings per share of 84 cents on revenues of $6.89 billion. Analysts forecast earnings per share of 94 cents on revenues of $6.93 billion. The company also disclosed it was subpoenaed by the SEC in October 2018 regarding its accounting policies.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise shares shot up as much as 4 percent after the market close following the release of the software company's mixed first-quarter results. Earnings per share were 42 cents, beating Wall Street expectations of 35 cents. But HP Enterprise missed on its top line, posting $7.55 billion in revenue versus $7.6 billion forecast by Refinitiv.\n\nHP Enterprise sees full-year 2019 earnings per share between $1.56 and $1.66, vs. the estimated $1.58.\n\nDropbox shares rose slightly and then fell more than 8 percent after hours Thursday after posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings but also giving disappointing guidance. The software company beat on the top and bottom lines, reporting revenues of $376 million, compared to the Refinitiv estimate of $370 million. Adjusted earnings per share were 10 cents, versus the 8 cents forecast by analysts. Paying users reached 12.7 million, beating the expected 12.54 million. Average revenue per user increased to $119.61, vs. the forecast $118.48.\n\nShares of Roku surged as much as 6 percent in extended trading Thursday following the release of their better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. The digital media player manufacturer posted earnings per share of 5 cents on revenues of $276 million. Wall Street forecast earnings per share of 3 cents on revenue of $262 million, according to Refinitiv.\n\nFirst Solar shares dropped more than 4 percent in after hours trading Thursday after the release of the semiconductor manufacturing company's fourth-quarter earnings. First Solar earned $691 million in revenue, missing Refinitiv estimates of $804 million.

Testing will start with the 2019 Ford Ranger small pickup truck, and if problems are found, the company will start looking at models dating to 2017.\n\nFord says it has no evidence yet that mileage or pollution numbers are wrong, but the investigation has just started. The company says it's too early to tell how many and which models might be involved.\n\n2019 FORD RANGER TEST DRIVE\n\nDepending on what is found, Ford could be required to restate the mileage on EPA-approved window stickers as well as reimburse owners for the mileage difference. The company could also face penalties from the government agencies.\n\n\"At Ford, we believe that trust in our brand is earned by acting with integrity and transparency,\" Kim Pittel, the company's vice president for environment and safety engineering, said Thursday. \"We have a process for looking at how we perform and behave in our broad and complex company.\"\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, which monitor emissions and mileage, have been informed of the probe, according to the company.\n\nThe EPA said in a statement that Ford disclosed the issues on Tuesday.\n\n\"The investigation is ongoing and the information is too incomplete for EPA to reach any conclusions,\" the agency said. \"We take the potential issues seriously and are following up with the company to fully understand the circumstances behind this disclosure.\"\n\nThe problems do not involve \"defeat device\" software that activates pollution controls for emissions tests and turns them off on the road, according to Ford. For years, Volkswagen used a defeat device to cheat on diesel emissions tests until they were caught by university researchers and a nonprofit organization. Ford said the investigation is focused on vehicles with gasoline engines.\n\nIn an interview, Pittel said it's too early to tell how widespread the problem is or if it goes beyond 2017 models. \"We're just going to go where the investigation takes us,\" she said. \"We will be very, very thorough.\"\n\nMost emissions and mileage tests are done by automakers and spot-checked for accuracy by the EPA and California. The tests are done on a dynamometer, which is a treadmill-like device, and the mathematical model makes calculations for \"road load,\" which is drag from wind, tire rolling resistance, drag from engine-driven devices and other factors.\n\n\"We have identified potential concerns with how we calculate road load,\" Pittel said.\n\nIf problems are found, it won't be the first time Ford has had to restate mileage. In 2014, the Dearborn, Michigan, company had to cut the window sticker mileage on six models, and had to pay thousands of dollars to more than 200,000 owners after errors were discovered in how the mileage was calculated. The company said the latest issues are unrelated to the 2014 problems. The company also had to restate mileage on the C-Max gas-electric hybrid in 2013.\n\nThe Ford cases came after a 2012 EPA investigation found inflated mileage on 13 Hyundai and Kia models, affecting 900,000 vehicles."}, {"source": "google", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696597381/apple-and-goldman-sachs-will-reportedly-launch-an-iphone-connected-credit-card", "text": "Apple And Goldman Sachs Will Reportedly Launch An iPhone-Connected Credit Card\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nApple will reportedly have a different kind of product launch later this year: a credit card, jointly operated by Goldman Sachs.\n\nAccording to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the card will be integrated with the iPhone and offer features to track spending and points. The card would represent a move into new, highly competitive terrain for both companies.\n\nRather than competing with other credit cards offering lots of points, the Apple and Goldman Sachs card may try to attract users with features that emphasize budget management. \"Executives have discussed borrowing visual cues from Apple's fitness-tracking app, where 'rings' close as users hit daily exercise targets, and sending users notifications about their spending habits,\" the Journal reports.\n\nApple's move to get a share of the credit card market would be amid a slide in iPhone sales, particularly in China. Last month, the technology company said that its iPhone revenue declined 15 percent from the previous year.\n\nBut its services business has been growing. In its most recent earnings report, Apple trumpeted that services revenue hit $10.9 billion, an all-time high.

But that doesn't mean you should hop on the bandwagon now.\n\nSamsung on Wednesday finally offered a longer, closer look at the Galaxy Fold, a smartphone that unfolds like a book to reveal a second, larger display. It's the stuff of sci-fi magic, and it opens the door to a whole new world of different designs and devices. Most notably, it leaves Apple's iPhone franchise, which hasn't had a major facelift in more than a year, in the dust.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Samsung flaunts Galaxy Fold at Unpacked\n\nThe Galaxy Fold may be impressive, but there might not be a more perfect illustration of the hazards of being an early adopter. Credit goes to Samsung for getting a foldable phone to market before rivals, but it's clear from our short first look at the device that a lot more polish and development needs to happen before this is ready for the average consumer. After all, the gadget was actually show on stage for a few minutes and wasn't available for demos despite Unpacked being the phone's launch event.\n\n\"The Galaxy Fold is not intended to be a mass-market product, at least not yet,\" said Avi Greengart, an analyst at Techsponential. \"It's a halo product for Samsung, aimed at early adopters.\"\n\nIndeed, hard-core Samsung and gadget enthusiasts will gladly line up to be the first to own this device. They'll be beta testers in this brand-new foldable adventure.\n\nSamsung knows this, which is why its safer Galaxy S10 line, alongside a Plus, 5G and budget variants, served as the meat of the Unpacked event. For most consumers, these devices will be more than sufficient for their needs.\n\nBut if you're thinking about the Galaxy Fold, here are a few reasons why you should reconsider.\n\nPrice\n\nYou think the $1,099 starting price of the iPhone XS Max is expensive? The Galaxy Fold will launch on April 26 at a staggering $1,980.\n\nNext to the Fold, the $899 Galaxy S10 and the bigger $999 Galaxy S10 Plus are practically bargains. Though they're decidedly more rigid.\n\nAt a time when prices for smartphones are higher than ever, the Galaxy Fold breaks new ground in terms of its potential to eat into your wallet.\n\nJustin Denison, marketing executive for Samsung, put it best: \"It's a one of a kind luxury device.\"\n\nRead: Mate X: Huawei's $2,600 foldable phone steps up to Galaxy Fold with three screens, four rear cameras, 5G\n\nUser interface\n\nSamsung has said it had to rethink the software and user interface to take advantage of the two displays. It's admirable the company took care in considering the new design, but Samsung has a mixed record when it comes to software.\n\nCNET\n\nThe early days of Touch Wiz were abysmal, and though the Samsung experience has come a long way, it still lacks the cleaner interfaces found on rival devices like Google's Pixel phones or OnePlus devices.\n\nWhat Samsung showed off Wednesday looked promising. The device will be able to run three apps at once, and the seamless flow between the smaller display and the larger one works well in the demos. But we won't know for sure till we get our hands on the gadget.\n\nGiven how niche this device will be, app support should be abysmal at first. Google said it would support foldable devices with its next Android update, but that won't come until the second half of the year. For now Samsung touted Google Maps and video from Netflix as examples of apps that'll take advantage of the larger screen.\n\nBattery\n\nWe won't know just how long the Galaxy Fold's battery lasts until we run proper tests, but the demands of not one, but two displays -- including a massive folding one -- don't bode well for the Galaxy Fold.\n\nSamsung seems to know this, and it touted the inclusion of two separate batteries running the device.\n\nSize\n\nThe downside of a foldable phone is, well, it folds. Two halves mean a device that's going to be thicker than even the bulkiest of smartphones. That comes at a time when phone makers are shaving millimeters off their devices and talking about sleek design.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold appears to be less bulky than the prototype Samsung showed off in November, but it's still easily twice as thick as your standard phone.\n\nSo just wait till you try to stuff it in the side pocket of your skinny jeans.\n\nJuan Garzon/CNET\n\nDurability\n\nThis one is the real x-factor. Samsung touted the proprietary articulated spine, as well as the coating on the glass that protects the foldable part from wear-and-tear damage. But even if Samsung has tested these phones, it's unclear just how durable they are.\n\nAlso, good luck dealing with the device if you've scratched or cracked the screen. You're not going to be able to bring this to any screen repair shop to get it fixed.\n\nCNET\n\nTo the foldable pioneers\n\nIf you're the type of person who needs to have the latest and greatest no matter what -- well, why are you even reading this story? Concerns like price and battery life probably aren't too critical, since this isn't likely your only phone.\n\n\"It will sell out and become a status symbol,\" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insight.\n\nSo, to those early adopters willing to brave the new world of foldable phones, eventually leading to more-polished products for the rest of us, I salute you.\n\nBut for now, I'll stick to my boring rectangular slab of glass and metal.\n\nFirst published Feb. 21, 5 a.m. PT.\n\n"}, {"source": "google", "url": "https://www.slashgear.com/apple-foldable-iphone-patent-bends-both-ways-20566617/", "text": "Apple foldable iPhone patent bends both ways\n\nNow that Samsung has finally announced the Galaxy Fold, including its April availability and whopping $2,000 price tag, others are sure to follow. We do have Huawei and Xiaomi ready to make a splash, not to mention Lenovo who has actually been teasing foldable prototypes for years now. Almost everyone is in, including, surprisingly, Apple. The company has patented quite a few ideas for its own foldable device, and this latest one that popped up just last week might be the oddest one yet.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold is aimed at users who want a larger screen than their smartphones could give them but don\u2019t want to carry a second device. That\u2019s why transforms from a skinny and tall phone to a rather small tablet and vice versa. Most foldable devices shown off by manufacturers seem to be of the same mind, but this Apple patent is clearly a class of its own.\n\nBased on LetsGoDigital\u2019s renders of that patent, Apple\u2019s idea is to take what seems to be a Plus-sized iPhone and fold it in half along the horizontal axis. In other words, fold it like a clamshell phone. But unlike similar clamshell-like foldable phone ideas, this is more about folding an iPhone in half rather than a device that unfolds to a longer or taller version of its self.\n\nIt gets even weirder. Apparently, Apple envisions that this foldable iPhone can also bend backward. Whether it can fold all the way back isn\u2019t noted but the idea is to offer a \u201ctent mode\u201d where two users can view different things on different sides of the same phone. It\u2019s pretty much like what convertible PCs like the Lenovo Yogas do, except on a tinier screen.\n\nWhether Apple\u2019s patent makes practical sense or not is probably not a problem. It is just a patent after all, and the diagrams included in it are too rough and too generic to be the final design. Suffice it say, it\u2019s too early to count Apple out from the foldable phone race, though it will probably take its time while watching the competition test the waters first."}, {"source": "google", "url": "https://kotaku.com/guild-wars-2-developer-arenanet-plans-for-mass-layoffs-1832799804", "text": "Photo: ArenaNet\n\nArenaNet, the studio behind the popular online games Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2, informed employees today that it is planning big layoffs, according to a person who is there.

More articles will be published this week.\n\nBEST PICTURE: \u201cRoma\u201d\n\n\u201cRoma\u201d has so much to say in a very simple way. A lot of people have overlooked the poeticism of the movie. When I watched it, it brought back a lot of memories of my childhood and the people who took care of me when I was a kid. And of the times I was in trouble and was comforted and having key milestones happen in life. I thought the film captured that in a very elegant way. Second place is \u201cBlacKkKlansman.\u201d Third place is \u201cGreen Book.\u201d\n\nBEST DIRECTOR: Alfonso Cuaron (\u201cRoma\u201d)\n\nHe\u2019s such an auteur, and it\u2019s a very personal vision. I really appreciated the understated simplicity of the film, but at the same time when you look at it, you see how much is in the frame for what he\u2019s doing there from total scratch. That was a brilliant accomplishment.\n\nBEST ACTRESS: Glenn Close (\u201cThe Wife\u201d)\n\nActress is easy for me, and it\u2019s Glenn Close. It\u2019s a combination of this performance and the body of work plus her stature as an actress. This is the right time for her to get the Oscar. It\u2019s also the understatement because this is someone who doesn\u2019t need dialogue to express emotion.\n\nBEST ACTOR: Bradley Cooper (\u201cA Star Is Born\u201d)\n\nThis was an agonizing decision, and when I went through the ballot I left that one open for a while because I was so undecided. In the end I went with Bradley Cooper and this is a surprise. I tend to be a spread-the-love type of voter, and I want to acknowledge him this year.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS: Amy Adams (\u201cVice\u201d)\n\nI\u2019m going for a long shot there but a personal favorite in Amy Adams because she is just so good. Even though she had limited screen time, she established how much of a force behind the man that she was.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR: Mahershala Ali (\u201cGreen Book\u201d)\n\nThis is also easier, and it\u2019s Mahershala. In this case, you see the range in his performance compared to his other work. He really steps into this role and has the effectiveness and at the same time an emotional arc, especially when he connects with Viggo at the end.\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY: Spike Lee, David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel, Kevin Willmott (\u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d)\n\nHe was taking a lot of story and compressing into a movie. He did a very effective job of really drawing you in and covering a lot of ground.\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY: Paul Schrader (\u201cFirst Reformed\u201d)\n\nAs a work of art, I thought it was very powerful and the film has kind of been lost in the mill. Ethan Hawke should have been nominated for Best Actor.

This, however, is the winter of 2018-19, and for a variety of reasons the free agent market isn't what it used to be. In Kimbrel's case, he's perhaps the most acute example of the fact that teams these days care about past performance only to the extent it forms future expectations.\n\nKimbrel, of course, enjoyed a legendary peak with the Braves. When he was traded to the Padres following the 2014 season, Kimbrel at the time boasted an absurd 1.43 career ERA with an even more absurd 476 strikeouts in 289 innings. Those lofty heights are almost certainly gone forevermore, but in 2017 with the Red Sox Kimbrel proved still capable of elite-level run prevention. Then came a far more mortal 2018 for the champion Sox ...\n\nView Profile Craig Kimbrel BOS \u2022 RP \u2022 46 ERA 2.74 K/9 13.9 WHIP .99 S 42 BS 5\n\nTo be sure, those bestowals are the envy of many a reliever, but that's not Maximum Kimbrel. In 62 1/3 innings, Kimbrel walked 31 batters, none of them intentional. He also allowed home runs and extra-base hits at career-worst rates. Much of Kimbrel's difficulties flowed from declining fastball velocity.\n\nKimbrel can still breathe fire, yes, but his average four-seamer velocity of 97.6 mph was his lowest mark since 2011. Probably as a result of his losing a tick or two, Kimbrel leaned on his breaking ball last season more than ever before. As a partial consequence of throwing that curve more than one-third of the time, Kimbrel worked in the zone less than ever before. On top of all that, Kimbrel's ground-ball percentage was well below his career norms.\n\nNow let's turn to FIP. In general terms, FIP, which stands for fielding-independent pitching, is what a pitcher's ERA should be if you emphasize what's most under the pitcher's control (i.e., strikeouts and walks) and correct for things like luck, defense and sequencing. It's a good indicator of a pitcher's underlying basic skills on the mound. Last season, Kimbrel authored an FIP of 3.13. While that's not bad in a vacuum, it's the worst mark of Kimbrel's career. Also, compare it to Kimbrel's pre-2018 career FIP of 1.80. That's indicative of a skills decline.\n\nThat's not all that surprising for a closer who's now on the wrong side of age 30 and who's already finished 449 games in his career. Count the postseason, and Kimbrel's thrown more than 9,000 pitches in his major-league career, many of them no doubt high-leverage and high-stress pitches. Now put all that knowledge against Kimbrel's reported ask of six years and nine figures earlier this offseason. Sure, that's just an initial bargaining point, but no team is going to give that to a closer in his thirties with underlying signs of degradation.\n\nThis, obviously, isn't to say Kimbrel is of no use. He still misses bats, and most projection systems tab him for an ERA in the high 2.00s to low 3.00s. That's not elite, but it's still good. Accept that he's probably going to decline further from here and focus on getting that worth from him at the front end of whatever contract he signs.\n\nReally, this isn't about the money -- any team can afford any free agent, provided there's anything resembling organizational will. This is about the possible notion that Kimbrel can still be a lockdown closer. He probably can't be that. Good, he can be with an understanding that at this stage of his career he probably gets a little less good each day."}, {"source": "google", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/02/21/nba-draft-eligible-age-limit-proposal-18-years-old/2942228002/", "text": "CLOSE What I'm Hearing: USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt has been talking with people across the league to see if the NBA will reduce its age limit. USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NBA has submitted to the National Basketball Players Association a formal proposal that will lower the draft-eligible age to 18 from 19, a person with knowledge of the proposal told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss discussions between the league and the union.\n\nThe NBPA and its executive director, Michele Roberts, planned to review the proposal Monday at a post-All-Star weekend meeting in the Bahamas.\n\nThe league and union have had informal discussions about lowering the age limit, and NBA commissioner Adam Silver is on record saying the current 19-year-old age limit is not working for the league or college basketball.\n\nThis is the first step in formal negotiations to lower the age limit by the 2022 draft. The issue is collectively bargained between the NBA and NBPA, and both sides need to agree to any rule change.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver during 2019 All-Star Weekend. (Photo: Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe timing of the proposal is coincidental in relation to Duke star Zion Williamson\u2019s injury, but his injury re-ignited the debate about one-and-done college players who may otherwise enter the draft after high school rather than spending a season in college and bypassing millions of dollars.\n\nOPINION: Don't blame NCAA after Williamson's injury\n\nOPINION: Williamson should never play another minute with Duke\n\nNIKE: Takes heat after Zion Williamson's shoe failure\n\nAt the July NBA owners\u2019 meeting, Silver told reporters: \u201cMy personal view is that we\u2019re ready to make that change. \u2026 When I\u2019ve weighed the pros and cons, given that Condoleezza Rice and her Commission (On College Basketball) has recommended to the NBA that those one-and-done players now come directly into the league, and in essence the college community is saying we do not want those players anymore. That sort of tips the scale in my mind that we should be taking a serious look at lowering our age to 18.\u201d\n\nWhy the 2022 draft? The league wants to give teams ample time to prepare for the change, and with the NBA submitting a proposal to the union now, it's clear it would prefer to reach an agreement, or at least a framework of the deal, in the next few months.\n\nAs is the case in CBA negotiations, obstacles remain. ESPN reported in October that the NBA wanted agents to provide medical reports on players and mandate attendance and some participation in the draft combine. That would give teams more information to make better selections in the draft. There is some pushback from agents to divulge information, but teams may not be willing to draft a player out of high school without a physical.\n\nBut the union is not opposed to lowering the age limit, and in July, NBPA executive director Michele Roberts told reporters, \u201cStay tuned \u2026 I suspect that we'll have some news in the next few months.\"\n\nBoth sides seem willing to get a deal done, and there is confidence it will get done.

But questions remain whether the impact alone drove the dinosaurs to extinction or if it merely finished the job started by a massive volcanic outburst happening in India.\n\nThe Deccan Traps cover an area of roughly a half-million square kilometers, and the eruptions that created them involved over a million cubic kilometers of rock. Immense eruptions like this have been blamed for mass extinctions in the past, as they pump lots of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere and cause a rapid seesaw of cooling and warming. And the Deccan Traps are no exception: people have argued that they were already killing the dinosaurs or had stressed ecosystems in a way that set the stage for a mass extinction. But not everyone has bought in to this idea, and some have suggested that the asteroid collision actually drove changes in the Deccan Traps eruptions.\n\nSorting all this out requires a better sense of the timing of the eruptions vs. when the impact and extinctions occurred. In today's issue of Science, two papers attempt to narrow down the timing. Unfortunately, their results don't entirely agree.\n\nWhat and when?\n\nBoth papers rely on radiometric dating, but the papers use different types, each with their own limitations. One of them looks at the decay of uranium that's trapped in zircons that form during volcanic activity. The strength of this method is that it's very precise. Its downside is that zircons form at high temperatures, which means the zircons are underground prior to eruptions rather than during the eruption itself. So they don't provide a precise date of the eruption.\n\nTo get around this issue, an Indian-Swiss-US team looked at huge amounts of zircons and linked their dates to their specific location in the series of eruptions that built the Deccan Traps. A statistical analysis then identified any outliers\u2014a younger zircon beneath an older layer, for example\u2014and took them into account to build a model of the most probable ages of different eruptions.\n\nThis suggested that the Deccan traps were built in pulses, with a large eruption occurring about 100,000 years before the asteroid impact. An even larger one took place almost immediately after.\n\nA second team, this one from India-UK-US, did argon dating. The gas only starts being trapped once a rock solidifies, so it essentially starts the timer during the eruption itself. The hassle is that the gas can sometimes escape from the rock slowly over time, which is less of a problem with zircons.\n\nOverall, this group finds a big picture that overlaps with that of the group that did zircon dating. But there are differences in the details, and some of them are significant. For example, the researchers also find that the Deccan Trap eruptions overlapped with the mass extinction, occurring both before and after the event. But they see no evidence of pulses; instead, they see nearly continuous eruptions. Most of the material (~75 percent), they argue, was put in place after the mass extinction, though.\n\nThe researchers' dates are also consistent with a major shift in the properties of the erupted rock occurring at the same time as the impact. This supports the idea that the impact's seismic effects reached across the entire planet.\n\nEruptions like this release massive quantities of sulfur and carbon dioxide. These have opposing effects. The sulfur forms aerosols that reflect a huge amount of sunlight, causing a cooling. That cooling, however, is short term, as the aerosols don't have a long lifetime in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide does, and it produces a follow-on warming through the greenhouse effect. This climate seesaw is thought to have contributed to some mass extinctions.\n\nThe second paper includes an analysis that correlates the eruptions with signs of the climate change, but it finds they don't line up well. The authors conclude that either something else was going on with the climate, or the release of gasses doesn't always line up with the volume of lava erupted. So that result raises questions about how much the Deccan eruptions would have contributed to ecological disruptions.\n\nOverall, it seems that we have a lot more information, but it isn't necessarily leading to a clearer picture. The results do confirm that significant eruptions were happening before the mass extinction, but the biggest of them seemed to be happening after, and the eruptions' effect on distant ecosystems is unclear. And we don't know whether the eruptions were a small series of enormous outbursts or a relatively steady drumbeat of smaller events.\n\nThe good news is that if you're a fan of dinosaurs and want to know how they met their end, there's still science to be done.\n\nScience, 2019.

Materially, everything is the best it\u2019s ever been\u2014we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked\u2014the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn\u2019t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it\u2019s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn\u2019t\u2014and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the \u201csubtle art\u201d of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.\n\nNow, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom\u2014and even of hope itself.\n\nWith his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven\u2019t considered before. It\u2019s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come."}, {"source": "google", "url": "https://play.google.com/store/audiobooks/details/Gary_John_Bishop_Unfu_k_Yourself?id=AQAAAADER0JHlM", "text": "From the author of the New York Times and international bestseller Unfu*k Yourself Gary John Bishop presents a no-holds-barred guide to breaking through our cycles of self-sabotage to get what we want out of life.\n\nIn Unfu*k Yourself, Gary John Bishop told us it was time to stop making excuses\u2014to recognize and take responsibility for the negative self-talk holding us back.\n\nIn Stop Doing That Sh*t, he builds on that message, teaching us how to stop self-sabotaging behavior. Bishop explains how our destructive cycles come down to the way that we\u2019re wired. He then identifies different types of people and the ways we fu*k ourselves over: We can\u2019t save money.
