Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, was arrested on charges of firearm and drug possession, but Judge Charles Day said that Hasson\u2019s internet search history, as well as previous letters and emails he had allegedly written, were enough to warrant him a danger to the community.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the prosecution, Jennifer Sykes said that the gun and drug possession charges were \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d in terms of the extent of Hasson\u2019s alleged crimes, indicating that they may attempt to charge him as a domestic terrorist allegedly planning to launch a major attack.\n\n(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) U.S. Attorney Robert Hur, center, speaks while flanked by FBI Special Agent Gordon Johnson, right, and Art Walker, of the Coast Guard Investigative Service, after a hearing at the United States District Court Greenbelt Division, Feb. 21, 2019, in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nAccording to court documents filed Tuesday, Hasson was described as someone who had \"espoused extremist views for years.\" In a draft email from June 2017 he allegedly wrote, \"I am dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth. I think a plague would be most successful but how do I acquire the needed/ Spanish flu, botulism, anthrax not sure yet but will find something.\"\n\nHe was found to have been studying the writings of previous domestic terrorists and was particularly interested in that of Anders Behring Breivik, a Norwegian terrorist who killed 77 people in 2011, prosecutors alleged.\n\nThe defendant also allegedly compiled a list of prominent Democratic lawmakers as well as journalists from CNN and MSNBC. Names on that list include presidential candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, as well as MSNBC host Joe Scarborough and CNN's Van Jones.\n\nThe documents further showed that since 2017 Hassan had compiled 15 weapons, some of which had the capacity for extra magazines, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition. The weapons were found in his home in Silver Spring, which prosecutors say he had been leasing since 2016. Investigators also found over 30 bottles of HGH, human growth hormone, which followed Breivik\u2019s recommendations to bulk up in order to maximize one\u2019s physical strength during an attack.\n\n(Source) U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Paul Hasson was allegedly stockpiling weapons as he sought to launch a major attack, authorities said. Feb. 20, 2019.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Hasson was serving in the Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington, D.C., and had served in that position since 2016. Hasson also served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1988 to 1993 and spent two additional years in the mid-nineties in the National Guard, records showed.\n\nSykes also revealed that there was video showing Hasson taking those controlled substances while at work.\n\nHasson\u2019s attorney, Julie Stelzig, sought to characterize the prosecution\u2019s argument as overblown, calling it \"histrionic.\"\n\n\"These are very serious words,\" Stelzig said of the prosecution\u2019s claims that Hasson intended to murder innocent civilians. \"Even more extraordinary was the lack of actual substance backing up the assertions.\"\n\nStelzig also accused the government of submitting the court filing \"in order to bring enormous media attention to the case\" and convince the judge that Hasson should be detained and not released.\n\nThe defense noted that the charges Hasson was actually facing -- possession of a firearm as either an addict or an unlawful user of a controlled substance, and a misdemeanor possession of the synthetic opioid painkiller tramadol, were charges that did not carry the presumption of detention, meaning that the prosecution had the burden of convincing the judge that he deserved to be detained.\n\nStelzig downplayed Hasson's alleged stockpile of 15 guns and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, which were presented as evidence during the case.\n\n\"I can assure Your Honor that there are people in many parts of this country with whom this collection of guns would be modest at best,\" Stelzig said.\n\nShe told the judge Hasson's search history did not reflect that of someone intent on committing an act of terrorism, arguing that he had not gathered home addresses for any of the public officials he had listed.\n\n\"We are not yet a country that criminalizes people for their thoughts. Even their darkest thoughts,\" Stelzig said. \"We are not yet a country that detains people for their internet searches.\"\n\nDay based his decision on four factors: the circumstances of the offense charged, the weight of the evidence, some ancillary factors including his otherwise spotless record and service to the nation as a Marine veteran and member of the Coast Guard and National Guard, and the presumption of innocence relative to the government\u2019s assertion that his internet searches show him to be a danger to the community, \"which is where the government is laying its hat,\" he said.\n\nThe judge said both the prosecution and defense had made strong arguments but that he took issue with the defense\u2019s suggestion that the prosecution had filed a motion for detention in order to \"drum up media interest and potentially to influence this court.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know about the former but I can assure you the second is not accurate,\" the judge said.\n\nHe said his ruling -- that Hasson should remain in federal custody for at least 14 days -- came with a \"caveat\" that after those fourteen days, if the prosecution has not yet charged Hasson with any of the other criminal activity they alluded to today, Hasson\u2019s defense would be allowed to return to court and argue again for his release."}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/high-stakes-trade-talks-china-underway-white-house/story?id=61213054", "text": "Top U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators met on Thursday at the White House as they faced a March 1 deadline to end a seven-month trade war.\n\nNegotiations were led by U.S. Trade Amb. Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. The teams did not comment as they sat across from each other at a long table in the Indian Treaty Room. Lighthizer was joined for the high-stakes talks by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow as well as other officials.\n\nThe clock is ticking for negotiators to strike a deal before 90-day deadline set in December by President Donald Trump with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina that would result in U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods rising from 10 to 25 percent. The longstanding trade tit-for-tat disrupted international markets and stressed the American agricultural industry.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump struck an optimistic tone about talks with China and suggested the upcoming deadline is \u201cnot a magical date.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can't tell you exactly about timing, but the date is not a magical date. A lot of things can happen. The real question will be will we raise the tariffs,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cSo I know China would like not for that to happen. So I think they're trying to move fast so that doesn't happen. We'll see what happens.\u201d\n\nAs the meetings kicked off on Thursday, the president issued a warning to American companies: lead on 5G technology and development of the first mass-market 5G network or \"get left behind.\" His tweets indirectly referenced China.\n\nI want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard. American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind. There is no reason that we should be lagging behind on......... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019\n\n....something that is so obviously the future. I want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do, especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology! \u2014 Donald J.

If convicted of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report, the actor faces up to three years in prison.\n\nWhen first assistant state attorney Risa Lanier told Lyke that the actor had picked up two brothers who authorities say carried out the staged attack on him at his direction and showed them the location of where he wanted to be attacked, Smollett shook his head in disagreement.\n\nWhen Lyke told Smollett that the allegations, if true, are \"utterly outrageous,\" the actor nodded his head in agreement -- doing so again when Lyke said the noose detail would be the most despicable part of the alleged scheme.\n\nThe judge also ordered pre-trial monitoring of the actor, and ordered him to stay away from the two brothers he allegedly conspired with to stage the hoax attack, according to police.\n\nSmollett's next court appearance is scheduled for March 14.\n\nThe tense courtroom appearance followed on the heels of a morning press conference at which a visibly angry Johnson castigated the actor for betraying his race and his city with such an incendiary false claim.\n\n\"Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,\" a visibly angry Johnson said. \u201cI am left hanging my head asking \u2018why?\u2019. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? ... How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims?\"\n\nJohnson charged that Smollett, an actor on the hit show 'Empire' who has consistently denied any role in staging the alleged attack, orchestrated it because he was \"dissatisfied with his salary.\"\n\nIn addition to staging the attack, officials said, Smollett also sent himself a hate-filled letter to the Fox studio where the hit show is filmed.\n\nSmollett turned himself in at 5:15 a.m. local time and made a statement to police before being taken into custody. His lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, were not present at the time but they released a statement the night before.\n\n\"Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.\"\n\nThursday evening, the attorneys released a statement criticizing law enforcement's handling of the case.\n\n\"Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,\" the statement read. \"Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.\"\n\n(Invision/AP, FILE) Jussie Smollett attends an \"Empire\" event in Los Angeles, May 20, 2016.\n\nBacklash\n\nPolice add that Smollett gave no statement to police after turning himself in and that his lawyers had reached out to them Wednesday night to discuss his surrender. Smollett wanted to turn himself in near midnight, but authorities suggested he come in at 5 a.m. instead, to avoid spending the night in jail. Smollett arrived early Thursday morning accompanied by a female lawyer and an entourage of five or six people.\n\nSmollett was silent as he went through the motions of being booked and processed.\n\nBy late morning on Thursday, the backlash against the actor began at the top, with an angry tweet from the President of the United States.\n\n\".@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA\" President Donald Trump wrote in a tweet after the press conference.\n\n(FOX via Getty Images) The cast of \"Empire,\" Terrence Howard, Jussie Smollett, Bryshere Gray, Trai Byers and Taraji P.

There, spaceships with undercarriages resembling tribal masks soar over majestic waterfalls, touching down in a story that has far more going for it than branding.\"\n\nThe 2019 Oscars take place Sunday at 8 p.m. on ABC.\n\nBoth ABC News and Marvel, the studio behind \"Black Panther,\" are part of parent company Disney."}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/2019-oscars-13-historic-firsts-years-nominees/story?id=61166594", "text": "Whether it's a first-time winner's empowering speech or a celebrity's first time stepping out on the red carpet, movie fans can't seem to get enough of the \"firsts\" that take place at the Academy Awards.\n\nSeveral barrier-breaking milestones took place this year. Here are highlights among nominees and those who went on to win.\n\n1. 'Black Panther' the 1st superhero film nominated for best picture\n\n(Marvel Studios) Chadwick Boseman in a scene from the movie Black Panther.\n\nThe 2008 film \"The Dark Knight\" seemed like the great hope for the genre. After all, the late Heath Ledger did earn a best supporting actor award for his turn as The Joker. But the film failed to score a nomination for best picture.\n\n2. Hannah Beachler first African-American to be nominated and win best production design\n\nBeachler reportedly became the second person hired for Marvel's \"Black Panther\" after director Ryan Coogler. And it paid off, not only for the film's $700 million haul, but because she's Marvel's first female production designer and the first black production designer in the category. And now, she's also the first black winner in the category.\n\n3\u00b7 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is Marvel's 1st best nominee and winner for best animated feature\n\n\"Black Panther\" is breaking through for Marvel in the live-action arena, but the studio is also a force to contend with in animation as the acclaimed \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" became the first best animated feature nomination for Marvel -- and the studio's first winner.\n\n4. Lady Gaga 1st to be nominated for best actress, best song\n\nGaga could have a huge night at the Oscars thanks to her role as Ally in \"A Star is Born\" and for \"Shallow,\" the song she co-wrote for the film that she sings with co-star Bradley Cooper. To be fair, the path she walks isn't freshly paved: Mary J. Blige scored best supporting actress and best song nods for her respective performances in \"Mudbound.\"\n\n5. 1st time 2 directors nominated for both best foreign language film and best director\n\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \"Roma\" and Pawel Pawlikowski's \"Cold War\" together made history, but what would have been additionally historical is if either won best picture -- to date, no foreign language film ever has.\n\n6. Spike Lee earns his 1st nomination for best director\n\n(Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images) Spike Lee attends the \"Glass\" Premiere, Jan. 15, 2019, in New York.\n\nThough his career spans more than three decades, Lee only received his first best director nomination this year for \"BlacKkKlansman.\" It wouldn't be his first Oscar, though, as he took home an honorary award in 2016.\n\n7. 'BlacKkKlansman' is Spike Lee's 1st film nominated for best picture\n\n\"Do the Right Thing\" got Lee his first Oscar nod for best original screenplay in 1990, and \"4 Little Girls\" earned him a best documentary nomination in 1998. But up until this year, none of those or his dozens of other films reached the level of best picture consideration.\n\n8. Hulu gets 1st Oscar nomination in best documentary category for 'Minding the Gap'\n\nHulu gets into the Oscars game with Bing Liu's documentary, which followed Liu and two of his friends as they navigated growing up, family life and challenges to their friendship.\n\n9. 'Roma' is 1st Netflix film nominated for best picture\n\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n's critical masterpiece has been scoring film-of-the-year accolades throughout awards season. It isn't the first streaming flick to be nominated, though -- that honor goes to Amazon's \"Manchester by the Sea.\"\n\n10. Yalitza Aparicio, in 'Roma,' becomes 1st indigenous person from the Americas nominated for best actress\n\n(FilmMagic/Getty Images) Yalitza Aparicio attends the 76th annual Golden Globe awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, Jan. 6, 2019, in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nAparicio -- a teacher whose first major acting gig led to her nomination -- made headlines for being the first person with a Mexican indigenous background to be nominated for best actress. Keisha Castle-Hughes, who is of Maori indigenous descent, was the first ever nominated, for her role in \"Whale Rider.\"\n\n11. 1st time 2 Mexican-born women nominated for acting awards at same Oscars\n\n\"Roma's\" Yalitza Aparicio was born in Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, Mexico, while best supporting actress nominee Marina de Tavira, who also stars in \"Roma,\" was born in Mexico City.\n\n12.

He's now the first person to win both at the same ceremony.\n\nEven more history-makers\n\nSome other milestones took place during the Oscars broadcast on Sunday: \"Bao,\" Pixar's first short film directed by a woman, took the best animated short film honors, and Ruth Carter became the first black woman to win the award for best costume design, calling her accomplishment in her decades-long career \"surreal.\""}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/win-best-picture-maddeningly-close-race-61196089", "text": "On a year where one of the lead Oscar contenders is titled \"The Favourite,\" the 91st Academy Awards lack a clear front runner.\n\nNormally a fairly predictable process with one or two favorites, this year's best picture race has been maddeningly unclear, almost devious in its contradictions. The guild awards, usually a road map to the Oscars, have spread their honors around like never before. Not one of the top prizes from the leading guilds has lined up with another.\n\nThe producers went for \"Green Book,\" the directors chose \"Roma,\" the actors voted for \"Black Panther,\" the editors chose \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Favourite,\" the cinematographers elected \"Cold War\" and the writers picked \"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\" and \"Eighth Grade,\" a movie the academy snubbed entirely.\n\nThe inconsistency has befuddled onlookers. Variety called it \"uncharted territory.\" Deadline suggested it is \"one of the closest races in academy history.\"\n\nOscar balloting concluded Tuesday night. With days to go before show time Sunday, here's a rundown of the contenders and why each one has reason to hope.\n\nROMA\n\n(The Associated Press) This image released by Netflix shows Yalitza Aparicio, center, in a scene from the film \"Roma,\" by filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. The film is nominated for an Oscar for both best foreign language film and best picture. The 91st Academy Awards will be held on Sunday. (Carlos Somonte/Netflix via AP)\n\nMany think this is Netflix's Oscar to lose, and, boy, do they want to win it. Alfonso Cuaron's black-and-white drama has some major dings against it. Most notably it was entirely overlooked by the Screen Actors Guild. (All but two films in the last 20 years have needed a SAG ensemble nod to win best picture.) But it remains the critics' choice (both New York and Los Angeles critics groups named it best film), and it won at both the Directors Guild Awards and the BAFTAs. Its 10 nominations evidence widespread esteem for \"Roma,\" including two unexpected acting nods (Yalitza Aparacio, Marina de Tavira). Some prominent academy members ( like Steven Spielberg ) have said the Emmys are the proper place for Netflix films. But \"Roma,\" Netflix's first best-picture nominee, may have turned the tide. It would be doubly historic: \"Roma\" would be the first foreign-language best-picture winner.\n\nGREEN BOOK\n\n(Patti Perret/Universal Pictures) Mahershala Ali as Dr. Donald Shirley and Viggo Mortensen as Tony Vallelonga in \"Green Book,\" directed by Peter Farrelly.\n\nPeter Farrelly's interracial road trip drama seems to be the strongest challenger to \"Roma.\" It won at both the Golden Globes and the Producers Guild Awards , which, like the Oscars, use a preferential ballot. But no movie has been more dogged by criticism. While some see a snappy, feel-good buddy movie, others see an outdated and inauthentic set-up that trades on racial stereotypes. In a close race, can such a polarizing film win? \"Green Book,\" so often compared to 1989's best picture-winning \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" may be exactly the kind of movie that once won best picture. But the film academy's membership has in recent years diversified and grown more international .\n\nTHE FAVOURITE\n\n(Twentieth Century Fox) Olivia Colman in the film, \"The Favourite.\"\n\nYorgos Lanthimos' period romp comes tied with \"Roma\" for the most nominations and yet it has few assured wins. It won seven awards at the BAFTAs (where \"Roma\" ultimately took the top award). As a British period drama, \"The Favourite\" has the look of a traditional Oscar winner but gleefully inverts and subverts typical traits of the genre \u2014 making it kind of a perfect Academy Awards Trojan horse.\n\nBOHEMIAN RHAPSODY\n\n(The Associated Press) This image released by Twentieth Century Fox shows Rami Malek in a scene from \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" Malek is nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his role in the film. The 91st Academy Awards will be held on Sunday. (Alex Bailey/Twentieth Century Fox via AP)\n\nCritics don't like it . Some say it sanitizes Freddie Mercury's homosexuality. And its director, Bryan Singer, was fired mid-production and is now facing (and denying) numerous allegations of sexual misconduct . These are not the normal ingredients for a best-picture contender. And yet \"BoRhap\" abides. Not only that, Singer's biopic is a massive hit, especially abroad, with more than $850 million in ticket sales worldwide. It won not just best picture, drama, at the Globes , but took top honors at the ACE Eddie Awards as the best edited drama. Were \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to win, some would slam it as the worst best-picture winner ever. Fans would simply sing \"We Are the Champions.\"\n\nA STAR IS BORN\n\n(Warner Bros. Pictures) Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a scene from the movie, \"A Star is Born.\"\n\nSomething went amiss for the once-presumed front-runner. Bradley Cooper's remake (also a box-office hit with $423 million globally) has been nominated just about everywhere and yet has gone home with little, besides awards for its music. It still scored seven Oscar nominations, but not since 1934 has a movie without either a directing or editing nod won best picture. No amount of Cooper cameos at Lady Gaga concerts seems able to save it. Also not helping: only two remakes have ever won best picture: 1959's \"Ben-Hur\" and 2006's \"The Departed.\"\n\nBLACKKKLANSMAN\n\n(The Associated Press) This image released by Focus Features shows Adam Driver, left, and John David Washington in a scene from \"BlacKkKlansman.\" The film is nominated for an Oscar for best picture. The 91st Academy Awards will be held on Sunday. (David Lee/Focus Features via AP)\n\nSpike Lee's latest joint doesn't have a lot of big wins from the precursor awards, but it's the only movie nominated by every major guild. That speaks to a broad support that no other film can match. Many would also like to see Lee, who was given an honorary Oscar in 2015, win his first competitive Academy Award. Lee has called his film this year's dark horse, \"pun intended.\"\n\nBLACK PANTHER\n\n(The Associated Press) This image released by Disney shows a scene from Marvel Studios' \"Black Panther.\" The film is nominated for an Oscar for best picture. The 91st Academy Awards will be held on Sunday. (Matt Kennedy/Marvel Studios-Disney via AP)\n\nFirst the bad news. Only once before has a movie with no other major nominations won best picture, and that was \"Wings\" in 1927, when they were giving out two top awards (the other went to \"Sunrise\"). The academy tried to bring back that best-picture dichotomy for this Oscars, only to abandon plans for a best popular film category that \"Black Panther\" would have likely won. But Ryan Coogler's Marvel epic, the first superhero movie ever nominated for best picture, is unique in many ways. It's the year's biggest domestic hit with more than $700 million in North America where it was received as a cultural milestone. It also triumphed at the Screen Actors Guild Awards . A best-picture win wouldn't be the first time \"Black Panther\" made history.\n\nVICE\n\n(Matt Kennedy/Annapurna Pictures) Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney and Christian Bale as Dick Cheney in \"Vice.\"\n\nAdam McKay's Dick Cheney biopic probably has the longest odds of any of the eight nominees. But, then again, it does have nominations in all the big areas: acting (Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell), screenplay (McKay), directing (McKay) and editing (Hank Corwin). Only \"BlacKkKlansman\" and \"The Favourite\" can say the same.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor full coverage of the Oscars, visit: https://apnews.com/AcademyAwards"}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/trump-release-mueller-report-abroad-attorney-general-61194904", "text": "Transcript for Trump says release of Mueller report while he's abroad is up to attorney general\n\nThat'll be totally up to the new attorney general he's a tremendous man of tremendous.

One of the individuals charged, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, is reported to be an associate of Putin and is alleged to have funded the operation.\n\nThe Formal Charges: All of the defendants were charged with Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, and some faced additional charges.\n\nThe Alleged Crime: The indictment alleges that the defendants were involved in a conspiracy to create hundreds of fake personas online, pretending to be Americans, in order to stoke social, racial and political divides in the U.S. on web platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.\n\nThe special counsel said the IRA referred to the operation as \u201cinformation warfare.\u201d\n\nThe American operation was part of a larger initiative, known as Project Lakhta, which also targeted domestic and regional audiences and had a budget of over $1 million per month, the indictment says. At one point the American operation alone involved more than 80 IRA employees.\n\nSome workers at the IRA, referred to as \u201cspecialists,\u201d were \u201cdirected to create \u2018political intensity through supporting radical groups, users dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements,\u2019\u201d the indictment says.\n\nIn addition to generally divisive content, by mid-2016 the indictment says the Russians used the accounts to support the candidacy of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and to disparage then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nAt times they allegedly used the stolen identities of real Americans and pretended to be grassroots U.S. political organizations to stage political rallies inside the U.S. The special counsel alleges that some of the defendants traveled to the U.S. \u201cunder false pretenses\u201d for the purpose of collecting intelligence to support the influence operation and procured \u201ccomputer infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. to \u201chid the Russian origin of their activities.\u201d\n\nThe special counsel said that taken together, these purported activities amounted to defrauding the U.S. government by \u201cimpairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions\u201d of U.S. government departments including the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe Response: Of the 16 defendants, only one has opted to challenge the indictment in court: a Russian firm called Concord Management and Consulting, LLC. That firm, which prosecutors say is controlled by Prigozhin, is accused of helping to fund the influence operation and has pleaded not guilty. Through its American attorneys at the law firm Reed Smith, Concord has pursued a vigorous defense in pre-trial hearings."}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marianne-williamson-oprah-confidant-author-spiritual-teacher-presidential/story?id=60709204", "text": "Author, spiritual teacher and Oprah Winfrey confidant Marianne Williamson formally announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president in Los Angeles on Jan. 28.\n\nThis came after Williamson's six trips to Iowa and one to New Hampshire as she explored a bid.\n\n\"I want to engage voters in a more meaningful conversation about America,\" Williamson said in a campaign statement. \"About our history, about how each of us fit into it, and how to create a sustainable future.

Cummings\u2019 office has previously raised concerns that a consulting business Flynn once ran appeared to have a financial interest in the idea.\n\nNew testimony and documents collected by House investigators, summarized in Tuesday\u2019s interim staff report, suggest the plan still had support within the White House after Flynn was fired in February of 2017, ahead of his conviction for lying to federal agents about his talks with Russians.

He was scheduled to make his first court appearance on Friday.

One Ohio couple, who was not identified, gave Taub nearly $1.3 million of the more than $1.6 million he raised, according to the criminal information filed Feb. 12 by a prosecutor in the public integrity section of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nTaub used the money for expenses such as escorts, adult entertainment, cigars, clothes, hotels and plane tickets, prosecutors said. The scheme lasted from around December 2016 to as recently as November, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn July, the group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Taub and the Keeping America in Republican Control PAC.

In a foreboding sign Thursday, the IS claimed responsibility for back-to-back suicide attacks that hit a village miles away, leaving more than a dozen people dead in a rare targeting of civilians.\n\nA few hundred people \u2014 many of them women and terrified-looking children \u2014 were evacuated Wednesday from the group's tiny tent camp on the banks of the Euphrates River, signaling an imminent end to the territorial rule of the militants' self-declared \"caliphate\" that once stretched across a third of both Syria and Iraq.\n\nSome 300 IS militants, along with hundreds of civilians believed to be mostly their families, have been under siege for more than a week in the tent camp in the village of Baghouz. It wasn't clear how many civilians remain holed up inside, along with the militants.\n\nMore trucks were sent in Thursday to the tip of a corridor leading to the camp to evacuate more people, but Associated Press journalists on the ground outside Baghouz said no civilians emerged.\n\n\"We thought more civilians will come out today and we sent 50 trucks over,\" said an SDF commander who goes by his nom de guerre, Aram. \"We don't know why they are not coming out.\"\n\nAnother SDF official said IS militants closed the roads so the civilians could not come out, citing an absence of military pressure on the group as a possible reason.\n\nNearly 20,000 people left through a humanitarian corridor on foot from the IS holdout earlier this month but the militants closed the passage and no civilians left for a week until Wednesday. The presence of civilians and possibly senior members of the militant group in Baghouz have slowed the group's defeat.\n\nHundreds of women and children from Wednesday's evacuation could be seen in the middle of the desert on the way out of Baghouz, in what appeared to be a screening area in an open field. SDF fighters could be seen among them but journalists were not allowed to approach or film them. A large convoy of coalition vehicles, armored and vans, headed in their direction.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition declined to comment on the evacuation.\n\nThe issue of captured foreign fighters in Syria poses a major conundrum for European and other countries whose nationals have been imprisoned in Syria. The SDF is holding more than 900 foreign fighters in prisons it runs in the country's north, many of them Iraqis and Europeans.\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF \u2014 and more recently President Donald Trump \u2014 have called on these countries to take back their nationals. The SDF says it cannot afford to keep the captured foreigners in Syria, but few of their countries want them back.\n\nEarlier this month, Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi said Iraq will take back all Iraqi IS militants in Syria, as well as thousands of their family members.\n\nThe Iraqi security official, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the SDF are holding more than 20,000 Iraqis suspected of IS membership as well as their families in prisons and camps in northern Syria.\n\nAn Iraqi intelligence official said among those were around 500 Iraqi IS fighters, adding that these will be transferred back home in batches. The intelligence official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the first group of 150 was transferred to Iraqi authorities aboard 16 pickup trucks Wednesday night and that they have been moved to the capital Baghdad for interrogation.\n\nAn Alabama woman who joined IS in Syria also made headlines after the U.S. said Wednesday she won't be allowed to return with her toddler son because she is not an American citizen. Her lawyer is challenging that claim.\n\nThe 24-year-old Hoda Muthana has said she made a mistake and regrets aligning herself with IS. She is now in a refugee camp in Syria along with others who fled the militants.\n\nOn Thursday, back-to-back suicide car bombings in a market in Deir el-Zour province killed 14 civilians and an SDF fighter, a commander said.\n\nIS claimed responsibility through its Amaq news agency and said the attack targeted an SDF vehicle.\n\nAdnan Afrin, of the SDF, said the two blasts went off in the village of Shahil, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the al-Omar Oil Field base. He said two suicide bombers stopped their cars and detonated their explosives in the market.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported a car bomb that was detonated remotely as a convoy that includes workers and technicians who work at the oil field was passing. The Britain-based war monitor said 20 were killed and others wounded.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a French diplomatic official and an SDF official said they are trying to verify reports that Fabien Clain, a Frenchman who is one of Europe's most-wanted members of IS, was killed in an airstrike in Syria.\n\nClain is considered a key figure in the 2015 attacks in Paris, and it was his voice that claimed responsibility in the name of Islamic State for the deadly onslaught in his home country. Neither official would be named given the ongoing verifications in Baghouz, and a U.S. military spokesman said the coalition could not confirm the reports.\n\nThe Baghouz pocket's recapture by U.S.-backed Syrian fighters would spell the territorial defeat of IS and allow Trump to begin withdrawing American troops from northern Syria, as he has pledged to do, opening a new chapter in Syria's eight-year civil war.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed reporting."}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/strong-quake-hits-japans-northernmost-main-island-hokkaido-61209295", "text": "A strong earthquake shook a wide area of Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido on Thursday evening, but there were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries.\n\nThe quake hit the southwestern part of Hokkaido at a depth of about 30 kilometers (19 miles) and measured magnitude 5.8, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.

A judge had sentenced Timbs to probation and a modest $1,200 fee. Timbs\u2019 argued the subsequent seizure of his vehicle by Indiana was excessive and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe protection against excessive fines guards against abuses of government\u2019s punitive or criminal law-enforcement authority. This safeguard, we hold, is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, with deep roots in our history and tradition,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in the court\u2019s opinion.\n\n\u201cThe historical and logical case for concluding that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Excessive Fines Clause is overwhelming,\u201d she said.\n\n(Jenna Watson/IndyStar via USA Today Network, FILE) Tyson Timbs poses for a portrait at his aunt's home in Marion, Ind., Monday, Aug.13, 2018.\n\nThe impact of the decision could be significant, legal experts say, likely triggering action in states nationwide to move toward limits on civil asset forfeiture.\n\n\u201cInstead of simply saying you were transporting heroin and the state is seizing your vehicle, a state would now most likely have to go a little further and consider whether that seizure was excessive or prohibited under the Eighth Amendment. That would mean a hearing or evidentiary finding,\u201d said Christopher Riano, a lecturer in constitutional law at Columbia University.\n\nIn the 26 states and District of Columbia that report forfeiture activity, law enforcement agencies collected more than $254 million in funds and property in 2012 alone, according to an analysis by the Institute for Justice, a non-profit libertarian public interest law firm.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, our justice system has come to rely on fines, fees and forfeitures to fund law enforcement agencies rather than having to answer to elected officials for their budgets,\u201d said Scott Bullock, the president and general counsel of the Institute for Justice. \u201cWe are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court established that the U.S. Constitution secures meaningful protections for private property and limits the government\u2019s ability to turn law enforcement into revenue generators.\u201d\n\nThe decision also means Timbs will get his Land Rover back or compensation from the state for the comparable amount.\n\n\u201cTyson paid his debts to society,\u201d said Timbs' attorney Wesley Hottot. \u201cHe took responsibility for what he did. He paid fees. He is in drug treatment. He is holding down a job. He is staying clean. Our hope and goal now is to get back his vehicle from the police so Tyson will have an easier time getting to all the different commitments he has to stay on the straight and narrow.\u201d\n\nThe opinion by Ginsburg, which she read aloud from the bench, was her first since undergoing cancer surgery in December. It is also an indication that, as the court had said in the weeks before her return to the court Tuesday, Ginsburg continued to work from home during her recovery.\n\nIndiana had argued that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s excessive fines clause does not apply to so-called \u201cin rem\u201d forfeitures, or action targeting property \u2013 not an individual -- solely because of its role in criminal activity. The state argued that because Timbs used the Land Rover to buy drugs, the vehicle was a criminal tool.\n\nBut the court, citing precedent, disagreed, saying that such seizures are \u201cat least partially punitive\u201d against the individual and subject to constitutional limits.\n\n\u201cTaking my vehicle makes things unnecessarily difficult for a person like me, who already struggles. To me it doesn\u2019t make sense; if they\u2019re trying to rehabilitate and help me help myself, why do you want to make things harder by taking away the vehicle I need to meet with my parole officer or go to a drug recovery program or go to work?\" Timbs said in a statement after the Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"You need a car to do all these things. Forfeiture only makes it more challenging for people in my position to clean up and remain a contributing member of society,\" he said.\n\n(Al Drago/Reuters) The Supreme Court in Washington, Nov. 13, 2018.\n\nCivil asset forfeiture \u2013 the ability of authorities to seize private property used in a crime \u2013 has become a lucrative revenue source for states and a tool to exact punishment, in many cases without insomuch as a court hearing.\n\nFor decades, critics have panned the practice as \u201cpolicing for profit\u201d and an example of unchecked government overreach.\n\n\u201cThere can be no serious doubt that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the states to respect the freedom from excessive fines enshrined in the Eighth Amendment,\u201d wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in a concurring opinion.\n\nGorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas, while agreeing with the conclusion in the case, offered different reasoning. They said protection against excessive files was among the \u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the U.S.\u201d guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and that Indiana violated that privilege, not a \u201cdue process\u201d right.\n\n\u201cPetitioner argues that the forfeiture of his vehicle is an excessive punishment. He does not argue that the Indiana courts failed to proceed according to the law of the land\u2026 His claim has nothing to do with any process due him,\u201d Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion. \u201cI therefore decline to apply the legal fiction of substantive due process.\u201d"}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/scientists-discovered-zebras-stripes/story?id=61210554", "text": "Scientists believe they may have solved the mystery of why zebras have stripes.\n\nZebras likely evolved to have stripes in order to avert attacks from biting flies, a study, published Wednesday in the Public Library of Science ONE scientific journal, states.\n\nIn an experiment in which horses wore different patterned cloth coats, the horses wearing a striped pattern suffered far lower rates of flies landing on the coats than horses wearing a black or white coat, although there was no differences in the rate of attacks to the horses' naked heads, according to the study.\n\nResearchers examined the behavior of horse flies near captive zebras and uniformly colored horses and found that, although rates on the amount of time the flies spent circling the two different species did not differ -- fewer flies landed on zebras than horses.\n\n(Digital Camera Magazine via Getty Images, FILE) Close up detail of the black and white stripes on a Grevy's zebra photographed at the Marwell Zoo, Aug. 4, 2016.\n\n(University of Bristol/UC Davis via AP) Scientists from the University of Bristol and the University of California at Davis dressed horses in black-and-white Zebra type striped coats for part of their research.\n\n\"Taken together, these findings indicate that, up close, striped surfaces prevented flies from making a controlled landing but did not influence tabanid [fly] behaviour at a distance,\" according to the study.\n\n(Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images, FILE) Zebra are seen at the Amboseli National Park in Kenya, June 22, 2018.\n\nAlso, the acts of zebras swishing their tails and running away from flies resulted in \"very few flies\" landing on them or probing for blood, according to the study.\n\nHowever, the \"precise mechanism\" by which stripes avert attacks is unknown.\n\n(Ishara Kodikara/AFP/Getty Images, FILE) African zebra are pictured in their enclosure at a zoo in Dehiwala near the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo on March 3, 2016.\n\nMartin How, a research fellow at the University of Bristol who specializes in animal vision, told The Associated Press that researchers were trying to get their minds \"into the eye of the fly.\"\n\n\"They have very different eyes from us,\" How said.\n\nHow told AP that reasons to be \"quite excited\" about the new findings include broader implications in terms of technology.

But simply being proposed on Thursday by Paris for an Olympic debut in 2024 was hailed by breakers as a milestone that will boost breakdancing's global footprint and its acceptance as a bona fide competitive sport.\n\n\"It's a victory for us. Even if it goes no further, we'll still have won,\" said Mounir Biba, one of the foremost breakdancers in France, which is a stronghold of the sport.\n\nAlso on Paris' wish-list are climbing , surfing and skateboarding \u2014 which will all make their Olympic debuts at the 2020 Tokyo Games. The head of the Paris organizing committee, Tony Estanguet, announced the selection, disappointing other sports that lobbied for a spot, including karate and squash.\n\nParis' proposal is the four sports together enter 248 athletes, evenly split between men and women. Room would have to be made elsewhere in the program to stay within the IOC's ceiling of 10,500 Olympians in total.\n\nIn competitive breakdancing, also called breaking, breakers \u2014 alone or in teams \u2014 face off against each other in \"battles,\" taking turns to show off an array of imaginative, acrobatic and improvised moves to a DJ's beats, watched by a judging panel that picks the winner. Breaking featured at the Youth Olympic Games last year.\n\n\"There's simply no doubt about the athletic aspects of the discipline,\" said Biba, fielding numerous questions at the Paris announcement about how breaking qualifies as a sport.\n\n\"I defy Cristiano Ronaldo to do just one of my movements,\" he said.\n\nEstanguet said the 2024 organizing committee wants \"to connect the games to their era.\"\n\nOrganizers noted the proposed sports have broad appeal to young people, large and active audiences on social media and, with skateboarding and breaking in particular, an urban base. Another advantage for Paris as it seeks to satisfy IOC efforts for less wasteful games is the four sports shouldn't need large and complex new venues.\n\nEstanguet said Paris organizers are also aiming to make the 2024 Games more participative than ever, by allowing members of the public to test themselves against the performances of Olympic athletes, in the real world or virtually.\n\nThat could include organizing a public marathon on the same route the Olympians run on, and on the same day. Organizers also are exploring connected technology that might allow spectators to virtually compete against Olympians. That could include riding a stationary bike at home and comparing that performance against those of cyclists in the Olympic races.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports"}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/number-hate-groups-us-hits-time-high-report/story?id=61186850", "text": "The number of hate groups in the U.S. has reached an all-time high, even as membership in the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi outfits have fallen, according to a report by a legal advocacy organization that tracks them.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center's annual \"Year in Hate and Extremism\" report counted 1,020 hate groups in the nation, an increase of 7 percent from the 954 tallied in 2017.\n\nThe previous record for hate groups in the country was in 2011, when 1,018 were counted at the \"height of a backlash\" against the first black president of the U.S., Barack Obama, said Heidi Beirich, director of intelligence for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images) Police tape is viewed around the area, Oct. 28, 2018, outside the Tree of Life Synagogue after a fatal shooting in Pittsburgh, Oct. 27, 2018.\n\nThis year's report showed that the number of hate groups has grown for four straight years.\n\n\"This time period dovetails with [Donald] Trump's campaign and then his presidency, a period that has seen a 30 percent increase in the number of these groups,\" Beirich said.\n\n(David Swanson/The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP) Local and federal authorities remove a suspicious package found at a US postal facility in Wilmington, Del., Oct. 25, 2018.

Because you always wonder as an adoptee, whose eyes do I have? Whose hands?\" Christine said. \"Now, I have my sister, and we're so much alike.\n\n(ABC News) Kim Haelen, left, and Christine Pennell found themselves not only similar in appearance but also the way of life.\n\nThey decided to reunite where they were separated. So on Feb. 15, Christine flew to South Korea from Connecticut and Kim from Belgium to make up for the time they missed over the last 47 years.\n\nKim pulled into the Daegu subway station where she was abandoned all those years ago and saw her sister waiting for her train.\n\n\"And we're now together,\" Kim told ABC News. \"It's wonderful.\"\n\nIn South Korea, Christine and Kim did what all sisters would do growing up together: They picked out dresses for each other at the mall and tried traditional Korean cuisine. They realized they had more things in common than just the looks.\n\n\"We both don\u2019t like fish. We both like to sing and dance. We both like to smile and laugh a lot and are very silly. We pretty much have a good amount of energy,\" Christine said, adding that they're both mothers to grown children themselves.\n\nNow they've found each other, Christine and Kim are hoping to find their birth parents. During their week-long visit to South Korea, they made flyers and distributed them across community centers and police stations in Daegu, hoping someone would recognize the sisters from their pictures.\n\n\"The fact that we\u2019re full-blood sisters means our parents were together long enough for us both to be born. And there\u2019s a good chance that they're still together and we may have more siblings,\" Christine said.\n\n\"I want to know who they are,\" Kim said, \"and I want to search with Christine.\"\n\nABC News\u2019 Joohee Cho, Sorah Choi and Hansol Park contributed to this report."}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/mexican-scientists-find-cure-hpv-heres/story?id=61209423", "text": "\u201cMexican scientist cures HPV!\u201d\n\nYou may have seen this headline trending on social media: a \u201ccure\u201d for human papillomavirus and the cancers it causes.\n\nEven Mexican-born actress Salma Hayek congratulated the female-led team for their \u201cgroundbreaking research helping cure HPV leading to the prevention of cervical cancer\u201d on her Instagram account.\n\nSadly, a woman loses her life to cervical cancer every two minutes -- and most of these women are living in areas of poverty.\n\nAll the more reason why a trending article claiming to have cured HPV is exciting. According to a media report from Mexico, the scientists used photodynamic therapy (PDT) -- a two-step treatment using a light-sensitive drug (5-aminolevulinic acid or 5-ALA) followed by activation with a specific wavelength of light to target HPV cells -- as a non-invasive method to eradicate 100 percent of HPV from 29 women.\n\nSo, are these reports true? Have we arrived at a cure for HPV and cancer?\n\nNot quite yet.\n\nWhile the research and data are interesting, their work remains unpublished in a peer-reviewed journal. The group does have published data from a small study in 2017.\n\nThe researchers did not respond to multiple attempts by ABC News to reach them for comment.\n\nWhat do we know about HPV?\n\nHPV viruses are found in 80 million people in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are hundreds of subtypes of HPV, and 1 in 4 people in the U.S. are infected with HPV at some point in their lives.\n\nIn Mexico, 7,869 new cervical cases are diagnosed annually, and more than 4,000 women in Mexico die each year from cervical cancer, according to a December 2018 report by the HPV Information Centre.\n\nCervical cancer is also the third leading cause of cancer in women in the country and second leading cause of female cancer deaths there, especially among women between the ages of 15 and 44, the report said.\n\nHere are the most up to date facts about cervical cancer from the CDC and from recent research published in The Lancet:\n\nHPV is spread through intimate physical contact; however, not all strains of HPV cause cancer. Some strains, (like 6 and 11) cause warts. HPV high-risk subtypes (such as 16 and 18) are most likely to lead to cervical cancer in women.\n\nWhile some people clear HPV infections on their own without any type of medical treatment, others, especially with a weakened immune system, may have advanced HPV disease, which may lead to cancer if left untreated.\n\nCurrently, doctors routinely screen for cervical cancer with the Pap test and HPV DNA testing depending on age and risk factors, which is called co-testing.\n\nSo, is there a single way that HPV can be cured, as the Mexican researchers\u2019 work suggests?\n\nDr. H. Hunter Handsfield, professor emeritus of Medicine at the University of Washington\u2019s Center for AIDS and STD, likes to think of HPV infection as an \u201ciceberg disease.\u201d Some of the tissues infected with HPV are visible to the eye; these are the tissues that are the ones targeted for removal.\n\nOther HPV infected tissues may remain beneath the surface, though.\n\nThis is especially relevant because the National Cancer Institute (NCI) states that PDT, as used by the Mexican researchers, has several limitations. PDT is typically a local treatment because the light needed to activate 5-ALA cannot pass through more than 1 centimeter of tissue, making it difficult to treat cancer cells below a tissue\u2019s surface or cancer that has metastasized.\n\nWhile the FDA has approved PDT technology as one type of treatment for esophageal and non-small cell lung cancers, more work is needed to determine whether PDT can be used for other cancers.\n\nHandsfield says this is why cervical cancer is hard to cure.\n\n\u201cOnce HPV is detected, doctors suggest that their patients have regular screening depending on the type of HPV they have, and the degree of tissue changes that have occurred.\u201d\n\nSo what are Handsfield\u2019s recommendations when he sees articles that describe a cure for HPV and cancer?\n\n\u201cBe skeptical. Examine whether the article comes from a cited medical publication that has been peer-reviewed and is not preliminary data. The notion that all types of HPV can be cured by a single treatment or method is not a practical one.\u201d\n\nHandsfield shared advice in light of the report.\n\n\"Get vaccinated. We are moving towards a time where we shouldn\u2019t be worried about treating HPV. We have vaccines that can prevent us from getting an HPV infection and cancer in the first place, assuming a person is vaccinated before they are exposed to the virus.\u201d\n\nThe FDA-approved vaccine currently protects against nine common strains of HPV.\n\nHence, the cure is in prevention, but there is still a bit of time to go.\n\nAlexandra H.

Cheese's in suburban Chicago on Monday afternoon, 9-year-old softball player Marie Marcum had one goal: to play an MLB-licensed throwing game and show off her skills. But after she started chucking the red rubber balls at the target, Marcum heard something that infuriated her.\n\n\"Hey,\" the game chirped, \"there's always softball!\"\n\nMarcum, who has played softball since she was 4, was furious. She started throwing harder and harder. Her mom looked over, wondering what was going on. \"Did you hear that?\" Marcum asked her mom. \"I missed one throw and the game said I should try softball.\"\n\n(Courtesy of the Marcum family) Nine-year-old Marie Marcum wrote a letter to Major League Baseball.\n\nMarcum swiped her card again. And again, included among the variety of taunts during gameplay was the suggestion that she should try softball.\n\n\"I was really mad,\" she told ESPN. \"It made me feel like they think softball is a bad sport and girls shouldn't play softball. I just started throwing balls at the game as hard as I could. I thought it was rude.\"\n\n(Courtesy the Marcum family) The game at Chuck E. Cheese's that Marie Marcum played.\n\nMarcum and her mother spoke to an employee at the arcade, but that didn't numb the girl's frustration. On the ride home, she couldn't stop thinking -- or talking -- about how irritated she was. Her mom, a high school teacher, suggested she write a letter to the game manufacturer, Innovative Concepts in Entertainment (ICE), based in upstate New York. But her uncle pointed out the game was called \"Major League Baseball\" and was covered in MLB logos. Her parents are big baseball fans -- her dad cheers for the White Sox and her mom the Cubs. \"I like the Cubs a little better,\" she said. So she asked if she could write a letter to Major League Baseball.\n\nOn Monday night, she sat at her kitchen table and did just that.\n\n\"I wanted to tell someone how mad and upset I was and let them know what they could do to fix the game and make it better,\" she said.\n\nMarcum thought of her 4-year-old cousin, who this summer will start playing sports for the first time and is deciding between basketball, soccer and softball.\n\n\"I'm trying to encourage her to play softball,\" she said. \"But if I brought her to that game she might not want to play softball. I just don't think that's right.\"\n\nAdded Lisa Marcum, Marie's mom: \"Here we are at Chuck E. Cheese, a place with so many impressionable little kids and we're saying you throw like a girl or hit like a girl or whatever. I thought we had moved past that.\"\n\nInnovative Concepts in Entertainment, founded in 1982, says on its website it is an industry leader in the production of sports games for the home, arcade and office. The Major League Baseball name and logos were used through a licensing agreement that expired in 2011. In a statement released Wednesday, an MLB spokesperson said, \"MLB does not support the message conveyed in the game and we are reaching out to the company to share our concerns about it.\"\n\nICE president Joe Coppola said Wednesday his company manufactured the game for two years, beginning in 2009, and this is the first complaint it has received.\n\n\"I completely understand where she is coming from,\" Coppola said. \"I get it. There is probably a greater sensitivity today than there was 10 or 15 years ago. It's something we all need to pay attention to.\"\n\nCoppola said there are \"thousands\" of games in the marketplace today and said it wouldn't be a problem to remove the offending audio clip from the game if requested to do so.\n\nA Chuck E. Cheese representative said the company did just that on Wednesday -- asked ICE to remove the taunt \"to support everyone's love of play.\" Until that happens, the representative said all Chuck E. Cheese stores will mute the sound on the game.\n\n\"We're thankful to Marie for bringing this to our attention and agree -- play and sports are for everyone.\"\n\n(Courtesy of the Marcum family) Nine-year-old Marie Marcum wrote a letter to Major League Baseball telling them about a MLB-licensed throwing game that made fun of softball, which she wrote made her feel \"that I wasn't good enough.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday, Major League Baseball had not yet received Marcum's letter, but said it planned to reach out to her family with a few ideas to celebrate her love of softball.\n\n\"We love Marie's passion for softball and her view that softball is just as great as baseball,\" the statement read. \"Through our PLAY BALL program, growing youth softball has remained a priority for MLB, equally as important as growing youth baseball.\"\n\nThe Marcums, meanwhile, are thrilled their objections are being heard after Lisa posted a photo of her daughter's letter on Facebook Monday night.\n\n\"I'm just so proud of her,\" Lisa said. \"She did this all on her own. The one thing I hope she remembers from this is if there is something she feels strongly about in the future, she will remember that people want to hear her. If nothing else, this will encourage her to speak up.\"\n\nAs for Marie, while waiting for the brutal Chicago winter to thaw so she can start her 10U season with the Plainfield Twisters, she has a new idea on how to kill the time.\n\n\"I'm starting to wonder if there are other games like this that are rude or upsetting,\" she said. \"I might need to write some more letters.\"\n\nABC News and espnW.com are both owned by Disney."}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Travel/disney-reveals-latest-epcot-plans-interactive-city/story?id=61212236", "text": "Get excited: there's more awesomeness coming to Epcot.\n\nAn interactive city will be part of a new play pavilion, with a re-imagined main entrance and experience center, Disney announced Thursday.\n\nThe new play pavilion includes an interactive city where games and hands-on activities allow guests to interact with their favorite Disney characters.

However, if you're not careful, it's easy to rack up a huge bill after just a few days on board. How? While some lines or sailings include alcohol, many don't, leaving cruisers with heavy bar tabs. There are also specialty restaurants, the spa, and shore excursions that all typically costs extra. The sheer amount of add-ons and activities can make your head spin and your wallet thin, but there are a few tricks that can help you save a bundle. Here are 12 easy ways to save money on your next cruise.\n\n1. Reserve an inside cabin on a cruise.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Pride of America.\n\nInside cabins are not as bad as you might think. Before you groan, hear us out: Most cruisers won't spend a lot of time in their rooms, so splurging on an expensive cabin can be a waste. Plus, no windows mean no interruptions to your sleep from the morning sun.\n\n2. Be savvy about booking spa treatments.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Rhapsody of the Seas.\n\nWhile several cruises include basic food and drink in the rate, almost none cover spa treatments. Because cruises make a lot of money through massages and other indulgences at the spa, rates can get high -- unless you know when to book for the best discounts. Normally, we would never suggest pre-booking anything on a cruise since so many deals are offered only once you're onboard, but the spa is different. Discounts are sometimes offered for a short period before the cruise starts and during embarkation day -- when the spa is likely to have slim to no customers. Another great day for discounts? Port days. Why? Because most folks are out exploring, leaving the spa to collect dust instead of money.\n\n3. Drink for free (or cheap) on your cruise ship.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The MSC Divina.\n\nDon't want to shell out an arm and a leg for alcohol onboard? Most cruises have at least one (if not several) opportunities to get free or cheap drinks. Royal Caribbean has a mimosa happy hour -- in the morning, at the casino -- where you can snag mimosas for two bucks. Carnival offers free Champagne when you check out the art events. There are also some dedicated happy hours at ship bars to bring in customers during off-hours. Most ships also have a drink of the day that's offered for a discount. Check your daily cruise newsletter for any and all events where you can snag discounted or free drinks.\n\n4. Know when to book your dining packages.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Queen Mary 2.\n\nLike spa treatments, dining packages are available for a small discount if you book ahead of your sailing. While it can be tempting, don't do it. Hold out for the last few days (or last day, if your sailing is short), when you'll start seeing great discounts and deals come through. Much like the dining establishments on land, restaurants on cruises need to sell out of the food in their kitchens. It's also wise to hit up some of the for-fee specialty restaurants during lunch when both the menu and prices are truncated.\n\n5. Pass on all cruise drink packages, except one.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Carnival Triumph.\n\nWhile we recommend waiting it out for the dining packages, we say skip the drink packages completely -- except soda for kids. Most folks we've spoken to regret this purchase and say they find themselves unnecessarily drinking booze, just to make their package worth the price. To break even, most people have to drink seven or so alcoholic beverages per day. A good rule of thumb is to wait until you're onboard, check the drink prices, examine the deals, and see if you think the package will be worthwhile. Keep in mind that some ships require that everyone of legal drinking age purchase a drink package even if they don't plan on boozing.\n\n6. BYOB.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Caribbean Princess.\n\nCheers to another alcohol-related tip! Most cruise lines allow each guest to bring on a certain amount and type of alcohol. Some even permit a stipend of soda or water. Most Royal Caribbean sailings allow two 750-milliliter bottles of wine or Champagne per stateroom, while Carnival and Princess bump up the limit to one bottle per person on embarkation, as long as it's in their checked luggage. Disney has a slightly more lax rule that allows for either two bottles of wine or bubbly, or a six-pack of bottled beer, but all have to be kept in carry-on luggage. On Norwegian, guests can only bring on wine or Champagne, but there are no limits on how many bottles are permitted per person or stateroom. Don't forget the bottle opener.\n\n7. Prepay for Wi-Fi on your cruise (or skip it entirely).\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Celebrity Solstice.\n\nYou'll likely want at least the most basic Wi-Fi package while on board. If your ship doesn't include Wi-Fi -- which most don't -- you might not even be able to use the ship's app to communicate with fellow passengers in your party. Luckily, you can save some cash by pre-purchasing your Wi-Fi plan, with around 20 percent off. Once you're on board, don't expect discounts. If you really want to save, forgo Wi-Fi entirely. A digital detox can really help reset the brain.\n\n8. Know the best time to book a cruise.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Royal Princess.\n\nSimilar to other forms of travel, cruises offer discounts as the sail date approaches. Deals are also often available for off-season sailings or when booking well in advance. Basically, be flexible, and you will be rewarded with extra cash, on board credit, and deep discounts. It also helps to book through a third-party vendor, who can sometimes offer lower prices than the cruise line.\n\n9. Check your receipts.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The MS Oosterdam.\n\nGratuities are usually included on most sailings, but the uninitiated may not realize that this also applies to food and drink services. Check your receipts to make sure an 18 percent gratuity hasn't already been added before you write in an additional tip. This can come as a real shock to first-time cruisers.\n\n10. Skip the sales pitch for your next cruise.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Norwegian Dawn.\n\nToward the end of the sailing, you'll notice that the sales team onboard will try and get folks to book their next cruise. For annual cruisers, this is great (though many seasoned cruisers will also pass). Folks who don't cruise often should skip the sales pitch. While they tout deals, it's not always the case, and sometimes, you can end up spending more money than if you waited to book.\n\n11. Check out your other cruise excursion options.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Enchantment of the Seas.\n\nShore excursions are easy enough to book, but that convenience will cost you a pretty penny. If you're looking to save some serious cash, check out some of the options offered at port that aren't available through your cruise line. It's a great way to contribute directly to the local economy as well. Or, skip the tour entirely and walk around, hit the beach, or make your own excursion. The only time we recommend booking through the ship is if your destination is notorious for scamming tourists or is unsafe.\n\n12. Consider cruise loyalty programs.\n\n(Oyster.com ) The Harmony of the Seas.\n\nCruise lines have loyalty programs that reward returning and frequent cruisers. As points add up, so do the perks. Depending on your loyalty program level, you can get discounts on drinks and activities on board, shopping deals, room upgrades, and welcome amenities. Returning guests also receive discounts on actual cruise rates, so it's a win-win situation."}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Style/victorias-secret-announces-return-swimwear-discontinuing-2016/story?id=61186854", "text": "Victoria's Secret is bringing back swimwear.\n\nThe lingerie and lifestyle brand will release a \"curated collection\" next month after getting rid of swim styles in 2016.\n\nThe company reportedly discontinued the category at the time to prioritize athleisure and lingerie styles.

Here are highlights among nominees and those who went on to win.\n\n1. 'Black Panther' the 1st superhero film nominated for best picture\n\n(Marvel Studios) Chadwick Boseman in a scene from the movie Black Panther.\n\nThe 2008 film \"The Dark Knight\" seemed like the great hope for the genre. After all, the late Heath Ledger did earn a best supporting actor award for his turn as The Joker. But the film failed to score a nomination for best picture.\n\n2.

And it paid off, not only for the film's $700 million haul, but because she's Marvel's first female production designer and the first black production designer in the category.

Variety called it \"uncharted territory.\" Deadline suggested it is \"one of the closest races in academy history.\"\n\nOscar balloting concluded Tuesday night. With days to go before show time Sunday, here's a rundown of the contenders and why each one has reason to hope.\n\nROMA\n\n(The Associated Press) This image released by Netflix shows Yalitza Aparicio, center, in a scene from the film \"Roma,\" by filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. The film is nominated for an Oscar for both best foreign language film and best picture. The 91st Academy Awards will be held on Sunday. (Carlos Somonte/Netflix via AP)\n\nMany think this is Netflix's Oscar to lose, and, boy, do they want to win it. Alfonso Cuaron's black-and-white drama has some major dings against it. Most notably it was entirely overlooked by the Screen Actors Guild. (All but two films in the last 20 years have needed a SAG ensemble nod to win best picture.) But it remains the critics' choice (both New York and Los Angeles critics groups named it best film), and it won at both the Directors Guild Awards and the BAFTAs. Its 10 nominations evidence widespread esteem for \"Roma,\" including two unexpected acting nods (Yalitza Aparacio, Marina de Tavira). Some prominent academy members ( like Steven Spielberg ) have said the Emmys are the proper place for Netflix films. But \"Roma,\" Netflix's first best-picture nominee, may have turned the tide. It would be doubly historic: \"Roma\" would be the first foreign-language best-picture winner.\n\nGREEN BOOK\n\n(Patti Perret/Universal Pictures) Mahershala Ali as Dr. Donald Shirley and Viggo Mortensen as Tony Vallelonga in \"Green Book,\" directed by Peter Farrelly.\n\nPeter Farrelly's interracial road trip drama seems to be the strongest challenger to \"Roma.\" It won at both the Golden Globes and the Producers Guild Awards , which, like the Oscars, use a preferential ballot. But no movie has been more dogged by criticism. While some see a snappy, feel-good buddy movie, others see an outdated and inauthentic set-up that trades on racial stereotypes. In a close race, can such a polarizing film win? \"Green Book,\" so often compared to 1989's best picture-winning \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" may be exactly the kind of movie that once won best picture. But the film academy's membership has in recent years diversified and grown more international .\n\nTHE FAVOURITE\n\n(Twentieth Century Fox) Olivia Colman in the film, \"The Favourite.\"\n\nYorgos Lanthimos' period romp comes tied with \"Roma\" for the most nominations and yet it has few assured wins. It won seven awards at the BAFTAs (where \"Roma\" ultimately took the top award). As a British period drama, \"The Favourite\" has the look of a traditional Oscar winner but gleefully inverts and subverts typical traits of the genre \u2014 making it kind of a perfect Academy Awards Trojan horse.\n\nBOHEMIAN RHAPSODY\n\n(The Associated Press) This image released by Twentieth Century Fox shows Rami Malek in a scene from \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" Malek is nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his role in the film. The 91st Academy Awards will be held on Sunday. (Alex Bailey/Twentieth Century Fox via AP)\n\nCritics don't like it . Some say it sanitizes Freddie Mercury's homosexuality. And its director, Bryan Singer, was fired mid-production and is now facing (and denying) numerous allegations of sexual misconduct . These are not the normal ingredients for a best-picture contender. And yet \"BoRhap\" abides. Not only that, Singer's biopic is a massive hit, especially abroad, with more than $850 million in ticket sales worldwide. It won not just best picture, drama, at the Globes , but took top honors at the ACE Eddie Awards as the best edited drama. Were \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to win, some would slam it as the worst best-picture winner ever. Fans would simply sing \"We Are the Champions.\"\n\nA STAR IS BORN\n\n(Warner Bros. Pictures) Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a scene from the movie, \"A Star is Born.\"\n\nSomething went amiss for the once-presumed front-runner. Bradley Cooper's remake (also a box-office hit with $423 million globally) has been nominated just about everywhere and yet has gone home with little, besides awards for its music. It still scored seven Oscar nominations, but not since 1934 has a movie without either a directing or editing nod won best picture. No amount of Cooper cameos at Lady Gaga concerts seems able to save it. Also not helping: only two remakes have ever won best picture: 1959's \"Ben-Hur\" and 2006's \"The Departed.\"\n\nBLACKKKLANSMAN\n\n(The Associated Press) This image released by Focus Features shows Adam Driver, left, and John David Washington in a scene from \"BlacKkKlansman.\" The film is nominated for an Oscar for best picture. The 91st Academy Awards will be held on Sunday. (David Lee/Focus Features via AP)\n\nSpike Lee's latest joint doesn't have a lot of big wins from the precursor awards, but it's the only movie nominated by every major guild. That speaks to a broad support that no other film can match. Many would also like to see Lee, who was given an honorary Oscar in 2015, win his first competitive Academy Award. Lee has called his film this year's dark horse, \"pun intended.\"\n\nBLACK PANTHER\n\n(The Associated Press) This image released by Disney shows a scene from Marvel Studios' \"Black Panther.\" The film is nominated for an Oscar for best picture. The 91st Academy Awards will be held on Sunday. (Matt Kennedy/Marvel Studios-Disney via AP)\n\nFirst the bad news. Only once before has a movie with no other major nominations won best picture, and that was \"Wings\" in 1927, when they were giving out two top awards (the other went to \"Sunrise\"). The academy tried to bring back that best-picture dichotomy for this Oscars, only to abandon plans for a best popular film category that \"Black Panther\" would have likely won. But Ryan Coogler's Marvel epic, the first superhero movie ever nominated for best picture, is unique in many ways. It's the year's biggest domestic hit with more than $700 million in North America where it was received as a cultural milestone. It also triumphed at the Screen Actors Guild Awards . A best-picture win wouldn't be the first time \"Black Panther\" made history.\n\nVICE\n\n(Matt Kennedy/Annapurna Pictures) Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney and Christian Bale as Dick Cheney in \"Vice.\"\n\nAdam McKay's Dick Cheney biopic probably has the longest odds of any of the eight nominees. But, then again, it does have nominations in all the big areas: acting (Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell), screenplay (McKay), directing (McKay) and editing (Hank Corwin).

His tickets \u2014 for running a light and not carrying proof of insurance \u2014 were dismissed.\n\nYet the stop lives with him.\n\nTraffic stops \u2014 the most common interaction between police and the public \u2014 have become a focal point in the debate about race, law enforcement, and equality in America. A disproportionate share of the estimated 20 million police traffic stops in the United States each year involve black drivers, even though they are no more likely to break traffic laws than whites. Black and Hispanic motorists are more likely than whites to be searched by police, although they are no more likely to be carrying contraband.\n\nAcross the country, law-abiding black and Hispanic drivers are left frightened and humiliated by the inordinate attention they receive from police, who too often see them as criminals. Such treatment leaves blacks and Hispanics feeling violated, angry, and wary of police and their motives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pulled over simply for no other reason than you fit a description and the description is that you\u2019re black.\u201d Read their stories\n\nActivists have taken to the streets to protest police shootings of unarmed black people. Athletes, including NFL players, have knelt or raised clenched fists during the singing of the national anthem at sports events to try to shine a light on lingering inequality.\n\nVereen had always told his children that the police were real-life superheroes. Now that story had to change. \u201cEverything I told them seems to be untrue,\u201d said Vereen, 34. \u201cWhy is this superhero trying to hurt my dad? Why is this superhero doing this to us? He is supposed to be on our side.\u201d\n\nThe first time my now-28-year-old son was stopped by police, he was a high school student in Baltimore. He was headed to a barbershop when he was startled by flashing lights and the sight of two police cars pulling up behind him. The stop lasted just a few minutes and resulted in no ticket. It seems the cops just wanted to check him out. My son\u2019s fear morphed into indignation when an officer returned his license, saying, \u201cA lot of vehicles like yours are stolen.\u201d He was driving a Honda Civic, one of the most popular cars on the road.\n\n\u201cA very familiar feeling comes each time I\u2019m stopped. And that\u2019s the same feeling I got the first time I was stopped, when I was 17 years old.\u201d\n\nShaken by cases in which seemingly routine traffic stops turn deadly, many black parents rehearse with their children what to do if they are pulled over: Lower your car window so officers have a clear line of sight, turn on the interior lights, keep your hands visible, have your license and registration accessible, and for God\u2019s sake, let the officer know you are reaching for them so he doesn\u2019t shoot you.\n\nDrivers of all races worry about running afoul of the rules of the road. But blacks and Hispanics, in particular, also worry about being stopped if they are driving a nice car in a modest or upscale community, a raggedy car in a mostly white one, or any kind of car in a high-crime area. It affects everyone, from ministers and professional athletes to lawyers and the super-rich.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been more times than I care to remember,\u201d said Robert F. Smith, 55, a private equity titan and philanthropist, when asked how often he thinks he has been racially profiled. Smith, with a net worth of more than $3 billion, is listed by Forbes as the nation\u2019s wealthiest African-American. Yet he still dreads being pulled over.\n\n\u201cA very familiar feeling comes each time I\u2019m stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the same feeling I got the first time I was stopped, when I was 17 years old.\u201d\n\nRosie Villegas-Smith, a Mexican-born U.S. citizen who has lived in Phoenix for 28 years, has been stopped a couple of times by Maricopa County sheriff\u2019s deputies, who are notorious for using allegations of minor traffic violations to check the immigration status of Hispanic drivers.\n\nIn 2011 federal investigators found that the department pulled over Hispanic drivers up to nine times more often than other motorists. The stops were part of a crackdown on undocumented immigrants ordered by Joe Arpaio, the Maricopa County sheriff from 1993 to 2016.\n\nCourts ruled the stops illegal, but Arpaio pressed ahead and was found guilty of criminal contempt in July 2017. President Donald Trump \u2014 who has stoked racial tensions by bashing immigrants, protesting athletes, and others \u2014 pardoned Arpaio the following month. Arpaio recently announced plans to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe statistics on traffic stops elsewhere are spotty \u2014 neither uniformly available nor comprehensive \u2014 but they show the same pattern of blacks and Hispanics being stopped and searched more frequently than others. The disparity spans the nation, affecting drivers in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Men are more at risk than women, and for black men, being disproportionately singled out is virtually a universal experience.\n\nA 2017 study in Connecticut, one of the few states that collect and analyze comprehensive traffic-stop data, found that police disproportionately pull over black and Hispanic drivers during daylight hours, when officers can more easily see who is behind the wheel. Many police departments have policies and training to prevent racial profiling, but those rules can get lost in day-to-day police work.\n\n\u201cOne reason minorities are stopped disproportionately is because police see violations where they are,\u201d said Louis Dekmar, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, who runs the Police Department in LaGrange, Georgia. \u201cCrime is often significantly higher in minority neighborhoods than elsewhere. And that is where we allocate our resources. That is the paradox.\u201d\n\nToo often, officers treat minorities driving in mostly white areas as suspect, Dekmar said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, and there is no excuse for that,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI felt embarrassed. Emasculated. I felt absolutely like I had no rights.\u201d Watch: The feeling of being stopped\n\nRobert L. Wilkins was a public defender in 1992 when he and several family members were stopped by a Maryland state trooper while returning to Washington, D.C., from his grandfather\u2019s funeral in Chicago. The trooper accused them of speeding, then asked to search their rented Cadillac. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nothing to hide, then what\u2019s your problem?\u201d the trooper said when they objected to the search on principle.\n\nThe trooper made them wait for a drug-sniffing dog. As Wilkins and his family stood on the side of the highway, a German shepherd sniffed \u201cseemingly every square inch of the car\u2019s exterior,\u201d Wilkins recalled. Before long, there were five or six police cars around them. At one point, Wilkins, now a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, noticed a white couple and their two children staring as they rode by. He imagined that they thought the worst: \u201cThey\u2019re putting two and two together and getting five,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see black people and they\u2019re thinking, \u2018These are bad people.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWilkins filed a class-action suit alleging an illegal search and racial profiling, and the state of Maryland settled, largely because of an unearthed police document that had warned troopers to be on the lookout for black men in rental cars, who were suspected of ferrying crack cocaine. The settlement required state police to keep statistics on the race and ethnicity of drivers who were stopped. A second suit forced police to revamp their complaint system. Those changes brought some improvement, and racial disparities in traffic stops in Maryland were cut in half.\n\nWhat lingers, though, is the indignity and anger that drivers feel over being singled out. \u201cThere\u2019s a power that they want to exert, that you have to experience. And what do you do about it?\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere\u2019s an embedded terror in our community, and that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d\n\nAbout this story: The Undefeated teamed up with National Geographic to ask people of color across the U.S. what it\u2019s like to be racially profiled during a traffic stop, and the ripple effect such incidents can have on families and communities. This report also appears in the April issue of National Geographic Magazine and online at natgeo.com/theraceissue.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pulled over simply for no other reason than you fit a description and the description is that you\u2019re black.\u201d The Profiled Young and old, famous or just regular folks, drivers from Chicago to small-town Connecticut, Phoenix to rural Maryland, share their stories about being stopped by police without cause. Those experiences changed how and where they drive and damaged their trust in the police. Photographs by Wayne Lawrence for National Geographic Magazine Anquan Boldin and C.J. Jones (right) Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin retired from football last year in part because of the 2015 killing of his cousin, Corey Jones, who was shot by a plainclothes police officer while calling for a tow truck from his disabled SUV. Boldin has struggled to reconcile his memory of Jones \u2014 always smiling, never confrontational \u2014 with his violent death. He thinks few whites fully grasp the daily indignities endured by many African-Americans. Growing up in Florida, Boldin remembers going to stores with his friends and being let in only one at a time. As a millionaire athlete, he has been pulled over by police on numerous occasions. Now, his cousin is dead. \u201cAs a young kid, you know something\u2019s not right, but you can\u2019t quite put your finger on it,\u201d Boldin said. \u201cAnd then, the older you get, the more you realize exactly what it is.\u201d Woody Vereen Bridgeport, Conn. Woody Vereen, a former Morehouse College football player and a music minister at his church, was taking his two young sons for Italian ice in 2015 when two Bridgeport, Connecticut, police officers pulled him over for allegedly running a yellow light. Vereen produced his license and registration and the police asked for permission to search his car. Vereen refused, but he was still ordered out of his car and frisked. His vehicle was searched as his two frightened sons looked on. The officers found nothing, but they gave Vereen tickets for allegedly running the light and not carrying proof of car insurance. Vereen sued, alleging the police searched him without probable cause. Last year, he won a settlement from the city of Bridgeport and a judge dismissed both tickets. Robyn Porter New Haven, Conn. Robyn Porter was a newly minted member of the Connecticut House of Representatives when a New Haven police officer pulled her over in 2014. Before she could ask why she was being stopped, \u201cI need to make sure your plates aren\u2019t stolen,\u201d she recalls him saying. He took her license and registration and warned that it would be a \u201cserious federal offense\u201d if the legislative plates on her car were not hers. They were her plates, of course, and the officer was contrite afterward. Still, the whole encounter left Porter angry. \u201cI asked myself, \u2018Wow, where is this coming from?\u2019 I just can\u2019t fathom how he came to the conclusion that I had stolen plates.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think, in this country, breaking down on the side of the road should be a death sentence for anyone. And, for what my family is going through at this moment, I don\u2019t wish that on anybody.\u201d Daniel Magos Phoenix, Ariz. Daniel Magos was headed to a home improvement job in 2009 when a Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff\u2019s deputy slowed his cruiser and stared at him and his wife, Eva. Before long, the officer pulled them over. He demanded their driver\u2019s licenses, searched Eva\u2019s purse and frisked Daniel but found nothing. Finally, the deputy let them go, leaving the Magoses embarrassed and furious. Daniel, now 71, joined a class-action lawsuit that proved the department, then led by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, engaged in racial profiling and unlawful traffic stops in their crackdown on illegal immigrants. Both Magos and his wife were U.S. citizens, yet their brown skin caused them to be caught in Arpaio\u2019s dragnet. Eva Magos took the humiliation of the stop to her grave. She died in 2016 at age 76. Robert Wilkins Cumberland, Md. The term \u201cdriving while black\u201d had not yet entered the lexicon when Robert Wilkins and three family members were pulled over by a Maryland state trooper while returning from his grandfather\u2019s funeral in 1992. The trooper claimed they were speeding, but before writing a ticket he asked to search their rented Cadillac. Wilkins, a lawyer, refused for reasons both legal and practical: There was no cause for a search, plus he had to be in court in a few hours. Still, the trooper summoned a drug-sniffing dog, which found no contraband, and Wilkins and his family were let go. Wilkins, now a federal appeals court judge, sued and in 1995 won a settlement. It required Maryland troopers to document the race of drivers stopped on the state\u2019s highways, data that provided hard evidence that racial profiling is real. Perrell Bess Hickory, N.C. Perrell Bess was taking a shortcut through his hometown of Hickory, North Carolina, in 2013 when he saw police lights in his rearview mirror. Right away, the aspiring lawyer and his wife knew what to do. He pulled over and got his license out, while his wife fished for the registration from the glove compartment. He put his window down and his hands on the steering wheel. The police were firing questions: \u201cWhose car are you driving? Where are you coming from at this time of night?\u201d But once they ran Bess\u2019 license, there were no more questions and no ticket. The only explanation offered for the stop was an unlikely one: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t see your tag. Your tag was dirty.\u201d Bess was incredulous. He had washed his car the previous day. James Newman III New Haven, Conn. James Newman III, pastor of New Freedom Missionary Baptist Church in New Haven, Connecticut, was driving a friend to the store last summer when he was startled by the flashing lights of a police car pulling him over. \u201cDo you have a gun in your car?\u201d the officer asked. Newman was bewildered. Soon more police pulled up, and Newman was told to get out and put his hands on the side of his car. That\u2019s when a police captain he knew arrived on the scene. He told his officers to stand down. There had been reports of gunshots in the area, and the officers thought Newman may have been responsible. They did not know that he was a minister or that he worked with police on anti-violence initiatives. \u201cI looked like I could have had a gun in my car, I guess,\u201d Newman said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to prove that I have some sort of legitimate reason to be on the highway. We should be 150 years beyond black folks having to have their papers to show that they\u2019re free, you know?\u201d Robert Smith Denver, Colo. Robert Smith, a multibillionaire software investor, says he was 17 the first time he was stopped by police. Since then, it has happened repeatedly. Once, an officer crossed the median of a four-lane highway and pulled him over because Smith\u2019s new car had temporary \u2014 and legal \u2014 tags. Another time, he was in a sports car headed to the gym at 6 a.m. when he was stopped and cited for driving through a school crossing light. Smith timed and recorded the flashing light before going to court to prove the light was not yet on at the hour he drove by. Smith said the constant police scrutiny is infuriating and exhausting. \u201cHere you are, a middle-aged African-American male, driving a nice car, not doing anything wrong, yet you are followed. You know they are pulling your plates.\u201d Richard Jackson Chicago, Ill. Richard Jackson says he has been stopped by police six times since he returned to Chicago in 2012 after serving 11 years in the Navy. Now a federal immigration officer, Jackson stands his ground if he thinks he has been stopped unfairly. In 2016, officers pulled him over as he was driving into the back of his home on the city\u2019s West Side and gave him two tickets, saying he ran a stop sign and cut them off \u2014 allegations Jackson called bogus. Jackson fought the tickets in court, and as he has done at least five other times, he won. Afterward, he had a dash cam installed in his car to document interactions with police \u2014 adding to the estimated $5,000 he has spent on lawyers and equipment to combat the traffic stops. Jahmal Cole Chicago, Ill. Jahmal Cole, who runs a Chicago youth organization, was riding near his neighborhood Walmart last year with his wife and 6-year-old daughter when he was pulled over by police for the fourth time in two months, he said. The officer said Cole was not wearing a seat belt, although he was. Once the officer ran his license and checked his registration, Cole was free to go \u2014 no ticket, no nothing. Cole believes the cops stop black men for the slightest of reasons in Chicago\u2019s toughest neighborhoods as part of a misguided crime-fighting strategy. But he knows firsthand that interaction with police can have deadly consequences. His aunt, Bettie Jones, was accidentally shot and killed by a Chicago police officer whom she called to her home in 2015 to restrain a mentally ill teen who was threatening a family member with a baseball bat. \u201cI felt embarrassed. Emasculated. I felt absolutely like I had no rights.\u201d What\u2019s \ud83d\udd25 Right Now\n\n\n\nTop NBA prospect Rui Hachimura wants to inspire biracial athletes in Japan Read now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho has the best hair in the NCAA tournament?

Video by National Geographic\n\n\n\nClose"}, {"source": "abc", "url": "https://theundefeated.com/features/childish-gambinos-this-is-america-video-is-a-beautiful-nightmare/", "text": "The night I watched Childish Gambino\u2019s video for \u201cThis Is America,\u201d I was scared. Having skipped the song\u2019s premiere on Saturday Night Live, I\u2019d seen the images and their deconstructions on the internet all weekend. And when I finally sat down to watch the full product, as opposed to just a collection of GIFs and clips, I didn\u2019t even have it in me to turn on the sound.\n\nWhen it comes to \u201cwhat people on the internet say about black [insert word here],\u201d I am instantly leery. And, as a matter of course, I\u2019m instantly fearful of any form of black public expression that white people either identify as something they can\u2019t live without or pull away from. With zero sound, the images from Donald Glover\u2019s latest musical project felt like monsters under the bed.\n\nI had a nightmare that night.\n\nThe next morning, the headlines were predictable, analytical and, in a basic way, accurate. Yes, Glover\u2019s new work combines (insert description for juxtaposition of serious and jovial that represents how black people either stay sane, or don\u2019t). And the new work certainly was designed to provoke (insert group of people here who don\u2019t want to believe that the symbolism of black people killing other black people is ever effective). It is all of these things, certainly.\n\nThe specific mimicry of deplorable stereotypes that call back to an era we try to forget.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I needed someone else to show me in video form exactly what\u2019s torn our nation apart. It\u2019s that with no real major tricks or magic, he could scare me enough into remembering that I won\u2019t see this disaster alleviated in my lifetime. Which, in itself, compounds the original fear, which is why this video is keeping me up at night. As the kids say, I\u2019ve never felt more seen in my life.\n\nSometimes I don\u2019t automatically wake up from a nightmare, even when I know I\u2019m having one. There\u2019s a weird part of me that knows I\u2019m sleeping and wants to explore whether or not I can tackle the specific fear. In this video, there\u2019s an eerily similar pace: Things come and go, and images from the recesses from your brain pop up in ways you never imagined.\n\nYou\u2019ve already read about the guns. The choir. The white horse. The cars. The African dance influences. And, of course, SZA. But those are specifics in a deliberate and detailed oeuvre already witnessed by likely more than hundreds of millions of people.\n\nBut to be clear, this isn\u2019t about anointing Glover/Gambino as some saint. We\u2019ve all seen how problematic that turns out in many cases, and it\u2019s also unfair to the artists themselves. The \u201cgenius\u201d category puts everything in a spotlight that is skewed and often pointless \u2014 and this is not to discredit Glover\u2019s work by any means.\n\nHowever, Glover is not without his wild statements that some may find problematic. He\u2019s said a few things about women of color, specifically Asian women, that are gross on every level. There are a slew of other things \u2014 about rape, about the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 that would make some immediately write him off. He believes, specifically with regard to comedy, that \u201cnothing is off-limits.\u201d\n\nThe difference between Glover and, say, Kanye West (who is completely outta control; these theories of performance art, while perhaps buyable, are stupid on his part) or Kendrick Lamar or any other number of black male artists who\u2019ve been elevated as creative stalwarts is that Glover\u2019s done it almost completely from the inside. He was a writer for the beloved 30 Rock, and then Tina Fey turned around and embarrassed everyone. He starred on Community, a show that, while not a ratings monster, was beloved by an interesting sect of America. You might recall that comedy legend Chevy Chase, whose character was noted for his \u201ccurmudgeonly racism,\u201d was booted off that program.\n\nFX\u2019s Atlanta speaks for itself in terms of impact, scope and influence, but the fact that he got such a plum gig at all is an indication of exactly how much Hollywood loves him. And that\u2019s before we even get to the Grammy nominations, his movies and his historic role as Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Solo: A Star Wars Story. Glover is an insider who\u2019s been allowed to influence within the real framework of the Hollywood system, as opposed to crash-landing as an outsider.\n\nWhich is important to take into consideration when we view \u201cThis Is America.\u201d Glover\u2019s been making content in many forms for years, and what the new song and video represent is a magnum opus-like culmination of all of that. The sequencing of the video alone is incredible. What the artist presents as chaos is less about being happenstance and random and more about being inevitable and ever-present. That\u2019s a reality that\u2019s hard to portray in such a short space of time. It\u2019s also scary.\n\nThe inevitability of destruction. The specific mimicry of deplorable stereotypes that call back to an era we try to forget. Watching him dance the Jim Crow dance is jarring and familiar, which is both equally bizarre and, again, frightening \u2014 the real scope of the black experience in this country. It replays over and over again on television, movies, the internet and, yes, music videos. Glover/Gambino is not exploiting as much as he\u2019s reminding us how well-woven all of it is into our consciousness. And, just like in a dream, where you\u2019re never really sure what\u2019s real and what\u2019s a perverse version of your brain creating a reality you don\u2019t know you can trust, this video makes you ask questions. How am I supposed to know what everything means if it\u2019s all free-flowing, dangerous and unstoppable? That\u2019s the reality of being black in this country in 2018.\n\nWe live in a nation where we have to create apps in order not to waste food. School administrators get violent with kids who are just looking to celebrate their educations. The Ku Klux Klan is legit making a comeback. Police officers are outfitting their cars with the words popo, so we can apparently feel better about fearing for our lives because the tormentors appear with a familiar name. Even with that being well-known, our generational trauma somehow allows us to make fun of the very specific way that we choose to kill each other. It\u2019s insane on every level.\n\nView this post on Instagram Facts A post shared by snoopdogg (@snoopdogg) on May 7, 2018 at 10:56am PDT\n\nWe\u2019ve got 4-year-olds who are adept at handling guns.\n\ni won\u2019t say it, but you know pic.twitter.com/l1vME9bYtI \u2014 Broderick Greer (@BroderickGreer) May 6, 2018\n\nThey do so in front of women appropriating cultures they don\u2019t respect. Yet, all the while, these presentations of Gambino\u2019s are somehow inspirational because it\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever had.\n\nThe final part of this video is the most harrowing because it\u2019s an indication of what I believe to be Glover\u2019s real message: that the capitulation to actual fear results in a flight response that only descendants of slaves can understand. While running for his life from what appears to be a mob of people, the look on his face says it all. Trying to escape in a dark hallway to nothing, the people are gaining on him. He appears to be losing steam but is determined not to stop. The examination of that inner feeling of helplessness that is so often the black experience is what\u2019s most important here. Glover taps into that sentiment in a way that\u2019s hard to grasp if you\u2019ve never lived it.\n\nI\u2019m instantly fearful of any form of black public expression that white people either identify as something they can\u2019t live without or pull away from.\n\nSure, we all know this is a barbaric and screwed-up place on many levels. But it\u2019s also a place where we\u2019ve found a way to thrive in the worst of conditions: shirtless, deliberate and composed. He can sing about staying woke and its importance of that until he\u2019s blue in the face, but \u201cThis Is America\u201d reminds us that the reality is actually scarier than the nightmare we\u2019ve been trapped in since we got here. Waking up might not get you anything but more pain, more despair and, thus, fewer years to enjoy the rights and privileges of life.\n\nThat is America. And that\u2019s exactly what it was created to be."}]
