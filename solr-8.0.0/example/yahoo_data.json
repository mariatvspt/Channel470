The F-21 looks like an F-16.\n\nIn fact, the F-21 is an F-16 that Lockheed has upgraded with new cockpit displays, conformal fuel tanks, a larger airframe spine that can accommodate additional electronics, fittings for towed radar decoys, a new infrared sensor and a refueling probe that's compatible with India's Russian-made aerial tankers.\n\n\"The F-21 addresses the Indian air force\u2019s unique requirements,\" Lockheed stated.\n\nThe rebranding raises an important question. At what point do upgrades transform an old fighter into a new fighter?\n\nIt isn't a purely academic question. The number of different fighter types that a country simultaneously can produce is a useful marker of that country's war-making capacity.\n\nIndia for years has been struggling to replace a large fleet of old, Russian-made warplanes. In 2018 the Indian air force operated 244 1960s-vintage MiG-21s and 84 MiG-27s that are only slightly younger.\n\nThe MiG-21s, in particular, are accident-prone . Since the first of 874 MiG-21s entered Indian service in 1963, around 490 have crashed, killing around 200 pilots.\n\nNew Delhi wants to spend around $18 billion building 115 new fighters to replace the old MiGs. The new planes would fly alongside European-designed Jaguars, French Mirage 2000s and Rafales, Russian MiG-29s and Su-30s, and India's own indigenous Tejas fighter in what Lockheed described as \"the world\u2019s largest fighter aircraft ecosystem.\"\n\nCompetitors for the 115-plane purchase include the F-21, Boeing's F/A-18E/F, the Rafale, the European Typhoon, the Swedish Gripen E and the Russian MiG-35 and Su-35. Indian companies would assemble the new jets on license.\n\nLockheed initially implied India could follow an acquisition of F-21s with a separate purchase of the company's F-35 stealth fighters.\n\n\"The F-21 has common components and learning from Lockheed Martin\u2019s fifth-generation F-22 and F-35 and will share a common supply chain on a variety of components,\" Lockheed stated on its website on the morning of Feb. 20, 2019.\n\nA few hours later, that claim disappeared from the site.\n\nFor the purposes of Lockheed's marketing campaign, the F-21 is a new fighter, although it shares many of its major features with the F-16V the company has sold to Bahrain, Greece, Slovakia, South Korea and Taiwan. Lockheed can build new F-16Vs or upgrade older F-16s to the V-standard.\n\nStill, renaming the F-16V isn't only semantic. An F-16V or F-21 is a radically different warplane compared to the F-16A that first flew in 1978. The F-16A is a nimble, eight-ton fighter with an unsophisticated radar and short-range weapons. The F-16V weighs 10 tons, boasts a cutting-edge radar and other sensors and carries a wide array of long-range weaponry, all at the cost of maneuverability.\n\nThe only thing an F-16A and an F-16V have in common to any meaningful degree is their basic shape. So why not call the F-16V something different?\n\nU.S. officials at one time deliberately stuck with an old designation for a new plane, all in an effort to make a program seem less risky than it actually was.\n\nAfter canceling several fighter programs on cost grounds in the early 1990s, the U.S. Navy tapped Boeing to develop a new fighter with the same basic shape as the existing F/A-18, but with a larger fuselage and wing and more powerful engines and sensors.\n\nThe Navy called the new plane the \"F/A-18E/F.\" But in every way that mattered, it was a new fighter with different capabilities than the original F/A-18 possessed.\n\nLikewise, the Pentagon acquired three separate stealth fighters with the F-35 designation -- the land-based F-35A, the vertically-landing F-35B and the carrier-based F-35C.\n\nThe three F-35 \"variants\" share very few design elements outside of their cockpits. Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, then the head of the F-35 program office, in 2016 told a seminar audience that the F-35 models are only 20- to 25-percent common.\n\nThe danger in not giving a new fighter a new designation is in the impression it creates. In early 2019 China manufactured several fighter types with the basic airframe of the Russian Su-27. Each type has a unique designation. J-11. J-15.

Last year's tally also represents a 7 percent increase over the 954 groups that the Alabama-based law center counted in 2017.\n\nHeidi Beirich, director of the law center's Intelligence Project, said the count reflects an \"enlivened American hate movement\" that has been growing for the past four years.\n\n\"This time period dovetails with (Donald) Trump's campaign and then his presidency, a period that has seen a 30 percent increase in the number of these groups,\" she said. \"In the three years prior to that, during the waning years of (Barack Obama's) presidency, hate groups were actually on the decline.\"\n\nSome organizations on the list have criticized or even sued over the hate-group labels, accusing the law center of political bias.\n\nThe law center, based in Montgomery, Alabama, defines a hate group as an organization that attacks or maligns an entire class of people. Beirich said the law center stands by its designations and denied its list unfairly targets conservative groups.\n\n\"I've never thought of it as a conservative position to defend, for example, defaming gay men as being child molesters or pedophiles. The kind of speech that we call out is of that nature. It's defamatory. It's negative propaganda,\" she said.\n\nLiberty Counsel Inc., a Florida-based legal advocacy organization, sued after a website that maintains a charity database flagged it and 45 other nonprofits for being labeled as hate groups by the law center. A federal judge in Virginia threw out that lawsuit. A federal magistrate in Alabama recommended the dismissal of a separate lawsuit that accused the law center of defaming a Florida-based evangelical ministry by designating it as a hate group.\n\nThe number of white nationalist groups counted by the law center increased from 100 chapters in 2017 to 148 in 2018.

Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried \u201csystematic racism,\u201d and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn\u2019t add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism.

Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.\n\nKansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the \u201cnoose\u201d was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who \u201cmay have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.\u201d\n\nMichigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident.

But it turned out the \u201cnoose\u201d was a \u201cpackaged leather shoelace\u201d that someone had dropped accidentally.\n\nSmithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of \u201cnooses\u201d lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institution museums the \u201clatest in a string of hate incidents\u201d after Trump\u2019s election. The African-American museum director called them a \u201creminder of America\u2019s dark history.\u201d But the museums refused to release surveillance video, and my public-records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.\n\nMississippi State Capitol, 2018.

But he refuted reports that he told police the attackers wore MAGA hats, a reference to President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan.\n\nSmollett's initial status as a crime victim began to shift last weekend after police arrested and interviewed two brothers who were originally identified as suspects after turning up in surveillance footage.\n\nThe brothers told detectives that Smollett, who employed one as a personal trainer, paid them to stage the assault. A search warrant for their residences also turned up a receipt for the rope that was placed around Smollett's neck.\n\nOn Wednesday, Guglielmi said Smollett had finally complied with their request for a follow-up interview with detectives and prosecutors, but did not say what was discussed. Smollett's lawyers attended the meeting but the actor himself did not.\n\nBecause Smollett, 36, was charged with filing a false police report, he stands the chance of not only losing his career but being ordered to pay restitution to compensate the Chicago Police Department to cover the cost of their investigation.\n\nAndrew Stoltmann, a criminal defense attorney in Cook County, said filing a false police report may be charged as a misdemeanor or a felony under Illinois law.

Well, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.\u201d\n\nSanders will face opposition from moderate Democrats and from Republicans who are likely to use his candidacy to paint the party as too liberal. In a preview of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, the president used his State of the Union speech this month to warn against what he said was the creep of socialism in America.\n\nTrump 2020 campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement: \u201cBernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism.\n\n\u201cBut the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.\u201d\n\nSanders made clear on Tuesday that he plans to go after Trump directly in his campaign.\n\nIn an interview with Vermont Public Radio, where he first announced his bid, he said: \u201cI think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country. I think he is a pathological liar. I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.\u201d\n\nAfter a midterm election cycle that saw women and minority candidates sweep to power, the nominating contest is likely to be fought not only over ideology but over identity and electoral strategy. Already, the 2020 candidates are being pushed on how they can appeal to the Democrats\u2019 broad range of demographic groups, which includes working-class families, black and Latino voters, suburban women and young people.\n\nThis year, Sanders apologized publicly and privately to former female staffers after allegations of sexual harassment by male staffers on his 2016 campaign. He has also continued to stumble on questions about race, despite a years-long effort to improve his standing with minority voters.\n\nStill, no candidate will enter the race with as many advantages as Sanders, who ended the 2016 primary with more than 13m votes and nearly $230m raised, much of it through small donations. Now he begins a second run not as a political outsider but as a top-tier candidate with near-universal name recognition, a dedicated following and an unrivaled donor list."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/chuck-schumer-bernie-sanders-plan-113043990.html", "text": "Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Bernie Sanders of Vermont want to penalize \u201cself-indulgent\u201d corporations that buy back their own stock. In a recent article in the New York Times,they argued that when companies repurchase shares, not only do the vast majority of Americans not benefit, but income inequality is exacerbated since only wealthy shareholders and corporate management profit.\n\nDespite decades of extraordinary success that the United States has enjoyed and that we enjoy today, Schumer and Sanders believe that something sinister is taking place in the corporate world. They call buybacks a form of \u201ccorporate self-indulgence.\u201d Why? Because\n\ncorporate boardrooms have become obsessed with maximizing only shareholder earnings to the detriment of workers and the long-term strength of their companies. . . . Companies, rather than investing in ways to make their businesses more resilient or their workers more productive, have been dedicating ever larger shares of their profits to dividends and corporate repurchases.\n\nNow even some Republicans are getting on board. Florida senator Marco Rubio has suggested changes in the tax law to discourage buybacks because he says they \u201cinflate\u201d the prices of stock \u201cat the expense of future productivity & job creation.\u201d\n\nRelated Video: Bernie Sanders Faces New Hurdles in 2020\n\nFor more news videos visit Yahoo View.\n\nThese senators don\u2019t seem to fully understand that the purpose of a business is to allocate resources in a way that maximizes per share results over the long run. To think that this can be achieved at the expense of workers, at the expense of investing in research, at the expense of developing new and better products, at the expense of investing in equipment to both lower the cost and increase the quality of production, etc. is sophomoric. This underscores their lack of knowledge about investing and financial markets.\n\nCompanies have several options with regard to the use of excess cash. They can (1) retain the funds in the company, (2) invest in the capital needed to grow the company, (3) make acquisitions, (4) pay out the excess cash in the form of dividends, or (5) repurchase shares from existing shareholders.\n\nThese senators see little value in share buybacks, but they should listen to Warren Buffett, who is unequivocally a long-term investor. His financial success is a result of making exceptional long-term investments in resilient companies. Unlike Schumer and Sanders, Buffett is an enthusiastic proponent of utilizing excess cash to repurchase shares when conditions are favorable (or opportune).\n\nHere is what he said in his 1984 annual report: \u201cThe companies in which we have our largest investments are all engaged in significant share repurchases at the times when a wide discrepancy exists between price and value.\u201d He has made this point repeatedly throughout the years. These companies repurchase shares and continue to grow, continue to invest in research, in capital that will improve the quality and lower the cost of products. He has even bought back $1 billion of shares of his own company, Berkshire Hathaway, not because he is \u201cself-indulgent\u201d but because he thinks the firm is undervalued.\n\nSchumer and Sanders\u2014and in some cases they are joined by Rubio\u2014provide two main reasons we are in a stock buyback \u201ccrisis\u201d:\n\nFirst, stock buybacks don\u2019t benefit the vast majority of Americans. Second, when corporations direct resources to buy back shares on this scale, they restrain their capacity to reinvest profits more meaningfully in the company in terms of R&D, equipment, higher wages, paid medical leave, retirement benefits and worker retraining.\n\nThe first point is utter nonsense. More than 100 million average Americans own stock. Americans invest in mutual funds and index funds and buy and sell stock every day. Tens of millions more have 401K plans, and most union pension funds have hundreds of billions of dollars invested in stocks.\n\nThe second point is equally absurd. A corporate board of directors is elected by shareholders, the owners of the company. When a board makes the decision to repurchase shares, it is a sign of confidence in the firm\u2019s long-term profitability. It raises share values, which obviously benefits shareholders and puts firms in better financial shape \u2014 which also benefits the employees. Essentially, Schumer and Sanders believe, and Rubio seems to believe, that they have the right to tell the owners of a corporation the best way to allocate their profits."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/colbert-bernies-trump-obsession-best-180509492.html", "text": "Bernie Sanders is running for president, and he's already criticizing Trump.

Berreth, 29, was reported missing by her mother on December 2nd, but hasn\u2019t been seen or heard from since Thanksgiving Day. Investigators have not recovered a body, but court documents released after Frazee\u2019s arrest in December indicated that prosecutors believe the Woodland Park mother was killed that day. At a preliminary hearing on Tuesday, testimony from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation revealed the gruesome details of Berreth\u2019s alleged murder \u2014 according to Frazee\u2019s lover, an Idaho nurse who admitted to police that she helped dispose of Berreth\u2019s body.\n\nAfter Berreth was reported missing in early December, Frazee told police he saw his ex on Thanksgiving afternoon, when he picked up their one-year-old daughter, and last heard from her when she texted him three days later, on November 25th. But according to Teller County prosecutors, Thanksgiving night, Berreth\u2019s cell phone pinged several cell towers in the vicinity of Frazee\u2019s ranch in Florissant. The phone\u2019s last activity was on November 25th, but it pinged a tower in Gooding, Idaho, more than 700 miles away. Frazee was arrested on December 21st and charged 10 days later \u201cwith two counts of murder in the first degree and three counts of solicitation to commit murder in the first degree,\u201d the first indication that prosecutors believed someone else was involved.\n\nAccording to NBC News, unsealed charging documents revealed that Frazee allegedly tried \u201cto find someone to kill his fianc\u00e9e three times between September and November,\u201d and in early January, reports surfaced that an Idaho nurse named Krystal Lee Kenney was being investigated in connection with Berreth\u2019s disappearance. On February 8th, Kenney made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to felony tampering and to testify again Frazee, her lover of nearly a year. In a prepared statement, Kenney said that she learned Frazee \u201chad committed a homicide,\u201d and knowing \u201cthat law enforcement would be investigating that crime,\u201d she \u201cmoved the victim\u2019s cellphone with the intent to impair the phone\u2019s availability in the investigation.\u201d\n\nTestifying in court on Tuesday, Colorado Bureau of Investigations Agent Gregg Slater revealed just how much Kenney claimed to know about Berreth\u2019s murder and Frazee\u2019s involvement. According to the Denver Post\u2019s account of Slater\u2019s testimony, Kenney told investigators that Frazee told her that Berreth was abusive to their daughter, and then, on three separate occasions, he asked Kenney to kill Berreth \u201cto protect the innocent.\u201d In September 2018, Kenney said she pretended to be new to the neighborhood when she knocked on Berreth\u2019s door and offered her a cup of her favorite Starbucks coffee drink \u2014 but said she couldn\u2019t bring herself to poison the brew like Frazee had wanted. On two occasions in October, Kenney said Frazee asked her to beat Berreth to death \u2014 first, with a metal pipe he provided, and then with a baseball bat \u2014 and to dump her body in a dumpster; Kenney said she drove to Berreth\u2019s home both times, but couldn\u2019t follow through. That\u2019s when Frazee allegedly told her, \u201cI guess if you can\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll have to do it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Slater\u2019s testimony, on November 22nd, Frazee allegedly called Kenney and said, \u201cYou need to get out here now. You got a mess to clean up.\u201d On November 24th, Kenney packed her car with a full-body hazardous materials suit, a hair net, a box of plastic gloves, slip-on booties and bleach, and drove to Frazee\u2019s ranch to pick up a key before proceeding to Berreth\u2019s townhouse. The scene inside was horrific, Kenney allegedly told investigators, and it took her four hours to clean up all the blood.

It's not serious,\" he said.\n\nSuch claims were rejected by Macron, who said legitimate criticism of Israel would remain protected.\n\nBut he said police and judges would now be better able to combat \"the fundamental hatred of Jews that hides behind the rejection of Israel, the refusal of its right to exist.\"\n\n- 'Killing people' -\n\nMacron also vowed to study reports that Jewish parents have \"too often\" resorted to pulling their children from public schools in some areas because of insults or threats.\n\n\"Such departures from our schools say something, at times about what we don't want or cannot see,\" he said.\n\nMacron also said authorities would move more forcefully to shut down racist groups, beginning with three far-right ones -- Bastion Social, Blood and Honour Hexagone, and Combat 18.\n\nOfficials accuse both far-right and far-left extremists of infiltrating the \"yellow vest\" anti-government protests that started in November.\n\nIn recent weeks, the protests have coincided with a spate of anti-Semitic vandalism.\n\nThe insults and violence aren't new, however, with the interior ministry announcing this month a 74 percent surge in anti-Semitic offences last year, after two years of declines.\n\nThe violence in recent years has included murders such as the brutal killing last year of 85-year-old Holocaust survivor Mirielle Knoll.\n\n\"Once again... anti-Semitism is killing people in France,\" Macron warned."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/lower-tax-refunds-show-republican-184826196.html", "text": "The size of your tax refund has nothing to do with your overall tax bill.

Slowly, it will destroy America, too.\n\nThe federal budget deficit is soaring, and you can blame it all on Republican tax cuts\n\nIs Donald Trump smart on taxes, or a clever tax con man who committed 'outright fraud'?\n\nNever mind that the size of average tax refunds varies from year to year in the U.S. \u2013 Morgan Stanley estimates total refunds will actually increase this year by 26 percent, or $62 billion.\n\nSet aside that the Treasury data is merely the first few weeks of a very unusual tax season due to the partial government shutdown. And ignore the important fact that refunds which include tax credits from earned income and additional child credits aren\u2019t reflected in these initial reports.\n\nThis claim about refunds, as the Washington Post\u2019s fact checker observed, is \u201cnonsensical and misleading.\u201d\n\nThey were describing Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 tweet, in which she purported that the size of the average tax refund is slightly down from last year, calling Republican\u2019s tax cuts a \u201cmiddle-class tax hike.\u201d She earned four Pinocchios for such a bizarre claim.\n\nRefunds are lower because taxes are lower\n\nHere are the straight facts.\n\nThe size of your tax refund has nothing to do with your overall tax bill. It merely reflects what you overpaid the IRS in your paychecks last year.\n\nFor most Americans, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivered larger paychecks starting last February, even if many workers didn\u2019t notice. The liberal Tax Policy Center confirms that 90 percent of middle-class Americans will receive a tax cut.\n\nSince many workers and families live paycheck-to-paycheck, getting at least some of their tax cut in advance, rather than delaying it a year, is a life saver.\n\nA larger paycheck throughout the year is especially important for that family of two teachers and two kids in Texas who \u2014 thanks to the GOP tax cuts \u2014 keep $2,636 more of their earnings each year to help pay utilities, the truck payment, or save for college.\n\nIt\u2019s equally crucial for the single mom with two kids in Iowa who doesn\u2019t pay a dime in federal income taxes on the first $53,000 of her hard-earned money. That means more money for groceries and getting her kids into the sports they love. And more money that can go to the credit card bill, which means less interest paid to the credit card company.\n\nYou get to control your money. Not the IRS.\n\nThanks to the tax cuts, led by President Trump, the Child Tax Credit is doubled and available to millions more parents, the standard deduction nearly doubled, tax rates were lowered at every income level, and over 90 percent of Americans will be able to use the simplest available tax form \u2014 without the hassle of itemizing."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/debunking-between-refund-checks-total-152400552.html", "text": "The average tax refund might be smaller this year than it was at this point in 2018, but that doesn't mean you paid more in taxes.\n\nWatch TV shows, movies and more on Yahoo View.\n\nAbout Newsy\n\nBe informed.

Some are getting refunds that are half their normal size, while others are thousands of dollars in the hole for the first time.\n\nTo manage, they are readjusting their spending plans to align with a smaller refund.

The share of returns getting a refund is also slightly lower than a year ago.

Many prefer the money returned to them as a big check in the spring. The forced savings helps them preserve a predictable windfall, one they can\u2019t dip into during the year.\n\nPast taxpayer surveys show they use that money to reduce debt, pad savings or pay for a vacation or other large purchases. Overall, about three-fourths of taxpayers get a refund, which last year averaged just under $3,000.\n\nJennifer and Daniel Yuen planned to use their refund to support their oldest daughter, who moved to Washington, D.C., to train with the Washington Ballet. The couple pay for her tuition and rent.\n\nLast year, they got almost $800 back.

(Maxim Shemetov/Pool Photo via AP File)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Call it the aid wars.\n\nThe Trump administration is accusing President Nicolas Maduro of starving Venezuelans by blocking tons of American-supplied humanitarian aid stored next door in Colombia.\n\nIn Russia, the Kremlin sees the opposition's plan to ram the aid across the border as a reckless pretext for ordering a U.S. military intervention.\n\nAs tensions in Venezuela mount ahead of a Saturday showdown over humanitarian aid, both sides are digging in, highlighting how the South American nation's crisis has become the latest fault line in a battle for global influence by the former Cold War adversaries.\n\nAt stake is the future of Venezuela, a once oil-rich country gripped by hyperinflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine. Opposition leader Juan Guaido last month declared himself the country's rightful president, a claim backed by the U.S. and dozens of other nations that argue Maduro's re-election last year was fraudulent because several opposition candidates were barred from running.\n\nRussia, long a staunch Maduro ally, has remained firmly behind the socialist leader.\n\nRussian state news agencies said Wednesday that a Russian shipment of medicine and medical equipment had arrived in Venezuela. The reports did not give the size of the shipment or say what it contained, though they cited a diplomatic source as saying the delivery was made under the aegis of the World Health Organization.\n\nHours earlier Maduro had said 300 tons of medicine and other aid was on its way from Russia.\n\nCarlos Romero, an international affairs professor at the Central University of Venezuela, said that Russia's support for Maduro is more symbolic than consequential when compared to the intense pressure against the government being exerted by the U.S. in what he called \"Washington's backyard.\"\n\nStill, he said the two global powers were on a collision course in Venezuela, making it harder to negotiate a de-escalation of tensions.\n\n\"The fate of Venezuela is in the hands of outsiders,\" said Romero, who has advised Venezuela's opposition in the past. \"It's like two trains heading toward one another on the same track and every day that passes they gain speed.\"\n\nGuaido has called for \"caravans\" of tens of thousands of Venezuelans to join forces Saturday to carry the U.S. aid from Colombia into Venezuela, despite Maduro's objections and the barricading of a key bridge linking Venezuela and the Colombian border city of Cucuta, where the aid is stored.\n\nOn Wednesday, Puerto Rico also announced it had dispatched a boat carrying 250 tons of aid earmarked for Venezuela, while Brazil's far-right government said it would send supplies to the jungled northern state of Roraima on Saturday as well. Neither said how it expected to deliver the aid into Venezuela.\n\nThe Kremlin has compared the move to the deadly unrest movement in the Ukraine in 2013 that pushed out a pro-Russian president.\n\n\"If the organizers really want to just deliver some kind of humanitarian aid to the needy, why not use the specialized U.N. agencies that have extensive and invaluable experience in carrying out such operations?\" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.\n\nForeign Minister Sergey Lavrov reaffirmed strong criticism of Washington's policy on Venezuela, saying Wednesday that calls this week by President Donald Trump on the Venezuelan military to drop support for Maduro represent a flagrant violation of international law.\n\n\"This is undoubtedly a direct violation of the U.N. Charter and a direct intervention into the domestic affairs of an independent country,\" Lavrov said. \"When you listen to some representatives of the U.S. administration, it seems that diplomacy is simply ignored.\"\n\nLavrov said he hopes \"reason will prevail\" and the Venezuelan opposition will engage in talks with Maduro to resolve the crisis. He noted a strong opposition in the region to U.S. military interference.\n\nDmitry Rozental, a deputy head of the Russian state-funded Institute for Latin America in Moscow, said that the Kremlin will continue to offer political support for Maduro \u2014 but while carefully weighing its actions.\n\n\"Russia will offer moral support, humanitarian aid and some economic assistance,\" he said.

Hoda Muthana was born in New Jersey on October 28 of that year and the family later settled in Hoover, Alabama, a prosperous suburb of Birmingham.\n\nThe State Department initially questioned Hoda Muthana's right to citizenship when her father sought a passport for her as a child because US records showed he had been a diplomat until February 1995, the lawsuit said.\n\nBut it said that the State Department accepted a letter from the US mission to the United Nations that affirmed that he had ended his position before his daughter's birth and granted her a passport.\n\nThe lawsuit said that Hoda Muthana was also entitled to citizenship due to her mother as she became a US permanent resident, anticipating the loss of diplomatic status, in July 1994.\n\nAhmed Ali Muthana additionally asked for the right to send money to support his daughter and grandson, who are being held by US-allied Kurdish fighters at the forefront of fighting the Islamic State militants.\n\nShe furtively went to Syria in 2014 when the Islamic State group was carrying out a grisly campaign of beheadings and mass rape and turned to social media to praise the killings of Westerners.\n\n- 'She's not coming back' -\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was named in the lawsuit along with Trump, in a terse statement Wednesday said that Hoda Muthana was not a citizen.\n\nPompeo did not outline the legal rationale but in an interview Thursday, asked if the key issue was that her father had been a diplomat, Pompeo said, \"That's right.\"\n\n\"She may have been born here. She is not a US citizen, nor is she entitled to US citizenship,\" Pompeo told NBC television's \"Today\" show.\n\nIn a separate interview with the Fox Business Network, Pompeo dismissed the \"heart-strings\" pitch in Muthana's pleas to return home.\n\n\"This is a woman who inflicted enormous risk on American soldiers, on American citizens. She is a terrorist. She's not coming back,\" he said.\n\nIt is extremely difficult for the United States to strip a person of citizenship, a step taken by Britain in the case of homegrown jihadists.\n\nTrump's order on Muthana came even though he is pushing other Western countries to bring back hundreds of jihadists to prosecute at home as the United States prepares to withdraw troops from Syria."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/pompeo-denies-isis-bride-request-201315534.html", "text": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that an Alabama woman who fled to Syria to join ISIS in 2014 is not a U.S. citizen and, as a result, is not entitled to return to the U.S. with her 18-month-old son, as she had hoped to do.\n\n\u201cMs. Hoda Muthana is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement. \u201cShe does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States.

Coulter, with 2.14 million Twitter followers (compared to Trump\u2019s 57.9 million) appears to wield an outsized influence over the White House, and she wasn\u2019t shy in discussing it in her interview with Yahoo News\u2019 Dan Klaidman and Michael Isikoff.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s none of your beeswax,\u201d she said, when asked if she is still talking to the president despite their seemingly frayed relationship.\n\nIn an interview last week, Trump remarked of Coulter, \u201cI hear she\u2019s become very hostile.

The effect of his presidency, along with the #MeToo uprising and the simplifying effect of social media, has been to bifurcate the culture, with white men assumed to be on one side and most everyone else on the other.\n\nAnd now the left has re-embraced identity \u2014 race, gender, sexuality \u2014 as its chief organizing principle, too.\n\nRebutting the political theorist Francis Fukuyama in Foreign Affairs (an odd place for this debate, but such is the state of our politics), Stacey Abrams, the almost-governor of Georgia, offered an eloquent and much-praised defense of identity politics, arguing that the Democratic Party ought to mainly be a place where marginalized groups can amplify their collective power.\n\nThis first wave of presidential hopefuls has heard the call, too. Kamala Harris announced her candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday, in case anyone missed the significance of her candidacy. Kirsten Gillibrand has put feminism front and center as a rationale.\n\nElizabeth Warren has experienced the hard road of the Native American. Or at least she once drove a Cherokee Sport.\n\nBut then you have the unlikely candidacy of 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, who would rather talk about his record as the two-term mayor of South Bend, Ind., or about his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a Rhodes scholar and a combat veteran, than about his identity as the first openly gay man to seek the Democratic nomination.\n\nAt a moment when other candidates are talking endlessly about the historical resonance of their candidacies, Buttigieg seems bent on relegating his to a subtext. Which makes his campaign intriguing \u2014 and, if you ask me, underestimated.\n\nIf you\u2019re assuming that Buttigieg is only de-emphasizing his personal identity now because he wants to seem more electable to the masses, then you don\u2019t know much about Buttigieg (and, really, there\u2019s no reason you should).\n\nAs it happens, Buttigieg was an undergraduate at Harvard when I taught a seminar there about 17 years ago. I knew him then, but I got to know him much better later, when he was embarking on a political career, and we had some long conversations about how to handle those jackals in the press corps.\n\nButtigieg was in his 30s and already serving as mayor when he came to terms with his own sexuality and met the man he would marry. What he struggled with then wasn\u2019t whether to come out publicly (he never had any intention of hiding and felt the voters should hear it directly from him) but rather how to keep his sexuality from defining him as a politician.\n\nButtigieg had no interest in becoming known as \u201cthe gay mayor in Indiana,\u201d or in transforming himself into a spokesman for the cause. He wanted to be the rising Democratic star who, by the way, happened also to be gay.\n\nWe talked then about President Obama \u2014 about how he had eschewed the politics of racial resentment, how he had been secure enough to discuss the political novelty of being black without letting it become the only thing he was. It was much the same way that John Kennedy, nearly 50 years earlier, had made Catholic identity a part of his political identity, but not the only thing people saw.\n\nButtigieg understood, even then, that the time was coming when being gay wouldn\u2019t be any different from being Catholic or being black in each of those moments. Some people might hold identity against you, sure, but even more of them would admire you for pushing past it and focusing on commonalities instead.\n\nNow Buttigieg is holding firm to that ideal, even if the moment has come back around to a place where it might seem more advantageous, in a Democratic primary, to lead with his own sense of alienation from the power structure. He leads, instead, with his experience as mayor."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-doesn-t-know-163933413.html?.tsrc=jtc_news_index", "text": "News that the Trump administration is planning to launch a global campaign to end the criminalization of homosexuality caught some by surprise this week \u2015 and, from the looks of it, the president may have been one of them.\n\nNBC\u2019s Josh Lederman outlined the State Department\u2019s campaign in a bombshell report Tuesday.

On 26 July 2017, President Trump announced on Twitter that transgender individuals would not be allowed to serve \u201cin any capacity\u201d in the US Military.\n\n5.

Her lawyer is challenging that claim.\n\nIn a brief statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave no details as to how the administration made their determination.\n\n\"Ms. Hoda Muthana is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States,\" he said. \"She does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport nor any visa to travel to the United States.\"\n\nBut Hassan Shibly, a lawyer for the woman, insisted Muthana was born in the United States and had a valid passport before she joined the Islamic State in 2014. He says she has renounced the terrorist group and wants to come home to protect her 18-month-old son regardless of the legal consequences.\n\n\"She's an American. Americans break the law,\" said Shibly, a lawyer with the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \"When people break the law, we have a legal system to handle those kinds of situations to hold people accountable, and that's all she's asking for.\"\n\nMuthana and her son are now in a refugee camp in Syria, along with others who fled the remnants of the Islamic State.\n\nShibly said that the administration argues that she didn't qualify for citizenship because her father was a Yemeni diplomat. But the lawyer said her father had not had diplomatic status at the time of her birth in Hackensack, New Jersey.\n\nHe released a copy of the woman's birth certificate, issued two months after her birth on Oct. 28, 1994, to support his claim.\n\nThe lawyer also provided to The Associated Press a letter from the U.S. Mission to the United Nations to what was then known as the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services attesting to the fact that the woman's father, Ahmed Ali Muthana, was a member of the Yemeni diplomatic mission to the U.N. from Oct. 15, 1990 to Sept. 1, 1994.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday on Twitter that he was behind the decision to deny her entry, tweeting that \"I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!\"\n\nThe announcement came a day after Britain said that it was stripping the citizenship of Shamima Begum, a 19-year-old who left the country in 2015 with two friends to join the Islamic State and recently gave birth in a refugee camp.\n\nIt also comes as the U.S. has urged allies to back citizens who joined IS but are now in the custody of the American-backed forces fighting the remnants of the brutally extremist group that once controlled a vast area spanning parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nMuthana's lawyer said she was \"just a stupid, naive, young dumb woman,\" when she became enamored of Islamic State, believing it was an organization that protected Muslims.\n\nShibly said she fled her family in Alabama and made her way to Syria, where she was \"brainwashed\" by IS and compelled to marry one of the group's soldiers. After he was killed, she married another, the father of her son.\n\nAfter her second husband was also killed she married a third IS fighter but she \"became disenchanted with the marriage,\" and decided to escape, the lawyer said.\n\nShibly, based in Tampa, Florida, said he intends to file a legal challenge to the government's decision to deny her entry to the country.\n\nMuthana's status had been considered by lawyers from the departments of State and Justice since her case arose, according to one U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official would not elaborate but said Pompeo's statement was based on the lawyers' conclusions.\n\nThe State Department declined to disclose details about her father or Muthana's case, citing privacy law.\n\nMost people born in the United States are accorded so-called birthright citizenship, but there are exceptions. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person born in the U.S. to an accredited foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to U.S. law and is not automatically considered a U.S. citizen at birth.\n\nHowever, Muthana's case is unusual, if not unprecedented in that she once held a U.S. passport. Passports are only issued to citizens by birth or naturalization, according to Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, who has studied the phenomenon of foreign Islamic State fighters and families."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/new-independent-group-mps-already-polling-high-expected-join-085643111.html?.tsrc=jtc_news_index", "text": "The new Independent Group of MPs has already polled with 14% of voters\u2019 support, according to YouGov (Picture: Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire)\n\nThe new Independent Group of MPs has already won the support of 14% of voters, a new YouGov poll has revealed.\n\nThe YouGov voter intention poll asked the public how they would vote if the Independent Group became a political party and put up candidates at the general election.\n\nIt found that 14% would support the new group, while the Conservatives had 38% of the vote, Labour 26% and the Liberal Democrats 7%.\n\nThe difference is not necessarily down to voters switching allegiance to the new, as-yet unformed, political party, YouGov said, but because many Labour voters said they didn\u2019t know who they would vote for in that situation.\n\nYouGov also said it was important to bear in mind that the poll was carried out on Monday and Tuesday when the Independent Group was made up only of former Labour MPs and the defection of several Conservative MPs on Wednesday could affect how the group is seen.\n\nMORE: Donald Trump bars Alabama woman who joined Isis from returning to the United States\n\nMORE: Home Secretary says he \u2018would not make someone stateless\u2019 \u2013 days after stripping Isis bride of UK citizenship\n\nTweeting the results of the poll, Henry Zeffman, political correspondent at The Times, also pointed out that one in five people who voted for Labour in 2017 had said they would switch to the Independent Group.\n\nThe poll results come as turbulence was set to continue in Westminster, with warnings that more people could join The Independent Group.\n\nFormer Conservative Sarah Wollaston claimed that a third of the Cabinet could walk out if it appeared that Theresa May could steer Britain towards a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSouth Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen agreed, saying that around 100 of her former Tory colleagues were as frustrated as she was, telling ITV\u2019s Peston that \u201ca third of the party\u201d shared her views.\n\n\u2014Watch the latest videos from Yahoo UK\u2014"}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-denies-asked-acting-ag-104734594.html?.tsrc=jtc_news_index", "text": "President Donald Trump is pushing back against a New York Times report that he asked acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker if he could replace the prosecutor investigating Michael Cohen."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/weather", "text": "Friday\n\n0 %\n\n77 \u00b0 49 \u00b0\n\nMostly cloudy with a high of 76 \u00b0F (24.4 \u00b0C).

That puts the movie, Wandering Earth, on par with some of the biggest big screen titles to emerge from the US in recent years, like Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nThe movie, a sci-fi epic that tells the story of people trying to save earth from being destroyed by the sun, is already the second-highest grossing film in China ever. Which should explain why Netflix just snatched it up, in a deal that will introduce the film to an even wider audience via the popular streaming giant.\n\nRelated: How Netflix Changed the Oscars with 'Roma'\n\nThe streamer didn\u2019t share any other details about the arrangement, like how much it paid or when the film will start streaming. But it\u2019s still a big announcement, for multiple reasons.\n\nFor one thing, this will help acclimate global audiences to Chinese-produced fare. It\u2019s also a win-win for Netflix \u2014 which, while it doesn\u2019t sell subscriptions inside China, is nevertheless making a push to appeal to global Chinese audiences. In addition to this film, Netflix is also developing its first Chinese-language original TV series.\n\nAs far as Wandering Earth goes, it\u2019s definitely an understatement to say a ton of work went into this blockbuster. According to Netflix, the film was given a production scale rarely seen in Chinese films and included post-production and special effects work that took two years. That included more than 10,000 specifically-built props and the employment of some 2,000 special effects shots, in addition to a \u201csubstantial amount of computer graphics shots.\u201d\n\n\u201cAudiences from over 190 countries will soon meet The Wandering Earth on Netflix,\u201d the film\u2019s director Frant Gwo said in a statement about the news, also raving about Netflix\u2019s plan to translate it into 28 languages. \u201cI am glad that our movie can reach to people from different parts of the world. This is a Chinese movie created for the world, and it has been positively received since its premiere.

A team of heroes builds \u201cten thousand stellar engines\u201d to propel earth out of the solar system in the hope of finding a new home in space, kick-starting a 2,500-year-long journey in which humanity fights for the survival of their \u201cwandering earth.\u201d\n\nBGR Top Deals:\n\nTrending Right Now:\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com"}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/netflix-lands-wandering-earth-sci-072526396.html", "text": "Netflix has acquired Chinese sci-fi blockbuster The Wandering Earth, taking global SVOD rights excluding Mainland China.

In a prepared statement, Kenney said that she learned Frazee \u201chad committed a homicide,\u201d and knowing \u201cthat law enforcement would be investigating that crime,\u201d she \u201cmoved the victim\u2019s cellphone with the intent to impair the phone\u2019s availability in the investigation.\u201d\n\nView photos\n\nTestifying in court on Tuesday, Colorado Bureau of Investigations Agent Gregg Slater revealed just how much Kenney claimed to know about Berreth\u2019s murder and Frazee\u2019s involvement. According to the Denver Post\u2019s account of Slater\u2019s testimony, Kenney told investigators that Frazee told her that Berreth was abusive to their daughter, and then, on three separate occasions, he asked Kenney to kill Berreth \u201cto protect the innocent.\u201d In September 2018, Kenney said she pretended to be new to the neighborhood when she knocked on Berreth\u2019s door and offered her a cup of her favorite Starbucks coffee drink \u2014 but said she couldn\u2019t bring herself to poison the brew like Frazee had wanted. On two occasions in October, Kenney said Frazee asked her to beat Berreth to death \u2014 first, with a metal pipe he provided, and then with a baseball bat \u2014 and to dump her body in a dumpster; Kenney said she drove to Berreth\u2019s home both times, but couldn\u2019t follow through. That\u2019s when Frazee allegedly told her, \u201cI guess if you can\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll have to do it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Slater\u2019s testimony, on November 22nd, Frazee allegedly called Kenney and said, \u201cYou need to get out here now. You got a mess to clean up.\u201d On November 24th, Kenney packed her car with a full-body hazardous materials suit, a hair net, a box of plastic gloves, slip-on booties and bleach, and drove to Frazee\u2019s ranch to pick up a key before proceeding to Berreth\u2019s townhouse. The scene inside was horrific, Kenney allegedly told investigators, and it took her four hours to clean up all the blood. Anything that couldn\u2019t be cleaned was stuffed into trash bags and tossed; a whole tooth, roots and all, went in the garbage as well."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/gma/details-case-missing-colorado-mom-213327668.html", "text": "Cindy Crawford says her husband 'hates' when she wears makeup as she shares her easy beauty routine"}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/khlo-kardashian-posts-heartbreaking-messages-161756876.html", "text": "James: Jack Salt attends the University of Virginia, the school Thomas Jefferson chartered in 1819.

This compares to earnings of $0.35 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.88%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this business development company would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.36, delivering a surprise of 5.88%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nSolar Senior, which belongs to the Zacks Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry industry, posted revenues of $9.98 million for the quarter ended December 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.15%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $9.05 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nSolar Senior shares have added about 10.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for Solar Senior?\n\nWhile Solar Senior has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Solar Senior was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.34 on $10.70 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.41 on $45.60 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry is currently in the top 29% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.\n\nUniversal Electronics (UEIC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.70 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.74 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.60 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -5.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this remote control maker would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering no surprise.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.\n\nUniversal Electronics, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry, posted revenues of $170.30 million for the quarter ended December 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.45%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $181.15 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nUniversal Electronics shares have added about 14.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for Universal Electronics?\n\nWhile Universal Electronics has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Universal Electronics was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.61 on $172.93 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.79 on $739.07 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Miscellaneous Products is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As they do, twelve empty supertankers are also revealing a few truths about today\u2019s global oil market.\n\nIn normal times, the vessels would be filled with heavy, high sulfur Middle East oil for delivery to refineries in places like Houston or New Orleans. Not now though. They are sailing cargo-less, a practice that vessel owners normally try to avoid because ships earn money by making deliveries.\n\nThe 12 vessels are making voyages of as much as 21,000 miles direct from Asia, all the way around South Africa, holding nothing but seawater for stability because Middle East producers are restricting supplies. Still, America\u2019s booming volumes of light crude must still be exported, and there aren\u2019t enough supertankers in the Atlantic Ocean for the job. So they\u2019re coming empty.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s driving this is a U.S. oil market that\u2019s looking relatively bearish with domestic production estimates trending higher, and persistent crude oil builds we have seen for the last few weeks,\u201d said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam. \u201cAt the same time, OPEC cuts are supporting international grades like Brent, creating an export incentive.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. both exports and imports large amounts of crude because the variety it pumps -- especially newer supplies from shale formations -- is very different from the type that\u2019s found in the Middle East. OPEC members are likely cutting heavier grades while American exports are predominantly lighter, Patterson said.\n\nGasoline Glut\n\nBy industry standards, American oil is considered light and low in sulfur, making it great for churning out gasoline, with the result that a glut of the automotive fuel is starting to build up. By contrast, Middle East crude often needs more processing -- not a problem for Gulf of Mexico plants that were designed specifically for that task -- but it can have a smaller gasoline yield.\n\n\u201cThere is still going to be a lot of growth from U.S. tight oil this year,\u201d said James Davis, director of short-term global oil service at Facts Global Energy. \u201cThis will continue to push U.S. exports up.\u201d\n\nShippers are counting on the U.S. exports to help the tanker market withstand supply restrictions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia. Industry analysts, who actually raised their estimates for what they think the ships will earn this year after the OPEC+ pact was announced in December, are citing rising American shipments as a contributing factor.\n\nThere are usually three or four empty supertankers -- very large crude carriers in industry jargon -- that would sail empty to the U.S. at any one time, according to shipbrokers.\n\nThe shift has produced knock-on effects around the shipping market. Daily earnings for the VLCCs, which can haul two million barrels of oil, on the benchmark Middle East-to-China route doubled since last week to $29,494, according to Baltic Exchange data.\n\n\u201cFollowing a fixing frenzy from the U.S. Gulf Coast late last week, most available tonnage in the Atlantic basin has been soaked up,\u201d said Espen Fjermestad, an analyst at Fearnley Securities AS in Oslo. \u201cWith ships ballasting West, rates have shifted up also in the East.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from David Marino, Alex Longley, Zimri Smith and Julian Lee.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Firat Kayakiran in London at fkayakiran@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaric Nightingale at anightingal1@bloomberg.net, John Deane\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-shares-tread-water-investors-005200242.html", "text": "Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 22, 2019.

China said on Friday that imports would continue, but customs has stepped up checks on foreign cargoes.\n\nSeparate comments by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe that a rate increase may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar.\n\nThe Aussie dollar recently gained 0.56 percent versus the greenback at 0.7128.\n\nDespite gains on risky assets, safe-haven U.S. Treasuries also gained in price.

Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS\n\nBy Jeff Mason\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China have started to outline commitments in principle on the stickiest issues in their trade dispute, marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThe world's two largest economies have slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, slowing global economic growth, skewing supply chains and disrupting manufacturing.\n\nAs officials hold high-level talks on Thursday and Friday in Washington, they remain far apart on demands made by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration for structural changes to China's economy.\n\nBut the broad outline of what could make up a deal is beginning to emerge from the talks, the sources said, as the two sides push for an agreement by March 1. That marks the end of a 90-day truce that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to when they met in Argentina late last year.\n\nNegotiators are drawing up six memorandums of understanding on structural issues: forced technology transfer and cyber theft, intellectual property rights, services, currency, agriculture, and non-tariff barriers to trade, according to two sources familiar with the progress of the talks.\n\nAt meetings between U.S. and Chinese officials last week in Beijing the two sides traded texts and worked on outlining obligations on paper, according to one of the sources.\n\nThe process has become a real trade negotiation, the source said, so much so that at the end of the week the participants considered staying in Beijing to keep working. Instead they agreed to take a few days off and reconvene in Washington.\n\nThe sources requested anonymity to speak candidly about the talks.\n\nChinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng on Thursday declined to comment on the MOUs.\n\nU.S. equity index futures initially rallied on the news of progress in the talks, with the S&P 500\u2019s e-mini futures contract gaining about 0.4 percent over the following hour during Asian trading. The dollar strengthened and U.S. Treasury security yields rose.\n\nU.S. stocks later retreated in Thursday\u2019s Wall Street session following a batch of weaker-than-expected economic data, though the dollar and bond yields remained modestly higher.\n\nGETTING COMMITMENTS IN WRITING\n\nThe MOUs cover the most complex issues affecting the trading relationship between the two countries and are meant, from the U.S. perspective, to end the practices that led Trump to start levying duties on Chinese imports in the first place.\n\nOne source cautioned that the talks could still end in failure. But the work on the MOUs was a significant step in getting China to sign up both to broad principles and to specific commitments on key issues, he said.\n\nSeveral Chinese government sources told Reuters that the two countries have basically reached a consensus on alleviating the trade imbalances, but there were still some differences on each other's \"core demands\" that they were seeking to narrow.\n\n\"It can be said that we are now in the sprint phase, and both negotiating teams are working towards the goal of reaching an agreement within the deadline, but some problems are still quite complicated to resolve,\" said one Chinese official familiar with the situation.\n\nThe United States has accused Beijing of forcing U.S. companies doing business in China to share their technology with local partners and hand over intellectual property secrets. China denies it engages in such practices.\n\nTrump administration officials also object to non-tariff barriers in China, including industrial subsidies, regulations, business licensing procedures, product standards reviews and other practices that they say keep U.S. goods out of China or give an unfair advantage to domestic firms.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for China to open its financial services markets to more foreign firms, including major credit card companies Visa and MasterCard, which have waited years for China to make good on promises to allow them to operate there.\n\nOn currency, U.S. officials including Mnuchin have warned China against devaluing its yuan to gain a competitive advantage after the Chinese currency weakened significantly against the dollar last year, partly counteracting Trump's tariffs.\n\nStory continues"}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-hot-stocks-goldman-sachs-195900262.html", "text": "The tide is turning.

Delta\u2019s total revenue rose to $10.74 billion during Q4, up 5% year-over-year.\n\n\u201c2018 was a successful year for Delta with record operational reliability, increasing customer satisfaction, and solid financial results in the face of higher fuel costs\u201d said CEO Ed Bastian. \u201cAs we move into 2019, we expect to drive double-digit earnings growth through higher revenues, maintaining a cost trajectory below inflation, and the modest benefit from lower fuel costs.\u201d\n\nAs Tigress Financial\u2019s Ivan Feinseth (Track Record & Ratings) notes, a strong economy, low unemployment and increases in consumer spending are driving record levels of airline travel.\n\nThat\u2019s reflected in the company\u2019s strong buy consensus and 21% upside potential.Want to learn more about Delta?

In these trying times, you want to grab as many assurances as possible.\n\nNevertheless, within this context, high-growth stocks provide lucrative opportunities.\n\nFor one thing, growth stocks took a beating during the final quarter of 2018. Because they typically don\u2019t pay out dividends, panicked investors saw little reason to hold them. As well, the ferocious magnitude of losses made the selloff a self-fulfilling prophesy. This dynamic especially affected up-and-coming stocks which lacked longer-term credibility.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut the irony here is that the same volatility makes high-growth stocks attractive at these levels. Several top names, as well as the upstarts, now trade at steep discounts. That\u2019s bad for their management teams, but good for you. Now, those smoking-hot names you\u2019ve been eyeballing before can be acquired much more easily.\n\nHere are my top nine picks for \u201cmonster\u201d growth stocks that will kickstart strong gains in 2019:\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-Growth Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)\n\nHigh-Growth Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN) More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a monstrous final third in 2018, and I don\u2019t mean that in a good way. AMZN stock peaked on the first trading day of September. Since then, shares plummeted slightly over 34% before clawing back some of those losses.\n\nIn January of this year, AMZN got off to a brilliant start. Returning market sentiment towards high-growth stocks also boosted the tech firm\u2019s profile. But curiously, shares started to stagnate around mid-January. Amazon suffered some embarrassing PR, as well as the controversial cancellation of Amazon HQ2 in New York City.\n\nHowever, this is a great time to pounce on AMZN. The marriage between commerce and digitalization is only burning brighter. Naturally, this benefits Amazon and its dominant position in this sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook (FB)\n\nhigh-Growth Stocks: Facebook (FB) More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen you\u2019re talking about opportunities among the high-growth stocks of social media, most folks will likely point to Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Unsurprisingly, a positive earnings report finally lifted shares out of an ignominious pit.\n\nStill, I like sustainability in my growth stocks. Unfortunately, core indicators surrounding the social-media upstart suggest further pain down the road. However, I can\u2019t say the same thing about stalwart Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Sure, they\u2019ve suffered more controversies than the Donald Trump administration \u2014 okay, maybe not that many \u2014 hurting their credibility.\n\nBut despite all the negativities, we have facts.

The charges resulted in a net loss of $12.6 billion, or $10.34 a share.\n\nKraft Heinz shares fell as much as 28 percent to $34.90 in New York.\n\nFormed in a 2015 merger orchestrated by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the private equity firm 3G Capital, Kraft Heinz\u2019s portfolio plays mainly in the center of the grocery store, an area hit hard by shifts in eating and shopping habits, and the one at greatest risk of being disrupted by Amazon.com Inc.\n\nThe company, led by Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees, has tried to spruce up a tired suite of brands -- from organic Capri Sun to natural Oscar Mayer hot dogs. But the bigger question in the mind of investors has been management\u2019s ability to pull off the large, transformative deals that shareholders crave.\n\nKraft Heinz tried to purchase Unilever in 2017 in a move that would have allowed management to do what it does best: slash overhead costs. But Unilever rebuffed the $143 billion deal, and Kraft Heinz shares have since lost about half their value as investors wait for the next big move.\n\nOn Thursday, the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings missed even the lowest analyst estimate. It also flagged to investors in its quarterly results a subpoena it received last year from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to its procurement practices. Kraft Heinz said that as a result of an investigation with the help of an outside lawyer, it recorded a $25 million \u201cincrease to costs of products sold.\u201d\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment declined from a valuation of about $15.7 billion to $11.4 billion as the stock plunged to $35 at 10:04 a.m. in New York. Thursday\u2019s announcement marks the second time this year that a Berkshire holding has disclosed unfavorable news after the markets closed, hurting its stock. Apple Inc. trimmed its revenue outlook in January, which pummeled shareholders. That stock has since recovered.\n\nKraft Heinz will cut its quarterly dividend to 40 cents a share from 62.5 cents, helping it pay down debt more quickly and adjust to its smaller size after selling some businesses. The company had been paying out dividends at the highest ratio to earnings of its U.S. packaged-food peers.\n\nEurope-based food giants, including Nestle SA and Unilever, traded down in sympathy Friday, against modest gains in European stock indexes.\n\nKraft Heinz\u2019s bonds dropped the most relative to Treasuries in the company debt market on Friday morning. Risk premiums on the company\u2019s most actively traded debt, $1.1 billion of 4.625 percent notes due in 2029, increased 0.27 percent to 2.08 percent, weakening by the most since the debt was issued last year.\n\nThe cost to protect against a Kraft Heinz default for five years surged 27.7 basis points to 107.9 basis points, the most since 2013.\n\n(Updates Berkshire Hathaway stake value in eighth paragraph and bond trading in penultimate paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Katherine Chiglinsky, Cecile Daurat, Claire Boston and Jonathan Roeder.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Craig Giammona in New York at cgiammona@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Rob Golum, John J.

What's next for the stock? We take a look at earnings estimates for some clues.\n\nEnvestnet (ENV) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.59 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.40 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.39%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this financial services firm would post earnings of $0.50 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.53, delivering a surprise of 6%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nEnvestnet, which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, posted revenues of $210.08 million for the quarter ended December 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.21%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $182.86 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nEnvestnet shares have added about 14.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for Envestnet?\n\nWhile Envestnet has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Envestnet was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.38 on $206.66 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.01 on $886.32 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial Transaction Services is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AT&T stock has dug itself a hole in the debt garden and can\u2019t seem to dig itself out. No matter how many times management reiterates its cash flow outlook and plan to pay down debt, investors just aren\u2019t willing to gobble up AT&T stock.\n\nWith AT&T Stock's Now-Near 7% Yield, Can You Afford NOT To Buy It? More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a result, shares continue to stagnate in this $30 area, leaving it with an elevated dividend yield. That yield has been attractive to me over the past year, as I\u2019ve steadily collected and DRIP\u2019ed that quarterly payout as shares have essentially gone nowhere since last summer.\n\nIt also forced me to take a closer look at that dividend, wondering how characteristic it was of AT&T to yield 7% or more. Turns out, it\u2019s not very common.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAT&T\u2019s Dividend\n\nAfter its recent dividend bump of 4 cents per share in December, it marked another year with a dividend increase for AT&T stock. Not only has the company maintained its dividend payout for more than three decades, but it\u2019s actually raised its dividend for 35 consecutive years.\n\nWhile investors may dislike AT&T stock based on its debt load, valuation, growth profile or any number of other things, its dividend isn\u2019t one to hate on. Management has reaffirmed its cash flow outlook multiple times at this point, and most recently during the company\u2019s earnings report in January.\n\nThe dividend is safe and in this environment, it\u2019s hard to find a yield near 7% that an investor can actually count on. Not only is the dividend reliable, but it could actually suggest a good buying opportunity in AT&T stock. Over the last 30 years, AT&T has only yield more than 6.5% four times. Of those those few times, we rarely got a jump over 7% and when it did happen, it was relatively short-lived. Well, short-lived over the course of a three-decade chart, not necessarily in a few days or weeks.\n\nThat may give long-term investors some confidence on a name like AT&T, buying below $30 per share. The logic (and hope) being that the yield supports the stock price, so as to protect as much principal as possible.\n\nThe Bottom Line on AT&T\n\nchart of T stock dividend More\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\n\n\nThe biggest concern for AT&T stock at this point is the debt. Management has reiterated several times its plan to combat this issue and showed their intentions last quarter. In January, the company\u2019s balance sheet showed it cut long-term debt down to $166.25 billion from $170.21 billion in the prior quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly that\u2019s just a 2.3% reduction in overall debt and $166 billion is still quite the balance-sheet liability. But to reduce its debt by over 2% in one quarter should show investors that management is serious about cutting down its obligations. Further, the deal will improve AT&T\u2019s cash flow, which is imperative to both raising the dividend in the future and paying down its debt.\n\nThe company is expected to earn $3.64 per share this year, up just 1.7% year-over-year (YoY). On the revenue front, sales of almost $185 billion are expected to grow just 50 basis points YoY. Clearly, AT&T is starving for growth. But investors looking for growth would be better off in a growth-titan, balance-sheet stud like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nInstead, AT&T trades at just over 8 times earnings. Its yield of roughly 7% gives investors plenty of cushion and a play on potential upside. T stock is an income play with the potential for slight to moderate capital appreciation should management deliver on debt reduction and cash-flow initiatives. Investors should feel comfortable buying below $30 and preferably closer to $29 per share.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Help shape the future of investing tools and receive a $20 prize!\n\nIf you are an income investor, then Legal & General Group Plc (LON:LGEN) should be on your radar. Legal & General Group Plc provides various insurance products and services worldwide. Over the past 10 years, the UK\u00a316b market cap company has been growing its dividend payments, from \u00a30.060 to \u00a30.15. Currently yielding 5.7%, let\u2019s take a closer look at Legal & General Group\u2019s dividend profile.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Legal & General Group\n\nWhat Is A Dividend Rock Star?\n\nIt is a stock that pays a consistent, reliable and competitive dividend over a long period of time, and is expected to continue to pay in the same manner many years to come. More specifically:\n\nIts annual yield is among the top 25% of dividend payers\n\nIt has paid dividend every year without dramatically reducing payout in the past\n\nIts dividend per share amount has increased over the past\n\nIt can afford to pay the current rate of dividends from its earnings\n\nIt has the ability to keep paying its dividends going forward\n\nHigh Yield And Dependable\n\nLegal & General Group\u2019s dividend yield stands at 5.7%, which is high for Insurance stocks. But the real reason Legal & General Group stands out is because it has a proven track record of continuously paying out this level of dividends, from earnings, to shareholders and can be expected to continue paying in the future. This is a highly desirable trait for a stock holding if you\u2019re investor who wants a robust cash inflow from your portfolio over a long period of time.\n\nLSE:LGEN Historical Dividend Yield February 20th 19 More\n\nReliablity is an important factor for dividend stocks, particularly for income investors who want a strong track record of payment and a positive outlook for future payout. In the case of LGEN it has increased its DPS from \u00a30.060 to \u00a30.15 in the past 10 years. During this period it has not missed a payment, as one would expect for a company increasing its dividend. This is an impressive feat, which makes LGEN a true dividend rockstar.\n\nThe current trailing twelve-month payout ratio for the stock is 57%, meaning the dividend is sufficiently covered by earnings. Going forward, analysts expect LGEN\u2019s payout to increase to 69% of its earnings. Assuming a constant share price, this equates to a dividend yield of 6.8%. Moreover, EPS should increase to \u00a30.32. The higher payout forecasted, along with higher earnings, should lead to greater dividend income for investors moving forward.\n\nWhen thinking about whether a dividend is sustainable, another factor to consider is the cash flow. A company with strong cash flow, relative to earnings, can sometimes sustain a high pay out ratio.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nInvestors of Legal & General Group can continue to expect strong dividends from the stock. With its favorable dividend characteristics, if high income generation is still the goal for your portfolio, then Legal & General Group is one worth keeping around. However, given this is purely a dividend analysis, I recommend taking sufficient time to understand its core business and determine whether the company and its investment properties suit your overall goals.

But while many such stocks might seem attractive, it can be difficult to tell whether their high payouts, and the strength of their underlying businesses, are sustainable.\n\nTo that end, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to each identify a top dividend stock that yields at least 4%. Read on to learn why they like Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE: SKT), W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC), and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS).\n\nSuccessively taller stacks of coins with small plans growing on top More\n\nIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\n\nShopping for a juicy yield\n\nSteve Symington (Tanger Factory Outlet Centers): This isn't the first time I've touted Tanger Factory Outlet Centers as an attractive high-yield dividend stock. But with an annualized yield of 6.6% as of this writing, and as long as the outlet-center real estate investment trust (REIT) continues to prove that its model is an important part of today's retail industry for both its tenants and consumers, I'm more than happy to repeat my recommendation.\n\nThat said, Tanger's growth has suffered of late as it opts to make strategic rent adjustments to ensure it maintains a high portfolio occupancy rate, which stood at 96.8% last quarter. The company has also warned investors that it will probably need to deal with tenants pursuing bankruptcy, along with store closures and further lease adjustments, in the coming quarters.\n\nAt the same time, when Tanger most recently announced quarterly results last week, it revealed improved sequential performance that helped the company exceed expectations in 2018 and raise its dividend -- this time by 1.4% to $1.42 per share -- for the 26th consecutive year. Tanger also announced that it's in the early stages of future development for a new 280,000-square-foot outlet center in Tennessee.\n\nOf course, you might worry that Tanger's high yield is too good to be true. But as CEO Steven Tanger noted in last quarter's earnings release, it will be no problem to maintain, as it's \"supported by one of the lowest payout ratios in the sector, along with a fortress low-levered balance sheet.\"\n\nFor investors willing to buy Tanger and collect that big dividend, I think the stock should handily beat the market as it solidifies its supporting position in our changing retail landscape.\n\nThese knocks are really benefits\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer (W.P. Carey): W.P. Carey is a REIT that owns what are known as net lease properties. More on that in a second. For right now, focus on the fact that it offers a robust 5.5% yield, well above peers Realty Income (NYSE: O) and National Retail Properties (NYSE: NNN), which yield 3.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Carey's dividend, meanwhile, has increased every year for more than two decades, roughly equivalent to these industry bellwethers.\n\nSome investors don't like that Carey is super diversified, but it's really a net positive. For example, the REIT's portfolio is spread across the industrial (27% of rents), office (23%), retail (17%), warehouse (16%), education (4%), and \"other\" sectors. It also generates around 35% of its rents from foreign markets. Far from a negative, this diversification gives Carey a host of ways to grow its business that its peers, which are largely focused on the domestic retail sector, lack."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-vanguard-index-funds-complete-160537933.html", "text": "[Editor\u2019s note: This story was previously published in October 2018. It has since been updated and republished. Symbols of most of the Vanguard mutual funds were updated from the original column to reflect Vanguard\u2019s change to the Admiral series of mutual funds which have lower fees. ]\n\nVanguard index funds have long been at the forefront of passive investing and are favorites among the buy-and-hold community for building long-term portfolios.\n\nIn terms of assets, two of Vanguard\u2019s funds, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (MUTF:VTSMX) and Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (MUTF:VBTLX), are respectively among the largest stock funds and bond funds in the investment universe.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhen investors say they want to build a \u201cset-it-and-forget-it\u201d portfolio or a \u201clazy\u201d portfolio, they look to Vanguard\u2019s broad selection of dirt-cheap mutual funds to do the building.\n\nThere are many ways to construct a portfolio, but a timeless approach is to use a core and satellite structure, which consists of one or two core holdings that receive the highest allocations and usually three to five satellite holdings that receive smaller allocations.\n\nWith that backdrop in mind, here are seven Vanguard index funds to build a complete portfolio:\n\nVanguard 500 Index (VFIAX)\n\nExpenses: 0.04%\n\nMinimum Investment: $3,000\n\n\n\nTo get your portfolio started with Vanguard index funds, there\u2019s arguably no better choice than Vanguard\u2019s flagship index fund, Vanguard 500 Index (MUTF:VFIAX).\n\nAlthough many investors and advisors might argue that the Total Stock Market fund is a better choice for a core holding because of its broader diversity, VFIAX is a smart choice for investors building a portfolio to include several funds.\n\nSince VFIAX only includes roughly the top U.S. stocks by market cap, such as top holdings Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), investors can build around this fund with another fund that holds small- and mid-cap stocks.\n\nVanguard Extended Market Index (VEXAX)\n\nExpenses: 0.08%\n\nMinimum Investment: $3,000\n\n\n\nA perfect compliment to VFIAX is Vanguard Extended Market Index (MUTF:VEXAX), which will complete your exposure to the U.S. stock market.\n\nVEXAX tracks the S&P Completion Index, which includes small- and mid-cap U.S. stocks. Together with Vanguard\u2019s S&P 500 Index fund, an investor will capture the entire U.S. stock market. Since VEXAX provides more exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks than a total stock fund would provide, it introduces a combination of higher potential long-term returns and greater diversity to a portfolio.\n\nTop holdings for VEXAX include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and Worldpay (NYSE:WP).\n\nVanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBTLX)\n\nExpenses: 0.05%\n\nMinimum Investment: $3,000\n\n\n\nArguably the best mutual fund to buy for a fixed-income core holding, Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (MUTF:VBTLX) is an outstanding way to get cheap exposure to the entire U.S. bond market.\n\nVBTLX tracks the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index, which includes over 8,500 U.S. bonds across the spectrum of short-, intermediate-, and long-term in duration, and multiple categories of bonds, including corporate, municipal and U.S. Treasury issues.\n\nWith such broad exposure to the bond market, combined with the low expenses of just 0.05%, it\u2019s no wonder that VBTLX is the largest bond fund in the world, as measured by assets under management.\n\n\n\nVanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX)\n\nExpenses: 0.11%\n\nMinimum Investment: $3,000\n\n\n\nTo cover the stock market outside of the U.S., you can get the job done with just one Vanguard index fund \u2014 Vanguard Total International Stock Index (MUTF:VTIAX).\n\nThis international stock index fund does cover the full range of market capitalization; however, it is cap-weighted, which means the top holdings are large-cap stocks, such as Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) and Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY).\n\nVanguard FTSE Social Index (VFTSX)\n\nExpenses: 0.18%\n\nMinimum Investment: $3,000\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for alternative equity core holding or a compliment to your existing stock funds, Vanguard FTSE Social Index (MUTF:VFTSX) is a good choice, especially for the socially conscious investor."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-gold-stocks-percolating-now-193104245.html", "text": "The yellow metal has been on fire, with gold hitting multi-month highs and threatening to run to new 52-week highs should its recent momentum continue. As such, gold stocks have been on the move as well, pushing higher as its underlying product gains in value.\n\nTo no surprise then, the SPDR Gold ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD) continues to climb as well, a trade we outlined the other day as part of our daily Top Stock Trades note. Should it hold up over support, the GLD can certainly press higher and threaten to make a much larger breakout. Let\u2019s look at three of the best gold stocks that could climb as a result.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGold Mining ETFs\n\ntop stock trades for GLD More\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nThe most direct way to play gold is through physical bullion. Meaning that investors can head to their local coin and metals dealer or an online site that sells gold coins, bars and bullion. That\u2019s the most obvious and direct way of investing in the metal, but there are added costs to account for. Storing the metal, shipping it and paying a premium are all considerations before making a decision.\n\nThen there\u2019s the futures market, which is a direct way to purchase the metal. However, short of playing these contracts as a trade, they will eventually expire. It will force the investor to continually \u201croll\u201d their investment into another futures contract or exercise the contract and take delivery of physical gold.\n\nSo that leaves gold stocks ETFs as one alternative. Investors can consider the GLD ETF, which we highlighted above as one option. Of the gold ETFs, it\u2019s certainly the most popular. While there are drawbacks to owning gold ETFs vs. physical bullion (just as there are drawbacks to owning the latter instead of the former), gold ETFs are certainly the easiest to buy and sell. It\u2019s just like buying and selling a stock and it makes for a simple way to diversify.\n\nAnother option? Owning gold miner ETFs. The largest and most well-known are the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDXJ). Gold miners perform much like gold, but generally have larger moves in the both directions. So if you believe gold is set to rally, it\u2019s quite likely that the GDX and GDXJ will outperform. If you believe gold is set to fall, these two will likely like underperform the underlying metal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD)\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nGetting into company-specific gold stocks, one consideration is certainly Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). The miner commands a market cap of $24.1 billion after it merged with Randgold at the beginning of the year. Aside from the synergies created by the deal and the benefits of larger scale, GOLD has one big benefit investors miss when investing directly in gold or the GLD: yield.\n\nOne big complaint about investing in gold is that it\u2019s a hard asset. It does not generate income, report profits or have a business that becomes more valuable over time. Instead, it simply relies on investor demand and inflation to boost its value. With Barrick though, investors can collect a 2% dividend yield from their investment. That\u2019s no 7% like you get from AT&T (NYSE:T), but it is a nice chunk of income.\n\nAnalysts predict that revenue will rise 16% this year, fueling a 29% increase in earnings to 45 cents per share. I don\u2019t like to put much (if any) credence into outlooks two years out because commodity prices can fluctuate so much in that span, but analysts are calling for a further 9% bump in earnings despite relatively flat revenue growth in fiscal 2020."}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/erie-indemnity-4q-earnings-snapshot-232816520.html", "text": "ERIE, Pa.

After three years at the company, Abbi realized she needed to take time for her mental health. To top it all off, her father, who lived across the world in Australia, was battling pancreatic cancer; she desperately wanted to be there for her him.\n\n\u201cI initially went [to my boss] thinking I\u2019d only be allowed to take an extended break without pay,\u201d she says. But after explaining her situation \u2014 and presenting a list of possible solutions \u2014 Abbi was granted a leave. \u201cThey were extremely supportive and sympathetic to my situation, and offered me short-term disability so I'd be somewhat financially covered.\u201d\n\nThough Abbi\u2019s case is unique, the circumstances leading to her leave are not. Today, millennials are grappling with some serious challenges at work. According to recent statistics, three in ten millennials say they are \u201cvery often or always burned out,\u201d and also experience \u201cwork-disrupting anxiety \u201d twice as much as the national average. And it doesn\u2019t stop there: Millennial depression is also on the rise.\n\nFor those facing climbing levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental-health issues, the ability to take time away from work to recover \u2014 even while forgoing pay \u2014 can seem appealing. But what exactly does such leave entail? And is it a good idea?\n\nToday, there are a few options for workers feeling the weight of a stressful job. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows eligible employees who work for eligible employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specific medical or family reasons, such as pregnancy, adoption, or personal or family illness. But these options are not available to everyone, and those who wish to take time away from work for mental-health reasons may need to consult with their employer to design an appropriate plan of action.\n\nIn Abbi\u2019s case, she was granted a leave of four months and ended up spending five with her mother and ailing father in Australia. After her father passed away, Abbi returned to her life and job in New York, though she regrets jumping back in so soon. \u201cComing back to reality was very tough,\u201d she explains. \u201cI went back to work straight away, thinking I owed my boss and should bury myself in work, which I now know was a mistake.\u201d\n\nStill, Abbi\u2019s leave of absence proved to be a worthwhile decision. She says the experience changed her perceptions of work in a positive way. \u201cI was so thankful I didn\u2019t assume the worst of my employer and just quit my job before checking if they'd support me through a tough time,\u201d she says. \"After going through this, I have reprioritized my life, putting self care, personal happiness and not sweating the small stuff so much.\" However, not every leave of absence turns out this way.\n\nWhen Salma*, 29, graduated from college, she found a job as a medical assistant at a large healthcare corporation in Chicago. She soon realized the culture wasn't exactly healthy. \u201cOur boss wanted us to always come in early and leave late; it felt like we were constantly under watch,\u201d Salma explains, adding the company had a severe turnover problem. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be there.\u201d\n\nSalma realized she was experiencing burnout and approached her manager about it. \u201cShe was kind of supportive, but also asked who was going to do my work, since I was one of the main people running the show,\u201d says Salma. Her boss reluctantly agreed to give her time off, but since the company was not eligible for FMLA, Salma ended up putting her vacation time toward her leave. \u201c[The rest] was unpaid, but I thought my sanity was more important.\u201d\n\nSalma took three weeks away, traveling to her native Bangladesh, where she began building a healthcare nonprofit for women and children. After she returned, however, things felt \"really tense.\" Back in the office, Salma's manager brought up the discussion they\u2019d initially had when Salma first asked to go on leave, in which she shared with her boss that she might need to give notice if her experiences at work didn\u2019t improve.\n\n\"She told me that she would gladly accept my resignation, [even though] I hadn\u2019t brought up [the topic] since before I went on my leave,\u201d Salma says, adding that the manager then asked her to write a statement of resignation. \u201cI said okay, and that was that. That was my last day.\u201d Still, though Salma\u2019s leave ultimately resulted in the end of her job, she doesn\u2019t regret taking time to re-center. \u201cI am grateful for this experience,\" she says. \"It made me realize what I don\u2019t want in a boss and helped me to identify red flags.\"\n\nStory continues"}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/solar-capital-4q-earnings-snapshot-003224458.html", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) _ Solar Capital Ltd.

There is no timetable on his return.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn strictly business terms, this might actually be a boon for Williamson. All you need to know is that soon after the incident, Puma\u2019s Twitter account offered up this take:\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t have happened in the Pumas.\u201d\n\nPuma later deleted the tweet out of sensitivity but it did crystalize the stakes involved here and the increased influence over the shoe industry that this unlikely event now provides Williamson.\n\n\u201cZion was sitting in the catbird\u2019s seat to begin with and assuming he is fine and healthy, all he got was even more leverage,\u201d said Peter Miller of the Massachusetts-based Jabez Marketing Group, which specializes in the marketing of professional athletes.\n\nDuke Blue Devils forward Zion Williamson (1) reacts after falling during the first half against the North Carolina Tar Heels at Cameron Indoor Stadium. (Reuters/USA Today)\n\nWilliamson was already the No. 1 target coming out of college athletics this year for shoe and apparel companies. His combination of size, speed and highlight-reel dunks have made him arguably the biggest potential sneaker endorser since LeBron James joined the NBA in 2003.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s game is ideal for modern social media \u2013 he produces viral moments nearly every game and already has 2.4 million Instagram followers. He is the likely national player of the year with brand-name Duke and could still be a national champion. He\u2019ll be the No. 1 pick in June\u2019s NBA draft and could even wind up with the New York Knicks.\n\nHe\u2019s already a star. He was always going to command a massive amount of endorsement money.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll set the record for a shoe deal of any NBA rookie,\u201d said Sonny Vaccaro, the retired shoe executive who signed Michael Jordan to Nike, Kobe Bryant to Adidas and was heavily involved in LeBron\u2019s pre-NBA career. \u201cHe\u2019ll be one of the biggest guys in the league, right away.\u201d\n\nThat could mean up to $10 million per year, before he is even drafted.\n\nNow it could be even more, likely millions more. While Nike, Adidas, Puma and Under Armour were all expected to bid for Williamson, the stakes are considerably higher now for all of them, especially Nike, the wealthiest of those suitors.\n\n\u201cYou would think Nike has to sign him,\u201d said Miller, who previously worked as an executive with Reebok. \u201cAt the same time, Adidas also has no choice. For Adidas, you can have this storyline without even playing the clip.\u201d\n\nFor Nike, losing out on Zion is not just to risk missing out on the next LeBron who could conceivably shift the paradigm of the shoe industry since the swoosh rode Jordan to dominance in the mid-1980s. That would be a bad day for Nike.\n\nThis would be worse though because if Williamson were to sign with anyone other Nike, the story, at least partially, would not be that the company was simply outbid for his services, but rather that he chose a competitor because Nike made faulty and unsafe shoes. It\u2019s a double hit.\n\nIt could be seen, and likely marketed, as a rejection of Nike due to substandard design and construction by a player who came up in the Nike grassroots system and chose to play for one of Nike\u2019s flagship college programs only to be put in a risky position by Nike. In other words, Nikes aren\u2019t safe.\n\nWouldn\u2019t have happened in the Pumas \u2026 or Adidas \u2026 or whatever\n\n\u201cThis was a malfunction of their product,\u201d Vaccaro said. \u201cThey said it was a Paul George shoe. Well, are all the shoes made under the Paul George line like that? This is what they are out there selling, what they put on the most popular kid in the biggest game of the year.\u201d\n\nNike certainly isn\u2019t happy with what happened.\n\n\u201cWe are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery,\u201d Nike said in a statement. \u201cThe quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance. While this is an isolated occurrence, we are working to identify the issue.\u201d\n\nWilliamson is expected to turn pro at the end of Duke\u2019s season, which will be either next month or in early April. He will then be free to sign endorsement deals.\n\nThe best way for Nike to put this behind it is to sign Zion Williamson. Get him and all is well. Make him a signature shoe, put it on the market and watch sales soar. That was already going to be costly.\n\nAfter Wednesday night, however, Zion\u2019s value is not just as an endorser who can prop up say Adidas or Puma, but at the same time drag down Nike.\n\nThat motivates Adidas, Puma and anyone else. And, in turn, further motivates Nike.\n\nAnd motivation, in this case, means money.\n\n\u201cI just hope he\u2019s OK,\u201d Vaccaro said. \u201cBut look, as long as he is healthy, Zion is now in an even better position in dealing with Nike than he was before. And he was already in great position. Zion is about to maximize his position.\u201d\n\nThat blown Nike has the potential to be one valuable, if unlikely, shoe.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\u2022 Jim Boeheim unlikely to face charges after fatal accident\n\n\u2022 How Zion\u2019s shoe mishap hurts Nike\n\n\u2022 MLB video game makes girl \u2018mad and upset\u2019\n\n\u2022 College coach accused of stealing underwear\n\n"}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/district-attorney-syracuse-coach-jim-boeheim-not-expected-face-legal-ramifications-fatal-accident-164844373.html", "text": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. \u2013 The Onondaga County (New York) district attorney told Yahoo Sports on Thursday morning that there will not be any immediate legal ramifications after Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim\u2019s role in a tragic and fatal car accident on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cNot from law enforcement, unless something extraordinary or bizarre comes to our attention that we\u2019re not aware of,\u201d said district attorney William J.

Boeheim attempted to avoid the car, which was stretched across parts of two highway lanes. The four people in the car, including Jimenez, were attempting to cross the highway to seek safety on the median. Along with Jimenez\u2019s death, one other person in the car was injured.\n\nPolice complimented Boeheim\u2019s actions after the accident, including calling 911 and using his cell phone flashlight to flag down cars while Jimenez was being attended to. \u201cMr. Boeheim did exactly what he was supposed to do,\u201d Buckner said.\n\nFitzpatrick outlined the next steps expected to take place, including determining the cause of the original accident, status of the driver and an autopsy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take final statements and do an accident reconstruction and find out where as best we can the deceased was standing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether or not there are any skid marks.

One assistant, according to a recording of a conversation Alexiou provided to the Chronicle, tried to justify Brown\u2019s comments by saying the coach was trying to \u201cencourage\u201d the player. In the aftermath, Alexiou filed a report of discrimination. From the Montgomery County Chronicle:\n\nStory continues\n\nAsked by the Montgomery County Chronicle on Tuesday how he felt during the events of the past week, Alexiou said he never felt that anyone within the ICC administration or athletic department was sticking up for him, especially as it applies to discrimination based on nationality. That\u2019s why he chose to post a screenshot of the text messages from Feb. 12 on social media.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I did some stupid things to get a suspension, but there are a lot of other incidents on the team that do not get reported.\u201d\n\nBoard of Trustees calls for meeting to discuss Brown\n\nDan Barwick, the president of Independence Community College, told the Chronicle in a statement that he has spoken to Brown about the exchange and that the school \u201cdoes not condone the language\u201d used by Brown.\n\n\u201cI have spoken with Coach Brown about his message to the student, and he fully understands that his language was not appropriate. The college is investigating the matter and will have no further statement at this time,\u201d Barwick told the paper on Tuesday.\n\nIn the text message exchange, Brown threatened to take away Alexiou\u2019s scholarship. Alexiou told the Chronicle earlier this week that he did not lose his scholarship but he was unsure of his status on the football team.\n\nAccording to KGGF NewsRadio, the ICC Board of Trustees called for a special executive session to discuss a \u201cpersonnel issue.\u201d The meeting took place Thursday evening at 6 p.m. and no action was taken.\n\nBrown\u2019s brash personality was a focus of \u2018Last Chance U\u2019\n\nBrown was named ICC\u2019s head coach in 2016, tasked with turning around a program that consistently finished near the bottom of its conference.\n\nBrown, a brash, outspoken native of Compton, California, quickly shook things up. The Pirates went 5-4 in his first season and 9-2 in his second season. His third season became the focus of the third season of \u201cLast Chance U\u201d, a Netflix series that documents junior college football programs that become landing spots for high-level prospects who fizzle out at FBS schools.\n\nOn the show, Brown routinely had conflicts \u2014 filled with plenty of colorful language \u2014 with many of his players, including former Florida State quarterback Malik Henry.\n\n\u201cLast Chance U\u201d\u2018s fourth season was also shot at ICC and is scheduled to be released in the summer.

But for us, we\u2019re definitely disappointed, it\u2019s not something we wanted to happen. I know that everybody\u2019s doing their job and John feels like that was a chance for him to help the Broncos out.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nKeenum understands how the business of the NFL can go. He was undrafted despite a record-setting college career at Houston. He has bounced around; the Broncos are his fourth team. He finally got a great shot in a good situation in Minnesota two years ago and played very well, helping the Vikings make the NFC championship game.\n\nAnd now, he\u2019s basically back at Square One.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s another chapter in our lives and we\u2019re going to roll with it,\u201d Keenum said on the Sports Spectrum Podcast. \u201cWe\u2019re going to approach this like I do everything in my entire life, and that it\u2019s not by accident this has happened. It\u2019s just another chapter and another opportunity to overcome some adversity in my life.\u201d\n\nKeenum\u2019s future up in the air\n\nIf Keenum is not traded and then gets released, he\u2019ll be an interesting name on the market. His strong 2017 season wasn\u2019t that long ago, and while he wasn\u2019t good enough for the Broncos, he also wasn\u2019t absolutely incompetent with a bad roster around him.\n\nYet, most teams aren\u2019t dying for a starting quarterback. There should be as many as four more quarterbacks drafted in the first round, Nick Foles will be on the move and Teddy Bridgewater will be a free agent, too.

In fact were it up to her, Osaka would probably eschew her media commitments and luxuriate in playing her favourite video games instead.\n\nYet over the last year, Osaka, the No. 1 ranked tennis player who in press conferences can make a rabbit looking at headlights appear positively self-assured, has become a beacon for emotional literacy and mental health awareness.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJudged by the numbers alone, the last 12 months has been a halcyon period for the Japanese Osaka, who grew up in America and has a Haitian father. Flying up the rankings from No. 72 to the top spot and picking up two grand slams along the way, Osaka, still only 21, is ostensibly living the dream.\n\nOsaka has found the journey difficult, however, and has been startlingly open in describing her struggles - especially over the last week in the wake of her shock split from coach Sascha Bajin. Having first of all explained that she ended the hugely successful partnership with Bajin because \u201cI wouldn't put success over my happiness\u201d, Osaka expanded on the theme after losing to Kristina Mladenovic in Dubai on Tuesday. Asked if she could block out the noise around her coaching split, Osaka responded. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s the result. This match is the result of that.\n\n\u201cSee, it\u2019s a little bit hard because I feel like people are staring at me, and not like in a good way.\u201d As she began to cry, Osaka added: \u201cI don\u2019t think I necessarily understand what position I\u2019m in, in a way, because last year I wasn\u2019t even anywhere close to this ranking. People didn\u2019t pay attention to me. That\u2019s something that I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch candidness tends to be the rule rather than exception for Osaka. Just a couple of days after defeating Serena Williams in that frazzling US Open final in September, Osaka said of the mental health challenges facing elite athletes: \u201cYou can easily get depressed. You think your whole world is over.\u201d Last April, having recently won her biggest title to date at Indian Wells, Osaka revealed: \u201cYesterday I woke up and I was really depressed, but I don\u2019t know why. Like, I\u2019m so sad right now.\u201d\n\nAdmissions like these are uncomfortable but potentially game-changing. Tennis has always had an awkward relationship with mental health, with players typically suppressing their concerns until it is too late. Andre Agassi is a salient example of this trend, opting to stay quiet until revealing all in his explosive autobiography Open where he compared the life of a tennis player to \u201csolitary confinement\u201d.

Their most promising drive late in the fourth quarter ended when quarterback Jared Goff threw a pass that was intercepted by Patriots cornerback Stephon Gilmore.\n\nSo, what did the Patriots do to slow down the Rams' offense?\n\n\"Bill (Belichick) does a great job of putting his team in the right position,\" Rams running back C.J.

If anybody wants to go back and watch the Super Bowl - if you watch their season, 90 percent they've been in (man-to-man defense). They play a little zone (here and there) but they probably played 80 percent zone against us, because they probably didn't think they had the best matchups.\"\n\nWhy the change in defensive strategy for the Patriots?\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think it was to help stop our big plays,\" Anderson said. \"Just from the outside when I was watching the Rams when they came on primetime, big plays got the offense going. The run game got the offense going. So if you slow down the run game and then you limited the big plays. Obviously, we had plenty against Dallas and then our big plays against New Orleans were just enough to find a way to win. I think (the Patriots) slowed down all our big plays, and it was kind of frustrating, and that's kind of how the game went. It sucks.\"\n\nThe Patriots did limit the Rams on the ground, holding L.A. to just 62 rushing yards on 18 carries (3.4 yards per attempts). New England's defense gave its best performance of the season when it mattered most, and that's one of the main reasons why the team won its sixth Lombardi Trophy.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

The evidence cited: \u201cBryce Harper turned down a $300 million offer from the Nationals!\u201d If I\u2019ve heard that once I\u2019ve heard it six hundred times.\n\nWell, turns out that there was a catch: a full one-third of that was deferred money, reducing the deal considerably in terms of present value. From MLB.com:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSources told MLB.com on Wednesday that the Nationals have no plans to give Harper a mega-deal comparable to Machado\u2019s 10-year, $300 million contract with the Padres, likely ending any chance for Washington\u2019s longtime face of the franchise to remain with the club. The Nationals offered Harper a contract worth $300 million over 10 years before the end of the 2018 regular season. Harper and his agent Scott Boras rejected the deal. Two sources said that roughly $100 million of that offer would have been deferred money, lowering the present-day value of the contract.\n\nAs Craig Edwards of Fangraphs tweeted a bit ago, a ten year, $300 million deal that pays $20 million a year for ten years then $10 million a year, deferred, after that has the same present value as a straight 10-year deal for $244 million. There are other ways to structure that \u2014 shorter deferral periods or longer, Bobby Bonilla-style periods \u2014 but no matter how you slice it, deferring one-third of a $300 million deal is a big financial hit for the player compared to the stated and widely-reported \u201c$300 million offer.\u201d\n\nTo be petty: when that \u201c$300 million offer\u201d was reported last November, I said this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe offer was reportedly for roughly $300 million over a ten-year span. How much of that was deferred, backloaded or what have you is unknown . . . As with all reports like these, it\u2019s worth appreciating that someone may have an incentive to put this out there. In this case, I suspect, the Nationals, to signal to fans that they made an effort to lock Harper up before he was able to negotiate with teams other than Washington. Doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen, but just how specifically good or bad the deal was is not something we can know.\n\nWell, now we know.\n\nAnyway, as the MLB.com story notes, Harper was not taking that kind of deal from the Nationals and the Nats aren\u2019t sweetening it, so the chances of him going back to Washington are, apparently, nil.\n\nThe takeaway: be wary of reported offers. Both when they favor the team\u2019s interest and when they favor the player\u2019s interest.

Something was clearly wrong.\n\nRams said Todd Gurley was healthy\n\nBut the Rams insisted all was well. Gurley wasn\u2019t listed on injury reports ahead of games, and the team reported that the knee injury that sidelined Gurley for the last two weeks of the regular season was no longer a factor.\n\nThe Rams maintained the line even after the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cHe is [healthy],\u201d McVay said. \u201cI never enabled him to get into a rhythm offensively. \u2026 I think a lot of it was a result of some of the things they did, but a lot of it was play selection.

Anderson says Todd Gurley was hurt\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the first time since the Super Bowl, we\u2019re hearing contradictory information from inside the team indicating that Gurley was still dealing with knee issues.\n\nIt came Wednesday from Anderson, who opened up about Gurley\u2019s struggles with Skip Bayless on \u201cUndisputed.\u201d\n\n\"[New England] slowed down a lot of our big plays and it was frustrating.\"@cjandersonb22 on Super Bowl LIII pic.twitter.com/iGoe1GWe3D \u2014 UNDISPUTED (@undisputed) February 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was more hurt than what we thought,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe injury was a little bit more than what everybody in the building thought, including himself.\u201d\n\nSprained knee?\n\nSo Gurley wasn\u2019t right, according to his backfield mate.

I would say sprained knee. Obviously, it\u2019s the same knee injury he\u2019s had before in his career. Obviously I had surgery on my meniscus, and once you have a knee, you always have a knee. So it aggravates, and if he was getting a lot of touches earlier in the year \u2014 obviously him being one of the best running backs, that probably was the case.\u201d\n\nWhat Anderson told Bayless confirms what appeared obvious to everyone watching the Rams through the playoffs. There was no rational explanation for the team not using one of the game\u2019s greatest weapons when the stakes were the highest other than injury.\n\nBeyond injury, there was no rational reason for C.J. Anderson to see the field more than Todd Gurley in the playoffs. (Getty)\n\nWhy would Rams hide a Gurley injury?\n\nIt all begs the question, why? Why wouldn\u2019t the Rams open up about Gurley\u2019s status? Why would they take the risk of significant penalty for inaccurate information on an injury report instead of simply listing Gurley as questionable or probable?\n\nWas McVay so wary of giving Bill Belichick a competitive advantage that he would rather hide Gurley\u2019s injury?\n\nIt seems unlikely barring something more significant than lingering struggles from a knee sprain surfacing that we\u2019ll ever get a straight answer from the Rams about Gurley\u2019s health.\n\nAnd the Rams may rue Anderson\u2019s candidness that contradicts the company line.\n\nBut between watching the Rams and hearing Anderson\u2019s comments Wednesday, it\u2019s not hard to do the math.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports\n\n\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\u2022 Former NFL player fatally shot in parking dispute\n\n\u2022 QB Cousins angers Minnesota with a tweet\n\n\u2022 Just weeks after startup, AAF faced big money woes\n\n\u2022 LaMelo Ball still plans to go to college\n\n"}, {"source": "yahoo", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/report-interim-pelicans-gm-danny-ferry-wants-nba-back-off-demand-anthony-davis-plays-055319804.html", "text": "One of the biggest questions of the NBA season post-All-Star break is how much \u2014 if at all \u2014 Anthony Davis will play for the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nAfter failing to consummate a trade before the deadline, the Pelicans announced that they would play Davis for the rest of the season.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt is largely believed that the announcement came under pressure from the league that it has the right to impose a $100,000 fine every time a team rests a healthy player.\n\nA lot has changed since that announcement\n\nSince that announcement, Anthony Davis has put up sporadic performances and injured his shoulder in a game.\n\n[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]\n\nThe shoulder injury wasn\u2019t serious.

Harper's former team, the Washington Nationals, could still be in the picture, according to reports.\n\n--Free agent infielder Josh Harrison has reached an agreement on a one-year contract with the Detroit Tigers, according to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.\n\nThe deal reportedly is pending a physical. Harrison is expected to be the Tigers' everyday second baseman.\n\nHarrison, 31, has spent his eight-year career with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a utility player, starting 352 games at second base, 207 at third base, 80 in the outfield and 22 at shortstop. He was selected to the All-Star Game in 2014 and '17.\n\n--Jed Lowrie's preparation for his first season with the New York Mets will slow down considerably after an issue with his left knee was deemed serious enough for an MRI.\n\nLowrie, who turns 35 in April, said at spring training in Port St. Lucie, Fla., that the back of his left knee has been giving him discomfort.

He has clubbed at least 20 home runs in each of the past three seasons, and he has eclipsed .300 in back-to-back seasons.\n\n\"We talked about (an extension) over the last year or so, and if both parties can be happy, then we'll see,\" Rendon said in comments published by MASNSports.com. \"If not, then we'll see what happens.

That's something they've freely admitted: Kyrie Irving said this team lacked experience after a tough loss to the Orlando Magic in January, while Marcus Morris said earlier this month it \"hasn't been fun for a long time\" in the C's locker room.\n\nIrving was asked about the Celtics' turbulent season to date in a sit-down interview with Rachel Nichols that aired Wednesday morning on ESPN. His comments were candid and eye-opening.\n\n\"It's a lot to figure out all in one year,\" Irving said. \"It's been a trying year for us. Because we basically have a bunch of young men in our locker room that feel like they're capable of doing a lot more of what they're doing.\n\n\"And that's OK. But there's a maturity that you have to have. There's a professionalism that you have to really showcase every single day. And that's what the great ones do.\"\n\nMORE CELTICS COVERAGE\n\nIrving delivered a similar message back in January. But this time, he named names, referencing backup guard Terry Rozier while explaining the effects of Boston's minutes crunch.\n\n\"I initially didn't play the minutes I wanted to play. I'm 26 years old heading into my prime. Like why do I have to wait for anybody?\" Irving said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Terry Rozier -- he played in the playoffs (last season), he did extremely well. Coming back, that's a natural competition that me and him have. Like, it is what it is. No one wants to say it, but I will.\n\n\"It's part of their growth. When you have winning in mind, then you've got to do what it takes, but you've got to understand your teammates.\"\n\nThe Celtics' lone All-Star (and pending free agent) insisted his primary focus is on winning, and that any comments he makes are meant to push his teammates to be better.\n\nBut Irving apparently also is aware of how players speaking out to the media instead of addressing issues directly can lead to problems.\n\n\"A lot of things that are said get into locker rooms,\" he added. \"Media has broken up locker rooms. It's been done before. Where you say something and it's misinterpreted, and instead of addressing it with the person or individual, like human interaction, you read it on your phone.\n\n\"You read it on a text, like somebody says, 'Hey, did you see what this person said about you?' and it's your teammate, and you're like, 'Wait, I didn't hear that.'\n\n\"And then you hold back, don't say anything to him and then throughout the season, it ends up coming out again. That's not the way life is supposed to go, and it's not the way basketball is supposed to go.\"\n\nWhether Irving's comments push any buttons in the C's locker room remains to be seen. But Boston faces a tough challenge immediately after the All-Star break, visiting Milwaukee on Thursday night to battle the Eastern Conference-leading Bucks.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
