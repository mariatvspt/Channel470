Fry, who works in the IRS\u2019 San Francisco office, downloaded multiple sensitive documents with Cohen\u2019s private banking information on May 4, 2018, and quickly placed a call to a cellphone number associated with Avenatti. Fry was able to access those files, and additional ones he made after the call because he assists IRS agents who review suspicious-activity reports \u2014 documents that banks and others are required by law to file when they are aware of a potentially suspicious financial transition. Cohen\u2019s accounts had generated multiple such reports.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCohen was Trump\u2019s personal attorney in 2016 during the presidential campaign when he paid the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to stay quiet about an affair she said she had with Trump. It was later discovered that the payment potentially violated campaign-finance law. Avenatti last year filed a lawsuit on behalf of Daniels in her attempt to void a nondisclosure agreement about the alleged affair.\n\nLate last year, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to tax fraud and lying to Congress about work he did on a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow. Multiple investigators, including special counsel Robert Mueller and his team, are looking into whether Trump campaign officials helped Russia interfere in the 2016 election. Cohen is set to begin serving his sentence in May.\n\nThe federal complaint that was unsealed on Thursday says Fry verbally admitted to federal investigators that he leaked the documents to Avenatti, and also made a written statement to the same effect. He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 if convicted of the unlawful disclosure of suspicious-activity reports.\n\nKeep up with POLITICO Playbook The 2020 Election.

The Russian-linked payment was routed through Essential Consultants, an LLC that Cohen also used to accept payments from companies like AT&T and Novartis in a bid to turn his status as Trump\u2019s longtime fixer into cash as companies scrambled to understand the then-nascent administration. In a document posted on Twitter, Avenatti further outlined his claims, according to prosecutors.\n\nAvenatti, according to the complaint, also gave information about the reports to The Washington Post for an article it published on May 8.\n\nThe information sparked a flurry of news reports, and AT&T, Novartis and other companies quickly confirmed their relationships with Cohen and issued conciliatory statements. But the source of the documents remained a mystery, a subject that received renewed interest after the New Yorker published a report by Ronan Farrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, that featured a \u201claw enforcement official\u201d who was going public with his motivation to leak the information.\n\nThe complaint, following traditional protocol, does not name Farrow, but describes a \u201cReporter-1\u201d who published a piece for the New Yorker titled \u201cMissing Files Motivated the Leak of Michael Cohen\u2019s Financial Records\u201d \u2014 leaving little doubt that Farrow is the journalist referred to, since his is the sole byline on the article.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Avenatti, who was named in the indictment but who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, said he did nothing improper.\n\n\u201cNeither I nor R. Farrow did anything wrong or illegal with the financial info relating to Cohen\u2019s crimes (the courts have found that the BSA does not apply \u2014 see below),\u201c Avenatti wrote on Twitter, referring to the Bank Secrecy Act. \u201cAnd if we did (we didn\u2019t), then every reporter in America would be jailed and unable to do their job.\u201c\n\nFry was released on a $50,000 bond and is next scheduled to be in court on March 13.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect amount paid to Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about an affair she said she had with Donald Trump."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/florida-wisconsin-governors-convention-1179750", "text": "\"I think that Democrats have an extraordinarily large tent \u2014 people from all walks of life \u2014 and Milwaukee is absolutely the best place for them,\" said Wisconsin Gov.

Larry Hogan said Thursday he expects to make a springtime trip to New Hampshire as he weighs a 2020 challenge to Donald Trump \u2014 and accused the Republican National Committee of going to extraordinary lengths to shield the president from a potentially draining primary.\n\n\u201cTypically they try to be fair arbiters of a process and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it and I\u2019ve been involved in the Republican Party for most of my life. It\u2019s unprecedented. And in my opinion it\u2019s not the way we should be going about our politics,\u201d Hogan, a popular two-term Maryland governor, said in an interview with POLITICO. \u201cIt\u2019s very undemocratic and to say, \u2018We\u2019re in some cases not going to allow a debate, we may not have a primary\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAnd the question is, what are they afraid of?\u201d he added. \u201cBecause on the one hand you look at polls, 70 percent of Republicans support the president in a primary. Why are they so concerned? Why the puffing out the chest \u2014 \u2018We\u2019ve put together the greatest team ever assembled, we\u2019re going to raise all this money early, we\u2019re going to hire all these people early, we\u2019re going to take over the RNC\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring its annual winter meeting earlier this year, the RNC passed a resolution giving the president its \u201cundivided support\u201d ahead of the 2020 election. Trump has also rolled out a 2020 campaign organization that incorporates the RNC and his campaign into a single entity, with the reelection campaign and committee merging their field and fundraising programs into a joint entity known as Trump Victory. Traditionally, a presidential reelection committee has worked side-by-side with the national party committee but not overtaken it.\n\nThe arrangement, Hogan suggested, stemmed from worry on the part of senior Republicans that the president could be vulnerable to a primary challenge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a pundit and I can\u2019t put myself inside the heads of the people making the decisions, but perhaps the way things look today are not the way they think things look a few months from now or next week or six months from now,\u201d he added. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re concerned that they will drop in the polls and that they could be at some point down the road be subject to a threat in a primary.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

The unanimous resolution in support of the president\u2019s reelection at our winter meeting showed just that,\" said Cassie Smedile, a committee spokeswoman. \"Any effort to challenge President Trump in a primary is bound to go absolutely nowhere, as Governor Hogan acknowledges.\u201d\n\nParty officials have noted that it isn\u2019t out of the ordinary for the RNC to support an incumbent president, and point out that the committee passed a similar resolution backing then-President George W. Bush during his first term.\n\nThe 62-year-old Hogan, who won reelection in liberal Maryland last year, has openly flirted with a primary challenge in recent weeks. The governor used his January inauguration speech to implicitly go after the president and to raise the specter of impeachment. He later met with conservative columnist and prominent Trump critic Bill Kristol, who has been seeking out a 2020 Republican primary challenger.\n\nHogan\u2019s team has been in talks to appear at Politics & Eggs at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, which has long drawn presidential hopefuls. He said he expected to make a trip to the first-in-the-nation primary state sometime this spring. Aside from participating in Politics & Eggs, he also raised the prospect of meeting with the state\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Sununu. The two recently sat together at the Gridiron dinner.\n\nThe Maryland governor is slated to appear in Iowa early next month at an event sponsored by the National Governors Association, of which he serves as vice chairman. He said he would also set aside time to meet some people in the state before returning home.\n\nHogan, who in recent weeks has begun expressing interest in a potential primary bid, said he's heard from several Republican donors and elected officials. He's told them that he hasn't decided whether he'll run.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s been something of a feeding frenzy,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nHogan made the remarks ahead of an NGA meeting in Washington this weekend, an appearance that could bring him face-to-face with Trump. Hogan and governors from across the country are slated to visit the White House on Sunday for dinner. Governors will return on Monday for a meeting with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and other senior administration officials.\n\nThe president is also expected to appear at a Republican Governors Association dinner on Friday evening, an event Hogan is also expected to attend.\n\nHogan, who frequently mentions that his late father was the first Republican member of Congress to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, said he was in no rush to make a decision. A successful campaign, he argued, could start later on.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, I don\u2019t see any path to winning a Republican primary against this president, or anybody doing it.

Harris\u2019 campaign attorney said it was not intentional.\n\n\"Through the testimony I've listened to over the last three days, I believe a new election should be called,\u201d Harris said Thursday afternoon, after the board returned from a lunch break and closed session. \u201cIt has become clear to me that the public's confidence in the 9th District seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted.\"\n\n\"Neither I nor any of the leadership in my campaign were aware of or condone the improper activities that have been testified to in this hearing,\" Harris said.\n\nMcCready has been preparing for a new election for months, and within an hour of the board's vote, the Democrat blasted out a fundraising email asking supporters for donations. In the five weeks after he withdrew his concession, McCready raised $500,000, and he finished 2018 with $337,000 in his campaign account. Harris, meanwhile, had just $19,131 on hand at the end of 2018, according the latest FEC filings.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment the first vote was stolen in North Carolina, from the moment the first voice was silenced by election fraud, the people have deserved justice,\u201d McCready tweeted. \u201cToday was a great step forward for democracy in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear if Harris will run again. On top of health concerns, local GOP strategists said the fraud allegations surrounding his campaign may make it harder for Harris for raise money. A number of other Republicans are eyeing the seat, including Matthew Ridenhour, an ex-Marine who recently served as a Mecklenburg County commissioner, and Kenny Smith, a former Charlotte city council member who ran and lost for the mayor of Charlotte.\n\nHarris did not respond to reporters' questions about whether he would run again after the hearing on Thursday. Harris' wife said they would \u201chave to think about it,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nThe saga has left residents of the 9th Congressional District without a representative in Washington for months, and it will likely take a few more months before the new election wraps up. In 2018, Harris led McCready on election night by fewer than a thousand votes in the unofficial count, but the election board refused to certify the results, instead launching an investigation into allegations of fraud against Leslie McCrae Dowless, a political operative paid by the Harris campaign.\n\nWhile the National Republican Congressional Committee remained quiet about the ongoing scandal and does not weigh in on primaries, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is expected to throw its weight behind McCready in the new election.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen unfold in North Carolina is an all-out assault on our fundamental American values, and Mark Harris is correct when he said that his actions have undermined North Carolinians\u2019 faith in our election process,\u201d DCCC chairwoman Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to joining with countless others in this special election to do the hard work of repairing the harm Mark Harris, and Republicans in North Carolina, have caused.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/2277/1155968404_6005285785001_6005283574001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe investigation culminated in four days of hearings this week detailing the alleged collection and marking of voters' absentee ballots by Dowless and operatives paid by him.\n\nIn a dramatic twist on Wednesday, Harris' son took the stand unexpectedly and provided documents showing that he had warned his father about Dowless, the operative at the center of the election fraud scandal.

I have serious doubts about whether you\u2019ve learned any lesson at all,\u201d U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said near the end of a surreal 90-minute hearing, which was called in the wake of Stone\u2019s Instagram post on Monday that featured an image of the judge with what looked like gunsight crosshairs in the corner.\n\nUnder Jackson\u2019s new order, Stone can\u2019t make any public comments of any kind about the charges he\u2019s facing from the special counsel, which include lying to Congress and witness tampering.

I let myself down. I let my family down. I let my attorneys down. I can only say I\u2019m sorry. It was a momentary lapse in judgment. Perhaps I talk too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am kicking myself over my own stupidity, but not more than my wife is kicking me,\u201d he added.\n\nStone was already under a partial gag order that allowed him to continue discussing his case so long as he wasn\u2019t in or near the D.C. courthouse.\n\nBut since Jackson\u2019s decision last week, Stone has been anything but quiet. Besides his Instagram post, he has appeared on the conspiracy-theory site InfoWars and given multiple statements to media outlets to explain the flap and also take issue with their reporting about it.\n\nFrom the witness stand Thursday, Stone insisted that he didn\u2019t realize the crosshairs were in the photo until a reporter contacted him. He also explained that the crosshairs were actually a Celtic cross \u201coccult symbol\u201d but that he didn\u2019t know that until after it was posted.\n\nUnder questioning by Jackson about what the symbol meant, Stone replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, Your Honor. I\u2019m not into the occult.\u201d\n\nJackson didn\u2019t buy any of Stone\u2019s explanations. She repeatedly interrupted him while he was on the witness stand to ask questions, and her hand gestures and tone suggested incredulity at many of his responses. When she issued her opinion, Jackson said his apology \u201crings quite hollow.\u201d She also suggested that Stone would be responsible if his post caused others to act in threatening or harmful ways.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing ambiguous about crosshairs,\u201d she said.\n\nMueller\u2019s grand jury indicted Stone last month, charging him with misleading House Intelligence Committee investigators about his attempts to communicate with WikiLeaks during the election. The seven-count indictment also accused Stone of intimidating Randy Credico, a liberal radio host who is another witness in the Russia investigation.\n\nOn the witness stand Thursday, Stone said he was being treated for \u201cemotional stress,\u201d including from hearing TV commentators talk about how he\u2019d be raped if he were convicted and sent to prison. \u201cThis is a stressful situation for me and my family,\u201d he said.\n\nStone also noted that his income from consulting \u201chas dried up and is virtually nonexistent.\u201d He said he had drained his savings account and had turned to social media to hawk shirts that say \u201cRoger Stone did nothing wrong!\u201d as well as signed rocks, dubbed a \u201cRoger\u201d stone paperweight.\n\nWhile Stone looked dapper as usual \u2014 he wore a double-breasted gray suit with a blue striped shirt and navy tie \u2014 he also seemed subdued and there were signs that the testimony was testing his composure. As the judge bore down on him, he sounded somewhat rattled and his breathing became so heavy that it was clearly audible via the microphone.\n\nIn an attempt to explain the Instagram post, Stone told the court that he was not technologically savvy and frequently relied on a group of about five volunteers and staff to post on his social media accounts. He testified that he didn\u2019t select the image of the judge and didn\u2019t review it closely before it posted.\n\nUnder questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis, for example, Stone struggled to explain who had access to his social media accounts and phone and who specifically posted the image of Jackson.\n\nStone testified that it was a volunteer who selected the image but that he hadn\u2019t yet figured out who it was. \u201cNobody will own up to it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy house is like a headquarters. I have many volunteers,\u201d Stone explained.\n\nJackson interjected: \u201cI thought you said you had five.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive is a lot of coming and going,\u201d Stone replied.\n\nAs she ruled, Jackson faulted Stone for what she called his \u201cevolving\u201d explanation for the post. She noted that he initially told her that he \u201cdid not review\u201d the photo before it went out and did not select it. Minutes later, he said he \u201cdidn\u2019t review it properly.\u201d\n\nDuring cross-examination by Kravis, Stone offered up that he\u2019d been sent two or three images by a volunteer and picked one.\n\n\u201cYou had a choice?\u201d the judge asked incredulously.\n\nAfter slamming Stone for his actions, Jackson said it was her job \u201cto make sure this trial does not devolve into a circus.\u201d\n\nThe judge said Stone\u2019s decades of work as a public relations expert belied his claim that he didn\u2019t really know what he was doing when he put the post on Instagram. \u201cRoger Stone fully understands the power of words and the power of symbols,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nShe also seemed to agree with Kravis that Stone\u2019s repeated interviews defending the post contradicted his claim on the witness stand that as soon as he got the first media inquiry about the message, he realized the gravity of the mistake he\u2019d made.\n\nStone\u2019s lawyer, Bruce Rogow, argued during the hearing that his client\u2019s post did not violate the court\u2019s initial limited gag order or the terms of Stone\u2019s release. But the defense attorney also conceded that it was a terrible idea. \u201cIt is indefensible,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI agree with you there,\u201d the judge shot back.\n\nAs the case developed, legal experts had expected Jackson to gag Stone at the outset, given his outspoken style, his willingness to do media interviews and a prolific social media presence.\n\nJackson, an appointee of President Barack Obama, also hasn\u2019t responded well to anything in her courtroom that she perceives as showboating.\n\nShe slapped a gag order on Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, as well as Manafort\u2019s attorneys and his then co-defendant, Rick Gates, within weeks of their initial October 2017 indictment. She later jailed Manafort, a former Stone business partner, over allegations of witness tampering.\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing came amid signs that Mueller\u2019s office might wind down its operation as soon as next week. Indeed, Kravis, who is not on Mueller\u2019s staff, took the lead questioning Stone. However, a Mueller deputy, Jeannie Rhee, was also quite active during the session, repeatedly passing Kravis notes torn from a yellow pad and consulting with him as he cross-examined Stone.\n\nStone\u2019s appearance also had a heavy presence of courtroom security officers and federal marshals.

Many Venezuelans have flocked to the state as the country\u2019s economy crashed and repression increased.\n\nDemocrats, already alarmed that Trump\u2019s inroads with Venezuelans could help him peel off an otherwise-reliable Democratic voting bloc in a toss-up state, were quick to denounce Sanders\u2019 comments.\n\nFlorida Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on what's hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

He has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation,\u201d Rep. Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles and, told POLITICO. \u201cI absolutely disagree with his imprecision in not saying Maduro must go.\u201d Shalala has filed legislation aimed at helping Venezuelan immigrants.\n\nThe emerging issue hasn\u2019t yet spilled into the broader Democratic primary for president. Most candidates haven\u2019t weighed in, some by choice.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former Vice President Joe Biden, however, have clearly stated they consider Maduro a dictator and Guaid\u00f3 the legitimate leader of Venezuela. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren told Pod Save America that she believed Maduro was a dictator and suggested she supported the \u201cdiplomatic part\u201d of Trump\u2019s backing of Guaid\u00f3, though she faulted him for too much \u201csaber rattling.\u201d\n\nOne Democratic Hispanic consultant said the remarks will cause a needless \u201cfrenzy\u201d in South Florida\u2019s Hispanic community.\n\nSanders did not embrace Maduro in his Tuesday interview with Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, who quickly touched on Guaid\u00f3 being declared the interim president of Venezuela by the nation\u2019s National Assembly following Maduro\u2019s questionable election.\n\nBut when he was asked whether he recognized Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate leader of the country, Sanders answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\"There are serious questions about the recent election. There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election,\" Sanders added.\n\nIn a follow-up question, Ramos asked Sanders if he thought Maduro is a dictator who should step down. Sanders refused to say yes or no.\n\n\"I think clearly he has been very, very abusive,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cThat is a decision of the Venezuelan people, so I think, Jorge, there's got to be a free and fair election. But what must not happen is that the United States must not use military force and intervene again as it has done in the past in Latin America, as you recall, whether it was Chile or Brazil or the Dominican Republic or Guatemala.\u201d\n\nSanders also said that he believes \u201cthe United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThat comment puzzled Shalala. \u201cI do agree the international comm needs to come together and the U.S. needs to work with the international community,\" she said. \"But that\u2019s been happening.\u201d\n\nAfter Shalala posted her disagreement with Sanders on Twitter, the Vermont senator\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Ari Rabin-Havt, replied to her that \u201cthis view represents the long and horrific history of American politicians imposing their will on the people of Latin America. Bernie stands with the Venezuelan people to demand free and fair elections and for self-determination for all people around the world.\u201d\n\nRabin-Havt also noted Sanders has condemned Maduro.\n\nThe United States was the first to recognize Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s leader last month. About 64 other nations have followed. However, the United Nations still recognizes Maduro, though it has called for talks, as roughly 50 countries side with him \u2014 including U.S. foes Cuba, China, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia and Syria.\n\nSanders has long had sympathy for leftist governments. Once a self-described socialist \u2014 he now uses the term \"democratic socialist\" \u2014 Sanders has spoken favorably in the past about socialist and communist strongmen. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Sanders once said, wasn't \"perfect\" but \"totally transformed\" the country. And Nicaragua\u2019s leftist leader, Daniel Ortega, was \"an impressive guy,\" Sanders argued.\n\nOver the decades, Miami has become a home for exiles from some of those leftist governments, with Cuban-Americans leading the way and leaning strongly Republican. Venezuelans and Nicaraguans tend to vote Democratic once they become U.S. citizens and register to vote in Florida.\n\nBut Democratic consultants and community leaders say there\u2019s evidence that could change and that the GOP\u2019s anti-socialist messaging helped Republicans in 2018 and could help Trump in 2020.\n\nHelena Poleo, a Democrat who\u2019s a former journalist from Venezuela and is a Spanish-language commentator, called Sanders comments \u201cdisgusting. The Florida Democratic Party needs to denounce this now.\u201d\n\nThe state party made its position on Maduro clear, without mentioning Sanders by name.\n\n\u201cFlorida Democrats have been unequivocal: We recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the President of Venezuela, denounce the legitimacy of the Maduro regime and his efforts to remain illegally in power,\" the party said in a statement. Its comments echoed those of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who represents one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the United States.\n\nState Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Miami Democrat, said she was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d and believed Sanders wasn\u2019t properly briefed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously clueless,\u201d Taddeo said.\n\n\u201cSeems the Senator has already written Florida off his presidential campaign strategy,\u201d deadpanned Ric Herrero with the Cuba Study Group, which advocates for more engagement with Havana, an incidental ally of Caracas.\n\nOne of the state\u2019s top Democratic consultants for Hispanic outreach, former state party political director Christian Ulvert, said he was disappointed with Sanders for making such \u201cextremely ignorant\u201d comments. Ulvert, who\u2019s of Nicaraguan descent, said he found Sanders\u2019 comments harmful on a personal level as did his husband, who\u2019s from Venezuela and has relatives suffering under Maduro.\n\nThe day before Sanders\u2019 comments aired on Al Punto, Ulvert had written to the Democratic National Committee chairman concerning the location of the party\u2019s 2020 presidential convention and noted that Trump was trying to make inroads based on his anti-socialism message. Ulvert said \u201ceveryone in our party from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Joe Biden have recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the acting leader of Venezuela and said Maduro must go,\u201d and now Sanders is complicating that message.\n\n\u201cThis helps Trump and it makes our job harder as Democrats,\u201d Ulvert said. \u201cWhat this will do is whip into a frenzy South Florida\u2019s Hispanic community on both sides of the aisle. It\u2019s an unnecessary distraction.\u201d\n\n"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/mike-pence-venezuela-1179751", "text": "White House officials say Vice President Mike Pence has sometimes settled into a role as the administration\u2019s bad cop, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is the diplomat who sticks around to hash out particulars and President Donald Trump is the showman who swoops in from time to time. | Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty Images foreign policy Pence takes Trumpism abroad With three speeches on foreign soil in the last two weeks, the vice president has turned heads delivering Trump\u2019s 'America First' demands.\n\nVice President Mike Pence has slowly become of the president\u2019s most visible overseas surrogates \u2014 sent to deliver Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d demands.\n\nOn Monday, Pence will make his third speech on foreign soil in the last two weeks when he travels to Bogota, Colombia, to call on Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to step aside, a high-profile address that will come as the world watches to see whether Maduro relents on a blockade that has kept humanitarian aid packages from Venezuelans facing food and medicine shortages.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe request will come just days after Pence took a swing through Europe, where he broadsided allies with an unexpected demand that they pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal, while chiding them for continuing to do business with the country. Pence pointedly reiterated the dictates in a second speech, even after being issued a flat denial the first time around.\n\nOn the foreign stage, White House officials say Pence has sometimes settled into a role as the administration\u2019s bad cop, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is the diplomat who sticks around to hash out particulars and the president is the showman who swoops in from time to time.

Pence was the first senior Trump administration official to phone Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 the day before he declared himself interim president of the economically strapped country. In the weeks since, many Latin American countries and America\u2019s EU allies have followed the U.S. government in recognizing Guaid\u00f3 as the true Venezuelan leader.\n\nAnd in his speech Monday, Pence plans to reaffirm \u201cthe United States\u2019 unwavering support\u201d for Guaid\u00f3 just 48 hours after the opposition leader and more than 600,000 volunteers will attempt to bring humanitarian aid packages into the country that Maduro has been blocking at the border. Backed by a coalition of Latin American governments, Pence will declare that \u201cthe time has come for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to step aside,\u201d the White House said Thursday.\n\nIt will be Pence\u2019s fifth trip to Latin America since taking office.\n\n\u201cHe wants to keep the drumbeat going,\u201d a senior White House official told POLITICO, adding that both Pence and President Donald Trump believe the situation in Venezuela \u201ccould become the most significant foreign policy event of this administration.\u201d\n\nVenezuela is just one of myriad foreign policy issues Pence has folded into his portfolio.\n\nPence was the most senior official sent to a gathering on Middle East policy in Warsaw last week.\n\nAt the event, he diverged from his prepared remarks to call on the United States\u2019 European partners \u201cto withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\u201d Trump announced last year that the U.S. would exit the agreement \u2014 in which Tehran pledged to curb its nuclear program in exchange for economic sanctions relief \u2014 calling it a disaster for America.\n\nIn Warsaw, Pence accused European allies of undermining U.S. sanctions that were reimposed against Iran after Trump abandoned the accord, though he declined to namecheck Germany, France, or Britain for launching a mechanism last month that\u2019s designed to allow for continued trade with Iran. He reiterated the same talking points during a speech days later at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top leaders from around the world.\n\n\u201cIt is an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the [European Union] and create still more distance between Europe and the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was a moment that surprised foreign diplomats, who felt that Pence\u2019s remarks might actually embolden Iran, giving its officials easy attack lines. Indeed, Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif referenced Pence\u2019s Warsaw comments during his own speech in Munich.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel also picked up on the remarks, accusing the Trump administration of strengthening adversaries like Iran and Russia with its demands. Germany, France and the European Union had all declined to send their top diplomats to the Warsaw gathering.\n\nThe senior White House official said Pence\u2019s fiery comments were meant to signal the administration\u2019s move \u201ctoward a tougher stance against Iran, which includes pushing allies to withdraw\u201d from the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThe vice president used bilateral meetings in Munich and Warsaw to highlight not just the security threat posed by Iran,\u201d said the official, but to also challenge European allies on their business with a regime that has been known to \u201cstifle free speech, kill gay people and persecute political dissenters.\u201d\n\nPence has also occasionally popped up as a key player in the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing denuclearization negotiations with North Korea. It was his comparison of North Korea to Libya that drew fierce backlash from Pyongyang last May, temporarily jeopardizing a planned summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un \u2014 the showman aspect the president relishes. Trump will meet again with Kim next week in Vietnam for their second optics-heavy international summit.\n\nPart of the reason Pence enjoys such autonomy on the foreign stage is due, in part, to his proficiency at weaving profuse Trump flattery into his appearances, according to a former White House official.\n\nIn Munich, for instance, Pence spoke Trump\u2019s name 30 times, claiming at one point that \u201cunder President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership, America is leading the free world once again.\u201d In Warsaw, a transcript of Pence\u2019s speech shows 16 mentions of Trump by name, with four additional references to \u201cthe president.\u201d By comparison, then-Vice President Joe Biden mentioned President Barack Obama only once by name in his 2015 speech to the Munich Security Conference.\n\nBehind the scenes, Pence has even worked with president on developing and messaging the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy agenda.\n\nFollowing months and months of meetings with Christian leaders and national security experts, Pence successfully pressured administration officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development to funnel millions of dollars to Christian and Yazidi religious communities in Iraq that the Islamic State has decimated. The United Nations would have otherwise distributed the funds.\n\n\u201cI called it to [Trump\u2019s] attention that we could bypass U.N. programs and fund religious-based NGOs directly,\u201d Pence told the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview, adding that Trump agreed \u201con the spot.\u201d\n\nPence is expected to remain mostly in the foreign policy lane as the 2020 campaign draws more of Trump\u2019s attention and the administration works to broker a trade agreement with China and win Congress\u2019 approval of its renegotiated trade deal with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe vice president will help sell the U.S.-Canada-Mexico deal \u2014 which would update the NAFTA trade agreement \u2014 with Midwest swing in the coming weeks, according to two people familiar with his plans. The tour is expected to bring Pence to a host of farm towns and domestic manufacturing plants, where he will meet with small crowds and deliver remarks in an attempt to pressure Capitol Hill into swiftly passing the accord."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/trump-coast-guard-officer-1179749", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s silence is notable for a president who never hesitates to spout off about issues large and small. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images white house Trump stays silent on media-hating Coast Guard officer But when it comes to those insulting MAGA-ites, Trump relishes jumping in.\n\nWhen Chicago police accused actor Jussie Smollett of fabricating a story about being attacked by MAGA-loving bigots, President Donald Trump was quick to weigh in. \u201cWhat about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnd when Catholic high school student Nick Sandmann filed a lawsuit against The Washington Post this week over its coverage of last month\u2019s confrontation between the teenager and a Native American elder, Trump couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cGo get them Nick,\u201d he declared . \u201cFake News!\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut more than 24 hours after news broke that a Coast Guard officer \u2014 an avowed white nationalist \u2014 was allegedly plotting to kill Democratic politicians and journalists, Trump has, at least so far, not said a word.\n\nAsked for comment, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, \u201cThe president and the entire administration have condemned violence in all forms as we have stated many times.\u201d Sanders did not respond to questions about whether Trump planned to tone down his rhetoric.\n\nTrump\u2019s silence is notable for a president who never hesitates to spout off about issues large and small, from Venezuelan politics to \"Saturday Night Live.\" It reflects a deep sensitivity by the president and his aides to accusations that his verbal assault on the free press, personalized attacks on political targets and racially charged language could incite violence.

He also went after The Washington Post\u2019s fact checker, a section that tracks Trump\u2019s misstatements.\n\nPeople close to the president argue that Trump shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for the actions of a small group of disturbed individuals who happen to support him. And Trump\u2019s allies don\u2019t believe he has any intention of curbing his criticism of the press. They also note that some members of the Trump administration have been targeted by the president\u2019s critics, including Sanders, who was asked to leave a restaurant, and senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, who recently disclosed that she was assaulted at a restaurant last year.\n\nThe president regularly fumes in public and in private about negative coverage of him, and he also believes there\u2019s a political utility to undercutting the reporters who cover him, according to people who know him. It\u2019s a strategy he\u2019s been turning to most of his adult life, dating to his time in New York, where he would regularly engage with \u2014 and spar with \u2014 tabloid reporters.\n\n\u201cSo, to a large extent he does it naturally, but his use of the media is also a product of a deliberate strategy to advance his own ideas and undercut contrary narratives,\u201d the former White House official said.\n\nTrump has often avoided engaging in a fulsome debate about the impact of his rhetoric, including after Cesar Sayoc\u2019s October 2018 arrest for mailing a series of bombs to some of Trump\u2019s political opponents.\n\nAfter the incident, Trump called for unity during a rally in Wisconsin, saying, \u201cNo nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, coercion, or control. We all know that. Such conduct must be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted.\u201d\n\nBut the next day, he blamed the media. \u201cA very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description.

Though Trump tweets less overall as president than he did as a candidate, CPJ found that Trump tweets critical of the press have nonetheless increased during the first two years of his presidency.\n\nAt the same time, the number of journalists imprisoned around the world on false news charges has risen to 28, compared with nine two years ago, according to a December 2018 report from CPJ.\n\nEven U.S. journalists have faced violence and intimidation in recent months. In June 2018, a gunman killed five employees at the Capital Gazette in Maryland when he opened fire in the newsroom. CNN evacuated its New York office due to a bomb threat in December 2018. And earlier this month, a Trump supporter shoved a BBC cameraman at a rally.\n\nTrump has occasionally made light of some of these violent incidents, joking last fall about a Republican congressman convicted of assault for body-slamming a reporter.\n\nStill, most analysts are careful about directly blaming Trump for violence against journalists.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very difficult to draw a bright line between what comes out of the president\u2019s mouth or his Twitter account and action from other individuals,\u201d said Kathleen Bartzen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we should accept a normalization of this rhetoric.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s allies have pounced on journalists and others who were quick to connect Trump to the Smollett and Covington Catholic incidents, arguing that the president\u2019s critics are so eager to cast the president and his supporters in a negative light that they don\u2019t wait for all the facts to emerge.\n\nBut others haven\u2019t exhibited the same caution when it comes to finger-pointing.

Christopher Paul Hasson, who was arrested earlier this month, according to authorities. Others included MSNBC hosts Chris Hayes and Ari Melber, and CNN's Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo and Van Jones.\n\nScarborough and others have noted that news of the alleged plot to kill Democratic politicians and journalists broke just hours after New York Times publisher A.G.

His EPA biography notes that he was also head of the firm\u2019s \u201cAdministrative Law Group.\u201d\n\nWehrum convened his power plant industry clients on June 22 and 23, 2017, at his law firm\u2019s Washington, D.C., offices to lay out a road map for attacking the very policies he now oversees, the documents show. The roster of clients under the umbrella of the Utility Air Regulatory Group include some of the largest, most influential utility companies in the country. Wehrum told POLITICO he does not remember the two-day meeting, but a person familiar with the meeting and another who attended confirmed he was there.\n\nWehrum is certainly not the only person in Washington or the Trump administration to swing from lobbying to regulating. But the documents lay out an unusually clear picture of how Washington lobbyists steer a legal campaign for clients, keeping litigation churning while earning massive fees for their firms.\n\n\u201cI think the proximity of what he was doing in private sector advocacy then government work is a thing that distinguishes him from a lot of people and makes him vulnerable to criticism and questioning,\" said a former government ethics official.\n\nBy the time Trump had nominated Wehrum, he\u2019d already made millions for and from Hunton \u2014 his financial disclosure listed a $2.1 million partnership share in his last year at the firm. That form also lists the Utility Air Regulatory Group as one of 20 sources of his compensation surpassing $5,000, but only one UARG member \u2014 Salt River Project \u2014 is named individually.\n\nThe documents prepared for the group's June 2017 policy committee meeting laid out how much money Hunton & Williams was seeking for its work on behalf of the companies. It estimated an $8.8 million budget for 2018.\n\nOnce \u201cthe new leadership team at EPA is in place, if that team shows that it has the ability to address expeditiously many of the initiatives of greatest importance to UARG members \u2014 and if UARG wants to participate meaningfully in such initiatives \u2014 then UARG will likely need an overall year-2018 budget that is higher than this year\u2019s budget,\u201d it read.\n\nA month after the meeting, word began to circulate that Wehrum was headed to EPA, and by September, Trump made the nomination official.\n\nIt was unclear how far Wehrum was in his negotiations with the administration at the time of the meeting \u2014 he told POLITICO he was first approached in \"early 2017\" about the possibility \u2014 but he already had access to high-level EPA officials.\n\nMandy Gunasekara, then a top EPA air official, attended the UARG meeting at Wehrum's request.\n\n\u201cWe are interested in any Clean Air Act regulatory issue that you are willing and able to address,\u201d Wehrum wrote in an email to Gunasekara, according to separate documents obtained by the Sierra Club under the Freedom of Information Act. \"Topics of interest include the Clean Power Plan, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard, regional transport, regional haze, and NAAQS/NAAQS implementation. We are not asking you to address pending litigation on any of these issues. We are interested in discussing only possible future regulatory action.\"\n\nA person who was at the meeting confirmed both Gunasekara and Wehrum were there.\n\nWehrum told POLITICO that while he continued to work for Hunton for most of 2017, he \u201cbilled typically just a few hours a year to UARG.\u201d He said he\u2019s stayed within ethical boundaries because rules don\u2019t prohibit him from working on regulations that apply to a broad suite of players and he has not met with UARG since joining the EPA.\n\nWehrum has previously said he would recuse himself from litigation matters that he previously participated in, but not policymaking, such as regulation. He represented UARG in court as late as March 2017, when he filed a lawsuit over an Obama administration rule boosting chemical safety and reporting requirements at industrial facilities.\n\n\u201cUARG is an entity. It\u2019s a legal entity,\u201d he said, explaining that his clients were \u201cnot the individual members\u201d of UARG.\n\nWehrum recused himself for two years from decisions related to a Dominion Energy subsidiary, Duke and Salt River Project, but not any of the other UARG member companies, according to a September 2018 recusal statement to acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler.\n\nWehrum has in the past tried to firewall his work on litigation and policy, suggesting he would recuse himself from matters in which Hunton has represented clients in lawsuits challenging Obama-era policies. But the newly obtained documents show how deeply Hunton was involved in the cradle-to-grave formation of policy through UARG. For example, the June 2017 briefing materials cited \"possible participation in rulemaking activity\" among the services for which Hunton expected to bill the group's members.\n\nSince he was confirmed by the Senate in November 2017, Wehrum has undertaken many of the policies UARG identified as top priorities.\n\nFor example, the June 2017 UARG document says the group will \u201ccoordinate member efforts and strategy regarding EPA review and potential reconsideration of\u201d an Obama-era rule that justified major limits on mercury from power plant smokestacks by counting \u201cco-benefits\u201d from incidental reductions in other types of air pollution.\n\nThen, last December, after Wehrum joined the agency, EPA proposed changing the rule to disregard the co-benefits, aligning itself with the position UARG has taken since at least 2016. (The agency also opened the door to revoking rule entirely \u2014 something that would benefit the dirtiest coal plants in the country \u2014 although it says it has no immediate plans to do so.)\n\nAnother area of focus UARG outlined in June 2017 was \u201cpotential administrative actions related to the New Source Review program,\u201d a reference to permits that coal plants have to receive before conducting major upgrades.\n\nWehrum included major changes to that program as part of EPA\u2019s new carbon rule for power plants. The proposal would waive the New Source Review requirements for coal plants installing efficiency technology because the permitting costs would make the upgrades \u201cno longer viable,\u201d Wehrum told reporters last week. That change could allow coal plants to run more frequently, potentially increasing overall emissions even if the plant is more efficient.\n\nAnd in a separate move last November, Wehrum revived a New Source Review rule issued in the final days of the George W. Bush administration but halted by the Obama administration. The project \u201caggregation\u201d rule could help utilities avoid more stringent permitting requirements, and it is also listed as an action item on UARG\u2019s 2017 list.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, the main trade association for the nation\u2019s investor-owned utilities, foots most of the UARG bill, according to the newly obtained briefing materials. But UARG doesn\u2019t show up in any official documents \u2014 it has no tax identification number, no address, no incorporation filings. In lawsuits, UARG generally describes itself as a \"not-for-profit\" or \"ad hoc\" group of electricity generators without further describing its membership.\n\nUARG's structure allows it to avoid a paper trail. Utilities are dues-paying \u201cmembers\u201d of the organization. Many of those members, though, are also part of EEI. Rather than collect directly from companies, the briefing materials show that Hunton bills EEI directly \u2014 thus avoiding involvement of any formal entity known as UARG. EEI\u2019s 990 filings with the IRS, which nonprofits file annually, show a more than $8 million \u201cconsulting\u201d tab for Hunton dating back years, making up more than half of the trade organization\u2019s independent contractor services.\n\n\u201cEEI provides accounting services to groups such as UARG and participates in a number of coalitions covering a range of issues important to our members,\" EEI spokesperson Brian Reil said in a statement to POLITICO. \"UARG provides a variety of services to its members, including regulatory, technical, and compliance advice and information. EEI does not participate in any votes on UARG policy matter decisions. EEI files our own comments on the issues that are important to our members and their customers.\"\n\nThe names of the UARG members are some of the biggest in the business, along with some of the largest consumers of coal.\n\nThe documents show that 25 companies that are EEI members \u2014 including AEP, Ameren, Dominion, DTE Energy Co., Duke, FirstEnergy Corp., NiSource, South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. and Southern Co. Services \u2014 accounted for $6.8 million in 2017 dues to UARG.\n\nOrganizations that have backed efforts to soften pollution and climate regulations account for the remaining $1.4 million in dues: American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, American Public Power Association, EEI, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and the National Mining Association. The Tennessee Valley Authority also paid $462,967 in dues that year, according to the documents.\n\nWehrum thus can have a significant effect on keeping business flowing to his old firm through regulatory maneuvers that affect the power industry. Some companies have already questioned whether some of Wehrum\u2019s moves are necessary. Redoing the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, a pollution rule that most utilities already have spent millions complying with, tops that list. UARG member Duke, for example, has publicly criticized EPA\u2019s decision to revisit that rule.\n\nIn an interview, Wehrum cited EPA's work on the mercury rule as one area where his policies have diverged from the wishes of some UARG members. \u201cI\u2019m not going to put words or thoughts into anybody\u2019s mouth,\u201d Wehrum said of UARG, but he added, \u201cI know at least a lot of individual member companies wanted to go the other way.\u201d\n\nGiven that Hunton participates both in regulatory comment periods and litigation, Wehrum\u2019s old firm would be slated to be involved in every step of the policy process. The June 2017 UARG document lists specific budget allocations for various programs, such as climate change, pollution control technologies, hazardous air pollutants and regional air quality.\n\nWehrum told POLITICO he believes he's doing things by the book.\n\n\"I don't believe anybody has gotten special access because they\u2019re a friend of mine,\" he said."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/prosecutors-violated-law-jeffrey-epstein-1179120", "text": "A new ruling makes numerous mentions of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta\u2019s involvement in the mishandling of Jeffrey Epstein's case, while Acosta was serving as U.S. attorney for Southern Florida. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Legal Judge: Prosecutors violated law in dealings with Jeffrey Epstein victims\n\nA judge ruled on Thursday that federal prosecutors broke the law by failing to keep victims adequately informed about a plea deal that Jeffrey Epstein, a prominent financier, cut to avoid federal prosecution for sexual encounters with numerous underage girls.\n\nLabor Secretary Alexander Acosta was the U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at the time the agreement was negotiated more than a decade ago. The Justice Department\u2019s internal watchdog for attorney misconduct announced earlier this month that it had opened an investigation into the government\u2019s conduct in the case.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra said Thursday that prosecutors violated the Crime Victims Rights Act by failing to notify victims before signing off on the arrangement, under which federal prosecutors promised not to prosecute Epstein in federal court if he pleaded guilty to a pair of prostitution-related offenses in a Florida state court.\n\n\u201cPetitioners and the other victims should have been notified of the Government\u2019s intention to take that course of action before it bound itself under the NPA,\u201d or nonprosecution agreement, Marra wrote.\n\nKeep up with POLITICO Playbook The 2020 Election.

While the Government spent untold hours negotiating the terms and implications of the NPA with Epstein\u2019s attorneys, scant information was shared with victims. Instead, the victims were told to be \u2018patient\u2019 while the investigation proceeded.\u201d\n\nEvidence in the case showed that for years Epstein dispatched aides and associates to find teenage girls, many of them underage, to visit his Palm Beach home for \u201cmassages\u201d that often involved sex acts. Epstein wound up with an 18-month sentence. He was cut loose five months early, and much of the time he did serve was under lax conditions in which he was on work-release during the day.\n\nMarra\u2019s 33-page ruling makes numerous mentions of Acosta\u2019s direct involvement in the case, including his face-to-face negotiations with Epstein\u2019s attorneys. Critics of the deal have said federal prosecutors were outmatched by Epstein\u2019s well-connected, high-powered defense team, which included former independent counsel Ken Starr and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz.\n\nThe Labor Department declined to comment on the judge\u2019s ruling or the specifics of the case.\n\n\u201cFor more than a decade, the actions of the office in this case have been defended by the Department of Justice in litigation across three administrations and several attorneys general,\u201d a Labor spokesperson told POLITICO. \u201cThe office\u2019s decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed departmental procedures. This matter remains in litigation and, thus, for any further comment we refer you to the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Justice Department in Washington referred a request for comment to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Miami, which declined to offer any statement on the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nBrad Edwards, an attorney for the victims, said in a statement: \u201cToday\u2019s order represents long-overdue vindication for all of the victims of Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators. Unfortunately, this decision also highlights the failure of the United States Government to acknowledge its obvious wrongdoing. Rather than work to correct the injustices done to the victims, the Government spent 10 years defending its own improper conduct. It is time for the Government to work with the victims, and not against them, to hold everyone who committed these crimes accountable.\u201d\n\nMarra\u2019s decision came in a lawsuit that some of Epstein\u2019s victims filed in 2008 seeking to have the nonprosecution deal nullified because of the treatment of the victims. In the ruling Thursday, the judge left open the question of what remedy should be imposed for the prosecutors\u2019 legal violation in their handling of the deal.\n\nThe basic facts of the case have been established for years, but a Miami Herald report last November, including videotaped interviews with some of Epstein\u2019s victims, drew new attention to the episode and prompted Democratic lawmakers to demand an investigation."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/20/trump-william-barr-mueller-1176832", "text": "poster=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/171/1155968404_6005239170001_6005235632001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true \u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous man and tremendous person who really respects this country and respects the justice system.

The approach comes as Trump\u2019s inner circle is signaling that it believes the special counsel has essentially completed his work.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous man and tremendous person who really respects this country and respects the justice system. So that\u2019ll be totally up to him,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office Wednesday when asked about a new CNN report that Barr is preparing to announce the completion of Mueller\u2019s work as soon as next week.\n\nLast week, at the close of meandering remarks in the Rose Garden, Trump similarly praised Barr. \u201cI want to wish our attorney general great luck and speed \u2014 and enjoy your life.\u201d\n\nAnd notably, Trump didn\u2019t take the bait when Barr praised outgoing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein just one day after Trump debased Rosenstein, accusing him of being part of a rogue, lawless group within the Justice Department.\n\nThe president\u2019s efforts to play nice with Barr stand in contrast to his ever-growing list of grievances, which piled up on Twitter again this week. Trump called The New York Times the \u201cENEMY OF THE PEOPLE,\u201d he picked a fight with The Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker, he called on California to return federal money it spent on the state\u2019s high-speed rail network and he bashed the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Edgar Hoover,\u201d referring to the controversial first FBI director, in the latest escalation of his offensive against McCabe, whose book has yielded wall-to-wall cable news coverage.\n\n\"I think Andrew McCabe has made a fool out of himself over the last couple of days,\" Trump said.\n\nKeep up with POLITICO Playbook The 2020 Election.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nA number of reports have also detailed Trump\u2019s mounting frustrations with intelligence chief Dan Coats following a congressional appearance in which Coats countered Trump\u2019s frequent boasts about North Korean negotiations and defeating ISIS.\n\nTrump has been obsessing over the Mueller investigation since it began in May 2017, and he has grown sensitive to any suggestion that he could be implicated in the special counsel\u2019s final report. The president\u2019s lawyers have also been clamoring for the Mueller investigation to end for as long as there\u2019s been a Mueller investigation, with the White House and the president\u2019s lawyers incorrectly predicting its conclusion on numerous occasions.\n\nThey\u2019re hoping this time is different.\n\n\u201cAs far as I can tell the investigation is over,\u201d Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told POLITICO last Friday. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten everything they\u2019re going to get. There\u2019s nothing hanging out there that is big where they haven\u2019t gotten the information, gotten the answers, gotten the documents. We satisfied the document requests a long time ago. It\u2019s all there for them to make a decision.\u201d\n\nAs for Mueller\u2019s timing, Giuliani said he didn\u2019t want to ascribe any significance to Barr\u2019s arrival and the larger transition in leadership atop DOJ as Rosenstein readies to leave the government in March.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t read anything into that other than the fact that I think it will run its course and they\u2019ll present whatever they have to the Justice Department,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nMueller\u2019s office and the DOJ declined to comment on the timing of the probe.\n\nUnder the Clinton-era DOJ guidelines Mueller is operating from, the special counsel must submit a report to the attorney general when his probe is complete, spelling out who he\u2019s prosecuted and who he declined to prosecute.\n\nAs Trump noted on Wednesday, it\u2019s the attorney general\u2019s decision from there as to what he wants to make public. Barr said during his Senate confirmation hearing that he would likely allow a summary but not the entire report. He added that he would make his version as thorough as possible under the law but would not commit to sharing Mueller\u2019s report in its entirety.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from combating the probe at almost every turn. A Tuesday New York Times report detailed two years of presidential efforts to \u201cdefang\u201d the various investigations encircling him. In one noticeable instance, Trump leaned on acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to put a Trump-appointed official in charge of a New York-based federal investigation into hush money payments made during the campaign to women who claimed to have had sex with Trump.\n\nThe story set off Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Press has never been more dishonest than it is today. Stories are written that have absolutely no basis in fact. The writers don\u2019t even call asking for verification. They are totally out of control,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday. The Times says its reporters gave the White House five days to respond to its story.\n\nTrump has continued to unleash a torrent of disdain toward Mueller and his investigation, which he portrays as a partisan character assassination. \u201cThe Mueller investigation is totally conflicted, illegal and rigged! Should never have been allowed to begin, except for the Collusion and many crimes committed by the Democrats. Witch Hunt!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday.\n\nBut inside the White House, many staffers have grown numb to the flood of Mueller-related news, believing they have little choice but to ignore the ever-present headlines and cable news chyrons and focus on their jobs.\n\nSpeculation over when Mueller will finish his report into Russian interference in the 2016 election has only increased as hints of an upcoming conclusion have surfaced recently. Late last month, Whitaker told reporters the investigation would come to a close soon. CNN reported Wednesday that the finished report could be announced next week. Trump will be in Vietnam next week for a second summit with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un.\n\nTrump officials aren\u2019t sure what will happen after Mueller notifies Barr that his work is done. While there have been more than 20 other special counsels in the post-Watergate era, no one has been assigned the job of investigating a president and his winning campaign for everything from collusion with a foreign power to obstruction of justice in a bid to halt the underlying investigation.\n\nAides acknowledge the handoff is uncharted territory, and it\u2019s far from clear how the sequence will play out to notify Trump, his legal team and its staff when the probe is finished.\n\nThe attorney general could conceivably notify anyone from senior White House aides \u2014 chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House counsel Pat Cipollone or his deputy, Emmet Flood \u2014 or the president himself. Giuliani said it\u2019s possible Mueller could turn in his findings without getting any heads-up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect to be notified when they do whatever they have to do with the Justice Department,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI expect to be notified either when the DOJ makes their decision or when the DOJ wants to publish something so we can look it over to see if we have executive privilege issues.\u201d\n\nPeople close to the president have begun privately wondering how long Barr can stay in Trump\u2019s good graces, especially if sensitive details of the Mueller report are leaked to the press.\n\nBarr has made it clear that he wants to be independent from the White House. During his confirmation hearing, Barr said he would allow Mueller to complete his work and said he wouldn\u2019t follow through with a directive to fire Mueller without cause.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear that Mueller is on the cusp of closing up shop on his probe, which has snagged guilty pleas from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates; former national security adviser Michael Flynn; and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Most recently, Mueller brought charges against longtime Trump associate Roger Stone, with a high-profile criminal trial in Washington, D.C., possible later this summer or fall.\n\nMueller has taken steps to hand off some of his caseload to federal prosecutors. But there are other competing signs that suggest the special counsel still has work to do: Mueller\u2019s office has confirmed it\u2019s locked in a mysterious Supreme Court battle over a subpoena involving a company owned by a foreign country; FBI agents collected reams of evidence and potential leads when it executed a search warrant on Stone\u2019s home and office late last month; and multiple congressional committees have referred interview transcripts to the special counsel for review for potential perjury charges.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to all things Mueller, the number of experts on tasseography is stunning,\u201d said Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor from Virginia.\n\n\u201cI thought the once-popular practice of reading tea leaves ended after the Victorian Era,\u201d he added. \u201cFor me, I like to flip a coin for the answer to whether Mueller is ending. At least I have a 50 percent chance of being correct. My coin tells me that Mueller is far from done.\u201d\n\nMatthew Choi contributed to this report."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/miami-democratic-national-convention-bid-1176840", "text": "Underpinning Miami\u2019s pitch: I i t\u2019s the heart of the largest Democratic county in the nation\u2019s biggest swing state. | Lynne Sladky, File/AP Photo Florida Florida aims to torpedo Milwaukee 2020 convention bid Miami is mounting a furious lobbying blitz to win over Dems.\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Miami fears the fix is in.\n\nLocal Democrats increasingly believe that the Democratic National Convention in 2020 will be sited in Milwaukee, Wis., a conclusion that\u2019s led Florida politicians, donors and insiders to mount a final lobbying blitz to turn the tide.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe last-ditch effort began in earnest in recent days as speculation mounted that Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez would pick Milwaukee, where he has both family ties and the pressure of the Democratic governors of Wisconsin and Illinois weighing on him to go with a Midwestern location.\n\nPerez has denied making up his mind or favoring any of the three finalist cities, a shortlist that includes Houston.\n\nStill, the state\u2019s Democratic congressional delegation has been pressed into service to persuade him.

Donna Shalala of Miami, who was Perez\u2019s boss when she was President Bill Clinton\u2019s health secretary, personally spoke to him about the Miami bid at a dinner hosted by former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, Paul Cejas, a major Democratic donor. A former Justice Department colleague of Perez, former South Florida U.S. Attorney Willy Ferrer, has chimed in as well.\n\nThe singer-songwriter couple Gloria and Emilio Estefan have also lent their star power and former New York Yankee Derek Jeter, now a part-owner of the Miami Marlins, has been \u201cvery eager\u201d to help make his new club\u2019s baseball stadium available for the convention, said a source.\n\nJoe Falk, a major South Florida donor involved in supporting Miami\u2019s bid, said Miami should be able to sell itself because it\u2019s multi-ethnic, gay-friendly and a place where donors are much more likely to open their wallets than Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cHow do you get the donor to dig deeper? Show him a good time,\u201d Falk said. \u201cThe donors are here and we know how to treat donors. We have the facilities to make those incredibly wealthy people comfortable. And we know how to throw a good party.\u201d\n\nAnother top Democratic donor from Miami who didn\u2019t want to be identified said he\u2019s already being besieged by presidential hopefuls for contributions. And he\u2019s making sure to press the issue of Miami\u2019s convention bid.\n\n\u201cIf you want Florida\u2019s support, you should support Florida. It\u2019s a simple message,\u201d the donor said. \u201cYou hear people say \u2018Florida, Florida, Florida.\u2019 They don\u2019t say \u2018Wisconsin, Wisconsin, Wisconsin.\u2019 There\u2019s a reason for that.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just stars, ambassadors and high-rollers helping out. UNITE HERE, a hotel-worker union, is calling Perez, DNC members and other top Democrats to boost Miami\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cFor our union in particular, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d said Wendi Walsh, a UNITE HERE international vice president. \u201cFor this DNC, we\u2019ve got almost 4,000 union hotel rooms here in South Florida compared to zero in Milwaukee.\u201d\n\nWisconsin officials note, however, that they have a far-more union-friendly state than Florida.\n\nWalsh, who said the public employee union AFSCME is also being engaged, said there\u2019s a purely political dimension to the effort: \u201cFlorida matters a lot, and we want to win Florida.\u201d\n\nThe convention would help inject a sense of energy into South Florida that could help cure the liberal bastion\u2019s longtime turnout problems, which have led Democrats to lose recent statewide elections by about a percentage point or less, according to a Wednesday letter to Perez written by Christian Ulvert, a top Democratic consultant who has advised Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber and his predecessor, Philip Levine, a co-chair of the convention effort with Korge.\n\nUlvert noted that Trump on Monday campaigned in Miami as part of an outreach effort to court voters of Venezuelan heritage and shore up support among Cuban-Americans.\n\n\u201cRepublican strategy has been to maximize gains outside of South Florida and erode our support here,\u201d Ulvert wrote. \u201cFlorida is ground zero for presidential elections \u2014 Miami-Dade is clearly ground zero for Florida.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/news/florida", "text": ""}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/donald-trump-north-korea-1178593", "text": "Reps.

Cole.\n\nSwiftly following William Barr\u2019s confirmation to serve as attorney general, the White House announced its intention to nominate Jeffrey Rosen, the current deputy secretary of Transportation, to replace Rod Rosenstein as deputy attorney general of the United States.\n\nOn paper, it seems like a good fit. Rosen\u2019s academic accomplishments, legal aptitude and Washington experience place him squarely on a level with any smart, savvy attorney under consideration for the job, one of the most important in Washington. He\u2019s no Matt Whitaker; Rosen comes across, at first blush, as a legitimate, well-credentialed attorney capable of taking on a serious job in Washington at the highest level of the United States government. Given that the Senate has already confirmed him for his current role, he should be easily confirmable for the new post.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut none of that means Rosen possesses the appropriate qualifications to serve effectively as the deputy attorney general. Unlike Rosenstein and many before him, he lacks prior Justice Department experience and\u2014critically\u2014has zero prosecutorial experience.\n\nThe deputy attorney general oversees day-to-day operations and policies of the entire DOJ, a sprawling institution of more than 107,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $28 billion. The department includes the litigating divisions such as the Civil Rights Division, Criminal Division, Antitrust Division, National Security Division, Civil Division, and the Environmental and Natural Resources Division. The deputy supervises all 93 United States attorneys and their work around the country, as well as immigration judges. DOJ also includes the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, United States Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons. For someone completely new to DOJ, managing all that will require a steep learning curve.\n\nThe deputy role is widely known as the hardest job at DOJ, regardless of the administration. In ordinary times, the attorney general is known as the show horse, whereas the deputy is known as the work horse, given the breadth of evaluation, level of detail and careful consideration that all matters hitting the DAG\u2019s office must undergo en route to the AG and the White House. For someone who is new to DOJ, its ways of doing business, and its central importance to any White House, this job is far more demanding than Rosen\u2019s current position at the Department of Transportation.\n\nNothing in Rosen\u2019s background suggests he is incapable of rising to the challenge. With a Harvard law degree, years as a litigator at the prestigious law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, and impressive government stints as general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Transportation during the George W. Bush administration, it\u2019s not surprising that Rosen earned a top post overseeing the daily operations of the Department of Transportation for the past couple of years. His legal and management chops are obvious.\n\nBut what should give the Senate pause in evaluating his nomination is that the head of the Criminal Division, the head of the National Security Division, the director of the FBI, the administrator of the DEA and all of the U.S. attorneys will report directly to a potential DAG Rosen who, if confirmed, will lack any meaningful experience over the subject matter for which they are seeking his approval and guidance. This dynamic puts Rosen at an enormous disadvantage for getting up to speed and for quickly gaining DOJ staff credibility and respect because he has had no exposure to, for example, wiretaps, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, criminal laws on discovery \u2014 all matters that require extraordinary levels of judgment and wisdom under pressure.\n\nServing as the deputy attorney general is akin to drinking from a firehose on any given day. Over a three-month period in 2013, my former boss, James M. Cole, faced the Boston Marathon bombing and the Edward Snowden leak. Both incidents threatened our security as a nation and caused enormous reverberations throughout the country and the world. Day after day for months, these criminal and national security events dominated the attorney general, DAG, FBI and White House leadership\u2019s schedules. Imagine overseeing and reacting to those investigations and threats while familiarizing oneself with an unfamiliar national law enforcement agency, without the benefit or knowledge of a background in criminal law or national security. Rosen easily could face such significant events, all while navigating an unpredictable White House intent on undercutting the very department Rosen will be trying to run.\n\nIn effect, Rosen will be learning how to fly a plane while actually flying the plane, but with one arm tied behind his back. In any era, the typical day-to-day schedule requires the DAG to attend meetings and reviews of complicated, sensitive and extremely serious criminal and national security matters. Rosen\u2019s scant track record in these areas makes him vulnerable; he will be incredibly dependent on his career and political staff, as well as on the judgment of those who report to him. Lacking independent experience, Rosen will be evaluating serious and sensitive information at the mercy of others\u2019 interpretations, while possessing the power to make uninformed, and potentially dangerous, decisions.\n\nRosen\u2019s plight is not unprecedented; former DAG Jamie Gorelick did not possess DOJ experience or criminal prosecution experience, and former DAG David Ogden lacked prosecution experience. In less volatile times, a complete novice at DOJ faces an enormously steep learning curve. But here, during an unusually fraught period for the rule of law, Rosen\u2019s lack of expertise places him and DOJ in a bind. It\u2019s hard enough for any member of DOJ leadership to push back against a White House, but it\u2019s even harder to change minds or advocate without pulling from one\u2019s personal experience, gut or judgment on topics of national or international significance. Consider the tightrope Rod Rosenstein has had to walk with this White House with the benefit of 25-plus years of DOJ prosecutorial experience, as well as prior experience in the DAG\u2019s office. It\u2019s not luck\u2014Rosenstein has skillfully navigated this White House and the Mueller probe, while largely preserving DOJ\u2019s independence and integrity, precisely because he has that intimate knowledge and familiarity with DOJ precedent to stand firm upon.\n\nWhile Rosen may be capable and smart, placing someone with no institutional knowledge and without the experience related to DOJ\u2019s core mission, represents yet another assault on the Justice Department as an institution. I hope Rosen treats DOJ with the reverence it deserves, and which Rosenstein has given it under excruciating circumstances. But I don\u2019t know how he can."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/21/trump-california-attacks-economy-225191", "text": "Michael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.\n\nPresident Donald Trump loves bashing California\u2014its \u201cridiculous\u201d sanctuary cities, its \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d of its forests, even the \u201cdisgusting\u201d streets of San Francisco.

Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk has warned that \u201cDemocrats want California to be the blueprint for America,\u201d while Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, has suggested that Trump\u2019s reelection slogan should be: \u201cI\u2019m not going to let the Democrats turn America into California.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCalifornia has earned its reputation as the politically correct capital of Blue America, a heavily urban majority-minority coastal state where it\u2019s legal to smoke pot but illegal for retailers to provide plastic bags or cops to ask suspects their immigration status. Taxes are high, the first year of community college is free and driver\u2019s licenses have a third option for residents who don\u2019t identify as male or female. But while California has plenty of problems, from worsening wildfires to overpriced housing to that troubled bullet-train project that became the latest target of presidential mockery, there\u2019s one serious hitch in the GOP plan to make California a symbol of Democratic dysfunction and socialistic stagnation: It\u2019s basically thriving.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is doing awesome,\u201d says Congressman Ted Lieu, an immigrant from Taiwan who co-chairs the policy and communications committee for the House Democratic Caucus. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, welcoming, environmentally friendly place that proves government can work. Who wants to run against that?\u201d\n\nCalifornia is now the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, up from eighth a decade ago. If it\u2019s a socialist hellhole, it\u2019s a socialist hellhole that somehow nurtured Apple, Google, Facebook, Tesla, Uber, Netflix, Oracle and Intel, not to mention old-economy stalwarts like Chevron, Disney, Wells Fargo and the Hollywood film industry. California firms still attract more venture capital than the rest of the country combined, while its farms produce more fruits, nuts and wine than the rest of the country combined. During the Great Recession, when the state was mired in a budget crisis so brutal its bond rating approached junk and it gave IOUs to government workers, mainstream media outlets were proclaiming the death of the California dream. But after a decade of steady growth that has consistently outpaced the nation\u2019s, plus a significant tax hike on the wealthy, California is in much sounder fiscal shape; while federal deficits are soaring again, the state has erased its red ink and even stashed $13 billion in a rainy day fund.\n\nOf course, every state is in better economic shape than it was during the Great Recession, but California has enjoyed its renaissance while pursuing policies Republicans associate with economic ruin. It has an $11-an-hour minimum wage, scheduled to rise to $15 by 2023. Its unusually aggressive implementation of Obamacare since 2013 has reduced its uninsured rate from 17 percent to just 7 percent. Its ambitious clean energy and climate policies in many ways inspired the Green New Deal; the state is committed to generating 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 100 percent by 2045, and its stringent fuel-efficiency standards help explain why it\u2019s home to half the nation\u2019s electric vehicles.\n\nIn general, California is flourishing while pursuing the exact opposite of the policies Trump is pursuing in Washington. And it has sued the Trump administration dozens of times, not only taking the lead on the new 16-state lawsuit against the president\u2019s emergency wall declaration, but fighting for loan forgiveness for students defrauded by for-profit schools, net neutrality and Obamacare\u2019s guarantees of free birth control, while fighting to stop the ban on travel from several Muslim countries, the ban on transgender service members, and a slew of environmental rollbacks. For example, Trump is trying to dismantle California\u2019s strict fuel-efficiency rules, which have become de facto national rules since other blue states have adopted them and every automaker has complied with them, and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is now battling the administration in court to protect them.\n\n\u201cIf people want to call what California is doing socialism, fine, but it isn\u2019t having a negative impact on the economy,\u201d says political scientist Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Center for Budget and Policy. \u201cBy just about every measure of productivity, we\u2019re at the upper end of the spectrum.\u201d\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Republicans from making California their go-to nightmare scenario. In 2018, Senator Ted Cruz warned that liberals wanted Texas to be \u201cjust like California, right down to the tofu and silicone and dyed hair.\u201d Democratic candidates for governor were accused of trying to turn Nevada and Florida into California, and Colorado into \u201cRadiCalifornia.\u201d In the Georgia governor\u2019s race, Republican Brian Kemp\u2019s stump-speech mantra about Democrat Stacey Abrams was that she was trying to import \u201cradical California values.\u201d The Republican National Committee\u2019s nickname for Harris in its news releases is \u201cCalifornia Kamala,\u201d and it rarely mentions her without mentioning her \u201cSan Francisco values.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is so gigantic that it\u2019s hard to pinpoint what its values really are. There are huge differences between its cities, exurbs, and rural areas, between crunchy Northern California and glam Southern California, between upscale coastal California and downscale inland California. But it\u2019s undeniably a socially and politically progressive state, with laws banning pet stores from selling dogs that weren\u2019t rescued, restaurants from giving their customers plastic straws unless asked, and employers from asking job applicants about their current salaries. Even the traditionally Republican suburbs of Orange County voted Democratic in 2018. And while economic conservatives consider its high-tax, pro-regulation policies \u201canti-business,\u201d researchers have not found evidence that those policies drive businesses to other states or squelch innovation in California, although they do seem to encourage some retirees to move elsewhere. The president tweets on a platform created in California. It\u2019s somewhat odd to portray the state that created health clubs, blue jeans, Pandora and Hulu as Venezuela in the making.\n\nIn fact, the secret sauce of the California dream seems to have something to do with attracting entrepreneurs who want to change the world as well as their bank accounts. Christine Moseley, the CEO of a San Francisco business-to-business startup called Full Harvest, was an executive for a global logistics conglomerate and then an organic juice chain before moving to the Bay Area to start an eco-friendly company of her own. She ended up developing a kind of Airbnb for ugly produce, a platform that connects farmers who have fruits and vegetables they can\u2019t sell to grocery stores with juice companies and other buyers who don\u2019t care what the food looks like as long as it\u2019s fresh. America wastes about 40 percent of its food, contributing to global hunger as well as global warming; in three years, Full Harvest has sold 10 million pounds of produce that would have gone to waste.\n\n\u201cCalifornia was the perfect place to do this,\u201d Moseley says. \u201cIt\u2019s the tech and innovation capital of the world, but it\u2019s also the place for people who care about food and the environment, and the place for people who want to solve big problems.\u201d\n\nA lot of those dreamers come to California from abroad; more than 10 million of the state\u2019s 40 million residents are immigrants, and a quarter of those immigrants are undocumented. \u201cThere is a Revolution going on in California,\u201d Trump tweeted during the legal battle over sanctuary cities last April, and he didn\u2019t mean it as a compliment. In his Oval Office address about his border wall last month, the president pointedly cited two murders committed by undocumented immigrants in California, and earlier this week he complained on Twitter this week that California is leading the fight against his declaration of a national emergency.\n\nBut illegal border crossings into California are at their lowest level since 1971, and the state government doesn\u2019t view its undocumented residents as a threat. They\u2019re eligible for driver\u2019s licenses, subsidized health care for their kids, and in-state tuition rates, while police officers are prohibited from working with ICE to try to deport them. University of California Chancellor Janet Napolitano, who ran the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama, created legal services centers throughout the system to help undocumented students.\n\n\u201cCalifornia recognizes their basic humanity,\u201d says Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis law school. \u201cAnd if you look at the labor market, immigrants are a big reason why California has such a dynamic economy.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, another reason has been government investment; for example, the strength of its public universities helped attract the aerospace industry, build the technology mecca of Silicon Valley, and turn the San Diego area into the national capital of \u201cprecision medicine.\u201d But government also helped finance the ill-fated solar manufacturer Solyndra, as well as the beleaguered San Francisco-to-Los Angeles bullet train that Governor Newsom tapped the brakes on last week. Newsom is also scaling back a similarly massive water project designed to alleviate droughts and protect the Sacramento River delta. Sometimes Republicans cite misleading statistics to make California look bad\u2014yes, it has the \u201cmost debt\u201d and the \u201cmost families on welfare,\u201d because it has the most people\u2014but sometimes, California\u2019s dreams have exceeded its government\u2019s ability to execute them.\n\nThere has been no need to exaggerate California\u2019s most serious problem, the exorbitant housing costs that threaten its middle class and, as Newsom warned in his State of the State address, are starting \u201cto define life in this state.\u201d The state\u2019s highest-priced cities have blocked development of new housing through zoning restrictions and not-in-my-back-yard activism; a five-year-old plan to build 75 mixed-income apartments in San Francisco\u2019s hip Mission neighborhood was just delayed again after opponents sought to protect a laundromat on the lot as a historic landmark. California\u2019s poverty rate is near the nation\u2019s average, but by a separate measurement that takes housing costs into account, it\u2019s tied for the nation\u2019s worst. Overall, California has dropped to 49th in the nation in per-capita housing supply, a trend Newsom has vowed to reverse; he has already begun suing California cities that don\u2019t meet state-mandated affordable housing goals.\n\nBut while the problem of unaffordable housing is a real drag on growth, and a real threat to the social and economic mobility that drives the California dream, it\u2019s the kind of problem that only desirable places have. There\u2019s plenty of affordable housing in Siberia. \u201cWe attract people that places like Mississippi can\u2019t,\u201d Lieu boasts. Nancy Pfund, a Bay Area venture capitalist and \u201cimpact investor\u201d who took early stakes in Tesla and Pandora, says California is still a magnet for talent, because it\u2019s still a breeding ground for disruption. She\u2019s now investing in local companies like Zola Electric, which is taking Silicon Valley solar technology to Africa; Apeel Sciences, which has created natural plant-based coatings that keep produce fresh for longer, attacking the food waste problem in a different way; and even the Real Real, the luxury consignment platform that helps consumers recycle their brand-name fashion and reduce the demand for manufacturing more of it.\n\n\u201cIn California, we\u2019ve got the combination of capital, innovation, and regulations that reward investments in progress,\u201d Pfund says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s created an ecosystem of entrepreneurs who want to spread the progress around the world.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s talking about entrepreneurs like Dawn Barry, the president of San Diego-based LunaDNA, a community-based Big Data genomics platform powered by blockchain, which is a very California collection of words. Basically, it\u2019s a way for people to get paid for sharing medical data from genealogy services like 23 and Me as well as their iPhones so researchers can study them. It\u2019s complicated, but it\u2019s the kind of startup that makes sense in a place like San Diego, which has big research institutions like Sanford Burnham Prebys, Scripps and UC San Diego, big tech companies like Qualcomm, and big genomics players like Illumina, where Barry was a top executive.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just this attitude here that we\u2019re going to reshape medicine,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody thinks it\u2019s crazy that you want to do things totally differently.\u201d\n\nThat attitude didn\u2019t work out for Solyndra\u2019s cutting-edge solar panels that looked like mini-ladders instead of rectangles, or for the high-speed rail project that started construction in the sparsely populated Central Valley in the middle of the line rather than the dense urban centers at the endpoints. California\u2019s cap-and-trade program for reducing carbon emissions has gotten off to a bumpy start, too, and its leading electric utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, declared bankruptcy after the wildfires.\n\nSo the idea of California as a leftist hellhole is likely to persist. \u201cCalifornia is going to hell in a handbasket,\u201d Fox News personality Tomi Lahren declared during a recent segment on the border. A conservative Town Hall columnist, in a 2018 essay titled \u201cTo Hell With California,\u201d urged the state to secede from the U.S., although he said he didn\u2019t want to nuke it. (\u201cWell \u2026 OK, I don\u2019t.\u201d) There\u2019s already a Twitter meme proposing a new Harris campaign slogan: \u201cMake America California.\u201d\n\nCalifornia does feel like a potential harbinger of a more multicultural, more progressive American future, which may be one reason Trump is so openly hostile to it, even threatening to withhold aid from its wildfire victims. A lot of Newsom\u2019s plans for California are to counter what\u2019s happening in Washington; he wants to reinstate Obamacare\u2019s individual health insurance mandate in California, extend health subsidies to undocumented adults in California, and pursue even more ambitious climate goals. Meanwhile, the Democratic candidates to take on Trump are pushing platforms that would take a lot of California policy to the national stage.\n\nThe story of California is the story of America\u2014immigration, innovation, investing in what works,\u201d Lieu said. \u201cPlus we\u2019ve got amazing beaches, and Disneyland! How cool is that?\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/20/bernie-sanders-left-2020-225190", "text": "Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images opinion Can Bernie Sanders Survive the Modern Left?\n\nRich Lowry is editor of National Review and a contributing editor with Politico Magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders catalyzed the Democratic Party\u2019s post-Obama move to the left.

No one would be as committed to the party\u2019s new, socialist-inflected policy agenda than the guy who came up with much of it in the first place.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut among the flaws on Sanders\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for many progressives is one that he can do nothing about\u2014he is a white male, and an old one. In the language of the modern left, the straight, cisgendered Sanders is burdened by his utter lack of intersectionality.\n\nIt\u2019s a symptom of the delicacy of the situation that in attempting to talk his way around this gross status offense, he has caused even more offense.\n\nIn his announcement interview on Vermont Public Radio, he was pushed on how he can lead a diverse Democratic Party. Sanders cited the famous Martin Luther King Jr. quote about judging people by the content of their character and replied, \u201cWe have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age. I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society, which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.\u201d\n\nFor expressing this support for a nondiscriminatory society, a sentiment that would have been considered jejune just a few years ago, Sanders was roundly denounced.\n\nNeera Tanden of the Center for American Progress thundered on Twitter, \u201cAt a time where folks feel under attack because of who they are, saying race or gender or sexual orientation or identity doesn\u2019t matter is not off, it\u2019s simply wrong.\u201d\n\nFormer Clinton aide Jess McIntosh chimed in, \u201cThis is usually an argument made by people who don\u2019t enjoy outsized respect and credibility because of their race, gender, age and sexual orientation.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert snarked, \u201cYes, like Dr. King, I have a dream\u2014a dream where this diverse nation can come together and be led by an old white guy.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a first-time offense on Sanders\u2018 part, either. He said much the same thing in a GQ profile, and also earned rebukes, including one from his former press secretary Symone Sanders. \u201cAs a young black millennial,\u201d she told CNN of his remark, \u201cI don\u2019t like hearing it because it speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding about race and gender and what people are looking for.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I categorically reject pretty much everything Sanders believes, but what he is getting at here should be uncontroversial, indeed banal. Of course, it is important and desirable that we look beyond the demographic characteristics of candidates, to their views and their merits. Do we really want to live in a society in which no one can represent people different from them?\n\nConsider where this leads. Given a choice between Sanders and the free-market Republican Tim Scott for president, do progressives want African-Americans to vote for Scott? Should Bobby Kennedy, lionized for decades for his unifying campaigning, be retroactively deemed just another straight white male who had to get out of the way? Do we let ourselves slide into a society of Shiites and Sunnis, merely conducting a census every election cycle by voting for our own regardless of any other consideration?\n\nAnyone who looks at, say, Steve Forbes and Sanders and thinks, \u201cOh, just a couple of white guys,\u201d is disregarding every political and philosophical difference in favor of a racialist reductionism.\n\nThe sniping at Sanders (some of it motivated by lingering bitterness over the 2016 primary campaign) is especially bizarre given his long history of advocacy of civil rights, including his attendance at the 1963 March on Washington.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Sanders is dismissing diversity. In the GQ interview, he said how important it is, and set out his vision for his movement: \u201cMy main belief is that we need to bring together a coalition of people\u2014of black and white and Latino and Asian-American and Native American\u2014around a progressive agenda which is prepared to take on an extraordinarily powerful ruling class in this country.\u201d\n\nOnce upon a time, this would have been considered a welcome, inclusive view. Today, Sanders is seen as retrograde by the identity-politics hall monitors who increasingly rule the Democratic Party.\n\nThe root of the problem is that Sanders is an old-school socialist who attributes primacy to a class struggle that crosses racial boundaries, rather than to race (or gender or sexual orientation) as such. A highly intellectual and starker version of his worldview can be seen in Adolph Reed, the University of Pennsylvania professor who complains, as he put it in an interview last year, \u201cAny claim or proposal concerning durable patterns of economic inequality is now taken as being tantamount to making excuses for white supremacy.\u201d\n\nIf Sanders ever said anything like that, he\u2019d have to drop out of the campaign the next day. It\u2019s an odd turn of events when unreconstructed socialists are, in at least this one respect, more broad-minded than the Democratic Party. But it\u2019s true, and Sanders will have trouble living it down.\n\n"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/20/how-trump-could-win-2020-225165", "text": "Matthew Dallek, associate professor at George Washington\u2019s Graduate School of Political Management, is author, most recently, of Defenseless Under the Night: The Roosevelt Years and the Origins of Homeland Security.\n\nFor the past 3\u00bd decades, a glaring paradox has infected the quest for the American presidency. In an age when citizens on both left and right have soured on politics and treated incumbents with thinly veiled contempt, sitting presidents have rarely been booted out of office before their eight years were up. They have survived, despite the raging animus toward incumbents. The only president since 1984 to have failed to win a second term has been George H.W. Bush in 1992.\n\nWhy? One significant reason is that opposition parties have generally nominated bad candidates to challenge presidents running for second terms. Of course, incumbents have built-in advantages, including their claims to a growing economy, their use of the bully pulpit to pulverize their opponents, and their skill at blaming Congress for stymieing the people\u2019s will. But it\u2019s also true that opposition parties have nominated a string of enfeebled candidates who have greased the path to reelection for incumbent presidents. If Democrats want to have a shot at unseating President Donald Trump in 2020, they should avoid making the same mistakes again.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nConsider the failed presidential challengers since 1984: Walter Mondale, Bob Dole, John Kerry and Mitt Romney. This list shows that, in the modern era, Republicans and Democrats alike have tended to prioritize decades of government experience or deep party ties ahead of far more salient characteristics and considerations like youthful energy and fresh ideas. Rather than selecting future-oriented/anti-establishment candidates to carry their party\u2019s banner, opposition parties have tended to nominate politicians next in the queue\u2014leaders who have paid their dues by raising gobs of money for other partisans, building chits among activists and elected officials, and incubating relationships with Iowa and New Hampshire political operatives.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/3884/1155968404_6002306400001_6002305149001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThis has been a mistake. Maybe these candidates would have made good, or perhaps even great presidents\u2014and we\u2019ll never know whether better nominees could have ousted the incumbents these candidates challenged\u2014but these candidates were weak. They all lacked appeal to an electorate that loathes longtime politicians, and they were brought down at least in part by defects associated with a stale politics rooted in their parties\u2019 respective pasts. (The electorate might dislike longtime pols, but given a choice between two establishment candidates, one incumbent and one challenger, incumbent advantage wins.) They show us how parties can become ossified, reliant on their longtime leaders, and how primary voters and partisan leaders can blind themselves to the demands of the political moment.\n\nIn general elections, voters have tended to punish experienced candidates with records of legislative achievement inside the Beltway. Somewhat perversely, the most deserving, qualified nominees have had a harder time winning than their far less qualified competitors. And in those elections since 1984 when incumbency has been out of the question, and two new candidates have run against one another, the forward looking/anti-establishment candidate has won every time with one exception\u2014George H.W. Bush, who in 1988 tore apart Gov. Michael Dukakis as an unpatriotic, soft-on-crime, pro-Big Government Massachusetts liberal. (Although Dukakis was ostensibly the anti-establishment candidate in the race, Bush tarred Dukakis with the brush of 1960s liberalism and pegged him as an establishment throwback to an earlier era.) In 2008, Barack Obama, then a first-term senator, defeated the far more experienced John McCain (in fairness, almost any reasonable Democratic candidate would have prevailed given George W. Bush\u2019s two unpopular wars and the Great Recession), and in 2016 Donald Trump assailed \u201cstupid\u201d politicians and the infinitely more qualified and knowledgeable nominee Hillary Clinton as emblematic of a \u201ccorrupt establishment.\u201d\n\nThe converse has also held true when, in 1976 and 1980, opposition parties did pick forward-looking/anti-establishment nominees who were able to defeat incumbents. In 1976, Jimmy Carter\u2014his slogan was \u201ca leader, for a change\u201d\u2014vowed to \u201cclean up the mess in Washington\u201d and ousted President Gerald Ford, who had taken office after the resignation of his disgraced predecessor, President Richard M. Nixon, and saved him from possible criminal conviction by pardoning him. Four years later, the shoe was on the other foot. Although he had served as California governor for eight years, Ronald Reagan claimed the outsider mantle by pitching himself to voters as \u201ca boy growing up in several small towns in Illinois\u201d who had \u201cseen America from the stadium press box as a sportscaster, as an actor, officer of my labor union, soldier, office-holder, and as both Democrat and Republican.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am what I always have been, and I intend to remain that way,\u201d Reagan insisted when a reporter asked him whether he was repositioning himself in the political center in anticipation of his White House run.\n\nUltimately, though, the candidates who failed to unseat incumbents since 1984\u2014the bipartisan Mondale-Dole-Kerry-Romney quartet\u2014underscore this anti-establishment dynamic and hold special relevance heading into the Democratic 2020 primary contest. Romney is arguably the most glaring example of how a weak challenger can hobble the opposition party as it seeks to unseat an incumbent. Although Trump has tweaked Romney for having failed to work hard enough in that campaign (a \u201cchoke artist,\u201d he called him), Romney\u2019s far deeper problem was that he became the personification of the age of economic inequality\u2014the greedy, win-at-all-costs corporate raider who grew super-rich on the backs of struggling families. The problem was as much his longtime affiliation with the most elitist elements in the Republican Party as it was with Wall Street. Romney had had only limited government experience, serving four years as Massachusetts governor. Still, as the son of former Michigan governor and GOP presidential candidate George Romney, Mitt Romney had deep party roots. As the country struggled to rebuild after the Great Recession, Romney seemed someone out of central casting from the GOP of yore\u2014a 1930s-era titan of capital who helped define the party as pro-industry, anti-worker and dismissive of middle-class Americans. His nomination made it easier for President Barack Obama to win reelection by opposing what he said was Romney\u2019s elitist, backward-looking economic approach.\n\nIn 1996, former Senate Majority leader Dole failed to capture the hearts of the anti-Clinton right, came off as temperamentally cranky, and ran on a noble record of war service in a time when the Cold War had ended and voters prioritized other qualities in their presidents. Above all, Dole was quintessentially a wheeler-dealer, a career legislator and party man to his core who had scant rationale for what his presidency would mean for most Americans. Lambasting Clinton as morally deficient (\u201cBozo\u2019s on his way out!,\u201d Dole assured one supporter after an October campaign rally in New Jersey), Dole communicated a bitter sense that Clinton\u2019s moral defects had disqualified him for a second term\u2014the antithesis of hope and change.\n\nReagan would have been tough to defeat in 1984 no matter whom Democrats had nominated. The economy was beginning to expand after a recession and tensions with the Soviet Union had diminished from the height of Reagan\u2019s bombast and the war scares with the Soviet Union in 1983. Still, Mondale was easily caricatured as an unapologetic liberal with a static vision born of 1960s-Big Government activism that voters had at least in part rejected in Reagan\u2019s 1980 victory. Having served as Carter\u2019s vice president and as a senator from Minnesota, Mondale ran on what he described as his government \u201cexperience\u201d and his record as \u201cthe most active and influential vice president in history.\u201d On Election Day, he carried only his home state and Washington, D.C., in the Electoral College.\n\nPerhaps the strongest of the four challengers in question was Kerry, and he prosecuted with ardor the argument that Bush\u2019s occupation of Iraq had failed. Yet his political experience and legislative record also became an albatross for him. He had served as a senator for decades, had voted for war in Iraq, and Republicans used his antiwar Vietnam activism and his patrician mien and background\u2014a \u201cwise man\u201d knowledgeable in foreign affairs and a symbol of his party\u2019s establishment\u2014to depict Kerry as vaguely anti-American. His career and social class played into Bush\u2019s structural advantage in the election as the incumbent commander in chief during wartime and made it easier for the Bush campaign to cast Kerry as unprincipled and a candidate of yesterday.\n\nWhat does this recent history reveal about the Democratic Party\u2019s prospects going into 2020? Trump plans to run for reelection by attacking \u201ccertain Democrats\u201d and \u201cpoliticians\u201d who refuse to aid \u201cwomen and girls \u2026 tied up in the back seat of a car or a truck or a van\u201d in what he falsely labeled an immigrant-fueled crime wave, as he argued in his Friday remarks from the Rose Garden declaring a national emergency. Running against Washington may not be as easy for Trump as he wishes it to be. His norm-shattering presidency has squandered one of the advantages incumbents traditionally have enjoyed, as he has failed in his first term to convince a majority of the public that the president is actually presidential. So it is thus conceivable that a nominee with deep experience\u2014think former Vice President Joe Biden\u2014might well be a safe harbor in a Trump-induced Category 5 storm. It\u2019s not crazy to envision at least some significant slice of the electorate seeking a candidate with policy knowledge, Washington experience and a stable character, bucking the trends of the past four decades.\n\nAt the same time, the opposition party\u2019s ignominious record since 1984 should factor into any assessment of what is shaping up to be the deepest, most diverse crop of Democratic presidential candidates ever. The quartet of failed challengers reminds us that an electorate deeply hostile to Washington politicians will likely look askance at any Democrat whose legislative and political achievements define their quest for the American presidency. Democrats will need someone skilled at tapping people\u2019s frustration with politics, someone credible on the central question of income inequality, someone who can speak to the party\u2019s future rather than someone beholden to its past. Sadly, nominating the most qualified person to be president may squander a chance\u2014perhaps the biggest since 1992\u2014to oust an incumbent president."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/19/trump-national-emergency-border-wall-225164", "text": "Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Law and Order Has the Supreme Court Already Decided the Wall Case? Another recent case mirrors the litigation challenges to the wall\u2014and Trump won it.\n\nAziz Huq teaches law at the University of Chicago and is author of How to Save a Constitutional Democracy.\n\nWe\u2019ll \u201csee you in court.\u201d So said California Governor Gavin Newsom hours after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation of emergency to redirect funds to a southern border wall without the consent of Congress. California, along with 15 other states, filed that suit on Monday. The advocacy group Public Citizen didn\u2019t even wait until close-of-business on Friday to sue. The American Civil Liberties Union lags not far behind.\n\nBut what if the script and the endings for these lawsuits have already been written? What if following that script means these suits challenging the emergency as beyond the president\u2019s fiscal powers will do nothing to enlarge Congress\u2019 control over the federal purse? What if instead it has the main effect of giving Trump an electoral boost in 2020?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor there is another recent case that tracks, issue-for-issue and beat-for-beat, the filed and impending litigation challenges to the wall\u2014and Trump won it.\n\nThat earlier case is the challenge to Trump\u2019s travel ban. Like the wall, the travel ban fulfilled a 2016 campaign promise. Like the wall, the ban on entry by citizens from Muslim-majority nations was challenged within days. If the legal challenges to the wall anticipated in Trump\u2019s Friday Rose Garden speech arrived quicker, it simply shows that all concerned have settled comfortably into a predictable dance of provocation and resistance. The travel ban litigation ended in a 5-4 decision in the U.S. Supreme Court, upholding the policy mere months before Americans returned to the polls in 2018.\n\nThe parallels between the travel ban and the wall cases are too precise and too plural to be ignored. Even if you think the court\u2019s endorsement of the travel ban is wrong\u2014as I have argued\u2014it would be a grave error to ignore its predictive quality.\n\nTo begin with, both the travel ban and emergency funding for the wall rest on Trump\u2019s reliance upon a very broad delegation in a federal statute. In both cases, that is, an earlier Congress voluntarily handed over wide-ranging power for presidents to respond to novel circumstances. In both cases, the president has used this power to double down on hardening the border in line with his campaign rhetoric.\n\nNot only is the president\u2019s legal theory in the two cases alike, the arguments against the president\u2019s two policies also run along parallel tracks. Those arguments have two parts.\n\nFirst, in both cases there also are powerful arguments that Congress did not anticipate the kind of policy Trump has pursued\u2014a blunderbuss border control bearing down hardest on nonwhite migrants. The statutory delegations given by Congress in the two cases, to be sure, may have been broadly written. But neither the immigration provision at issue in the travel ban case nor the military construction provision in the wall case is a blank check: In both cases, there were conditions that the president likely failed to satisfy. When the president reallocates spending to the wall, for instance, he is supposed to show under the statute that the wall is \u201cnecessary\u201d to support the armed forces. It is not easy to see how he shows this.\n\nSecond, in both cases the president\u2019s own words about his reasons for declaring an emergency\u2014his admission that the declaration was a strategic political decision and thus not necessarily brought on by a real emergency\u2014and the data released by his own administration fatally undermine the factual justifications for emergency, unilateral action. In February 2017, the Department of Homeland Security\u2014hardly the heartland of a bureaucratic \u201cresistance\u201d\u2014concluded that citizenship in banned nations was \u201clikely an unreliable indicator\u201d of terrorism risk. Data from the same department today shows an 80 percent decline in Border Patrol apprehensions on the southern border since 2000. The number of families presenting at the border has also declined since last year.\n\nSo what will the Supreme Court do when confronted by (1) the president\u2019s invocation of a broadly worded statute, (2) to enact a scattershot, arguably racialized form of border control, (3) where there are colorable arguments that the president has not satisfied the statute\u2019s triggers for extraordinary action, and (4) in any case, the executive\u2019s own words and data show that the policy is unwarranted?\n\nHere\u2019s an answer using only a few choice quotes from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the revised and slightly narrowed travel ban: It would start by observing that the statutory basis for the wall \u201cexudes deference to the president in every clause.\u201d It would build on this by asserting that \u201cthe admission and exclusion of foreign nationals\u201d is a \u201cfundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government\u2019s political departments largely immune from judicial control.\u201d\n\nThen the kicker: If the policy\u2019s challengers point to the president\u2019s own statements on Friday, or his own past conduct in the context of budget negotiations to show that there is no border emergency, or that the real motive at work is to fulfill a campaign promise with 2020 in mind, the court would then remind them, again quoting the travel ban decision, that it is not \u201cthe statements of a particular president,\u201d but rather \u201cthe authority of the presidency itself\u201d that is at issue. In effect, the court here said that it would refuse to take Trump at his word, and instead ignore evidence of either flawed motive or insufficient justifications. English law had a Latin maxim that nicely captures the court\u2019s thought here: \u201crex non potest peccare,\u201d or the king can do no wrong.\n\nUnder this doctrine, the fact that the president\u2019s aim of circumventing Congress\u2019 control of appropriations is arguably unconstitutional matters no more than the president\u2019s expressions of animus mattered in the travel ban case.\n\nIn this manner, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion from last year can be applied point for point to the statutory and constitutional arguments against the wall emergency proclamation. The expected result is that the president prevails. The Brett Kavanaugh confirmation makes this only more likely given the new justice\u2019s record of voting in favor of expansive presidential powers.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I am no fan of the wall. My point is not that the Supreme Court\u2019s travel ban decision is correct. Rather, it is probative of the justices\u2019 likely action: A court that aggressively evades real opportunities to parry presidential lawlessness will once again look away. Racial and ethnic minorities, never winners in the Roberts court, will again lose out.\n\nThe real winner from the litigation, I think, will not be Congress. Nor will it be \u201cthe presidency itself.\u201d If Democrats hope to pursue their own immigration priorities through the same means when a Democrat takes the White House, they may well not have the same luck. The Roberts court showed itself capable of intense skepticism of a Democratic president\u2019s immigration initiative when it almost invalidated President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, which granted work permits and deportation stays to thousands of noncitizen parents. Lawyers can carve an explanation for its different treatment of Obama\u2019s and Trump\u2019s policies. Results, though, speak louder than casuistry. I have little doubt that the Roberts court, and future courts, will continue to find in the case reports enough material to uphold policies perceived as desirable, while invalidating policies perceived to be undesirable.\n\nRather, the winner from this litigation will be the \u201cparticular president\u201d who sits in the Oval Office now: The Supreme Court, if it follows the script set by the travel ban case, may well let him pursue his immigration policies unhindered.\n\nThere\u2019s another potential upside for him: The timing of the judicial review will likely ensure that the wall case, like the travel ban case, immediately precedes the 2020 election. (The present solicitor general has been very aggressive about fast-tracking cases to the Supreme Court. Just last Friday, he succeeded in getting the court to fast-track a challenge to the Trump administration\u2019s addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census.) The travel ban was supported by a \u201cclear majority\u201d of Americans. And though the wall lacks similar support, a decision validating it may well be a boon to candidate Trump in the crucial months before the 2020 poll. Of course, it may also have the opposite effect, energizing liberals and sending them to the polls in droves.\n\nSo with both sides digging in, the fighting seems more a matter of political theater than legal principle. Given the strong signals of which way the Supreme Court is likely to rule, moreover, it\u2019s a play that should generate little or nothing by way of suspense. Just a dismaying sense that season two is pretty much the same tale told in season one.\n\nThis article tagged under: Donald Trump"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/19/trump-national-emergency-225163", "text": "Andrew Harnik/AP Photo in the arena The Real National Emergencies Trump Is Ignoring By focusing on the border, the president is distracting us from the greater threats facing America.\n\nJanet Napolitano, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2013, is president of the University of California. She is author of the forthcoming book, \u201cHow Safe Are We?: Homeland Security Since 9/11\u201d with Karen Breslau.\n\nIn its landmark report condemning the U.S. government\u2019s failure to prevent the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the 9/11 Commission noted that the \u201cmost important failure was one of imagination.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration to fund a border wall may go down as the opposite: the triumph of one man\u2019s imagination over reality.\n\nTrump\u2019s vision of the southern border as a lawless region teeming with immigrants, gangs, drug dealers, gun runners, human traffickers and terrorists trying to burst through and harm the U.S. and its citizens underlies his insistence on a wall as the sine qua non of homeland security. This approach amounts to a willful misreading of the true threat landscape facing the U.S. nearly two decades after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHere are the facts about the 1,933-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico: illegal crossings are the lowest they\u2019ve been in decades. Technologies like sensors and drones are being deployed to enhance the capabilities of the Border Patrol and are receiving increased funding in the recently signed appropriations bill. And all but around 50 miles of border barriers identified by experts as necessary have already been constructed. The small remainder crosses either private land or lands held by sovereign Indian nations, making their suitability for barrier construction doubtful.\n\nThe supposed national emergency at the southern border also makes little sense in the post-9/11 era, in which our adversaries can infiltrate our society and our institutions through digital networks, armed Americans kill more Americans through acts of mass violence than ISIS does, and the emergent ravages of climate change threaten every community in the U.S.\n\nBy declaring a national emergency to fund a border wall, Trump is diverting financial and military resources and the attention of policymakers to prepare for threats that are far more real, pervasive and deadly. He also is impeding the public\u2019s ability to understand the likelihood of threats against which they need to protect themselves.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was created after the 9/11 attacks and assigned a mammoth portfolio of national security, law enforcement and public safety responsibilities. DHS is responsible for immigration and border security, including not only our border with Mexico, but also with Canada, as well as all land, sea and airports of entry, 328 in all. It\u2019s worth noting that 2018 statistics from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection show that the majority of illegal drugs enter through one of these legal ports of entry.\n\nDHS manages nearly two dozen major government agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Citizenship and Immigration Services and a workforce of 240,000 employees. It leads the federal response for all natural and human-caused disasters, oversees the cybersecurity of the government\u2019s nonmilitary data networks, and protects of critical infrastructure\u2014the energy, financial and communications networks that underpin the U.S. economy and the voting systems that are supposed to secure our democracy.\n\nHomeland security is a matter of assessing risks and assigning resources to mitigate them in proportion to the likelihood they would occur. Every hour spent on photo ops related to the border wall is an hour not spent on other mission-critical tasks that matter far more to making America safe. News of the resignation of the acting FEMA director Brock Long last Wednesday was overtaken by border wall coverage within hours, yet his job touches many more Americans made vulnerable by increasingly severe natural disasters. And the president said nothing about the nearly three dozen school shootings since 17 were killed at a high school in Parkland, Florida, just over a year ago.\n\nAs the third secretary of Homeland Security, I thought deeply about my tenure and focused on one question in particular: How safe are we today? The threats we face have evolved significantly since Sept. 11, 2001, when the smartphone had not been invented and social media was the arcane province of geeks. Today\u2019s terrorists, both foreign and domestic, recruit adherents online, inspiring them to radicalize and commit acts of violence, but Trump\u2019s claim before last November\u2019s midterm elections that they were infiltrating migrant caravans from Central America and Mexico and heading to the U.S. border is widely understood to be inaccurate. It is undercut by government data showing that of the 3,755 actual or attempted entries by known or suspected terrorists into the U.S. in fiscal year 2017, few attempted entry via Mexico.\n\nMore Americans have died or been displaced by extreme weather events related to climate change since 2001 than by terrorists, foreign or domestic. If Trump wants to build a wall to make America safe, he should start with a seawall.\n\nThe public understands these realities far better than Trump does. A poll released this month by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that climate change is the top security concern of people in 13 of 26 countries surveyed, including the U.S. More than 60 percent of respondents across all countries viewed cyber-attacks as a serious concern, up from 54 percent in 2017. And the number of countries that saw the Islamic State as a primary threat fell by double-digit percentage points in the U.S., Israel, Spain and Japan.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission urged the creation of the DHS to prevent another catastrophe on American soil. To do that, we must face today\u2019s facts, apply our will, and spend our resources to create a future that truly makes Americans safe."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/17/white-male-democrats-2020-225101", "text": "Bill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d\n\nOf the nine candidates officially running in the Democratic presidential primary, only one is a heterosexual white man. And that guy, former Rep. John Delaney, generally polls somewhere between zero and 1 percent.\n\nBut of the 17 Democrats reportedly still pondering a presidential bid, all but one is a straight white man. It\u2019s hard to chalk that up to coincidence. Clearly, the women and minority candidates sensed that the water is warm for them, and the straight white men appear to be worried that this is just not their year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCNN\u2019s demographic number cruncher Ron Brownstein noted recently that the percentage of the Democratic primary electorate who are women, nonwhite voters and\u2014\u201cthe most liberal component\u201d of the party\u2014college-educated white voters are all on the rise. The 2016 Democratic primary electorate was 58 percent women, 38 percent nonwhite voters and 37 percent college-educated white voters, all numbers that could be bigger in 2020, and strongly suggest a hospitable environment for candidates who embody a diverse America.\n\nDoes this mean that Democratic Party voters are so obsessed with identity politics that they are shutting straight white men out of the party? No. Who have been the top two candidates in nearly every primary poll? Not just two straight white males, but geriatric ones: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are the two oldest straight white men in the lot. In the most recent POLITICO/Morning Consult Democratic presidential primary tracking poll, the straight white male candidates, largely driven by Biden and Sanders, combined to garner 64 percent of the vote. Biden and Sanders are holding the top slots with the help of double-digit support among African-Americans, Latinos and women, showing that it remains possible for a white male Democratic candidate to knit together a diverse coalition.\n\nStill, the straight white men\u2014including Biden and Sanders\u2014are not being irrational by hesitating. Yes, they are risking a loss of media buzz, A-list staff and access to donor networks by allowing others get a head start. But they have good reason to tread carefully. Issues pertaining to race and gender are bound to be prominent in the campaign, and white men do not exactly have the best track record of dealing with them.\n\nPossible independent presidential candidate Howard Schultz sparked a thousand cringes when, after being asked about racist incidents at Starbucks cafes, he unconvincingly insisted, sounding like Stephen Colbert\u2019s old Comedy Central parody of a right-wing TV host, \u201cI honestly don't see color.\u201d Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, struggling to restore his reputation in the wake of the blackface scandal, stumbled again when he referenced the \u201cfirst indentured servants from Africa\u201d and received this sharp retort from CBS\u2019 Gayle King: \u201calso known as slavery.\u201d Whatever defense you might want to make for these responses, the fact remains that precise language matters when discussing discrimination and bigotry, and a candidate who comes across as clueless, even if well-intentioned, on such topics is going to fail the test of who can best bring the nation together.\n\nBoth Biden and Sanders will have their top-tier status severely put to the test on race and gender issues if they enter the primary. Biden is still dogged by his handling of the Anita Hill hearings. The conservative Washington Examiner has been digging up Biden\u2019s comments from the mid-1970s criticizing the use of busing to desegregate schools. His more recent nostalgia for bipartisanship and compromise, even with \u201cold-fashioned Democratic segregationists,\u201d makes today\u2019s young leftists apoplectic.\n\nSanders, meanwhile, has periodically betrayed a tin ear on race and gender. He defended his endorsement of an anti-abortion mayoral candidate by admonishing the left, \u201cYou just can't exclude people who disagree with us on one issue.\u201d And he charitably characterized white Floridians who were uncomfortable voting for an African-American gubernatorial candidate as \u201cnot necessarily racist.\u201d His answer for why he missed sexual misconduct by his 2016 campaign staffers\u2014\u201cI was a little busy running around the country\u201d\u2014did not position him to win the #MeToo vote.\n\nIf you think these statements automatically doom Biden and Sanders, you may be underestimating how forgiving the Democratic electorate can be. Consider that 58 percent of African-Americans in Virginia do not think Northam should resign. Even so, Biden and Sanders have not dealt with these issues as presidential candidates in the 2020 race, when scrutiny will exponentially intensify. They may want to spend a little extra time making sure they know exactly what they want to say on these subjects before they announce.\n\nMost of the straight while male fence-sitters come from the pragmatic corners of the Democratic Party, and they may want to position themselves as less susceptible than the early declared candidates to knee-jerk pandering to the left. Polls show that most Democrats are not inclined to put primary candidates through an obstacle course of purity tests, so there is likely room for such a candidate. But trying to seize the pragmatic mantle comes with a risk, especially for the straight white men. Hectoring others about what\u2019s politically realistic could easily get a candidate tagged as a \u201cmansplainer.\u201d Moreover, any attack by a white man against a woman or a minority\u2014be it from the candidate or from his supporters\u2014would be extremely dangerous to wage, especially if those attacks come from the relative right of the party.\n\nOne question that will be particularly tough for any male candidate: Why shouldn\u2019t the next president be a woman? After all, just among the five female members of Congress already in the field, Democratic voters can choose among different ideologies, geographic and demographic backgrounds, and types of experience. With so many qualified choices, shouldn\u2019t the male candidates just get out of the way?\n\nThe hard truth is, there is no good answer to this question. The most obvious response, that the candidate feels he is best person for the job, runs the risk of sounding condescending. Magnanimity toward female candidates is fraught as well. Sen. Cory Booker recently fielded a softer yet still tricky question from MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow: whether he would commit to a female vice presidential nominee. While trying to delicately say he wouldn\u2019t make an iron-clad commitment, he felt the need to insist that he isn\u2019t trying to thwart women from becoming president. \u201cI believe there should be a woman president right now, and I worked very hard to get one,\u201d Booker said. He was referring to Hillary Clinton, of course, but the answer leaves dangling why isn\u2019t he working to elect a woman president \u201cright now.\u201d\n\nCertainly no candidate is going to say on the record what one almost-candidate, Michael Avenatti, said last year\u2014that to have the best chance of beating President Donald Trump, the Democratic nominee \u201cbetter be a white male.\u201d Even implicitly suggesting such a thing would be dangerous, as the straight white man and Southerner John Edwards did in 2008. He defined himself as the \u201cmost electable candidate\u201d because he could \u201cgo to every corner of America,\u201d implying that the African-American candidate, Barack Obama, and the female candidate, Hillary Clinton, could not.\n\nNot only did Edwards\u2019 argument fail to sway voters in the primary, it was proven wrong by Obama in the general election. Ten years later, a slew of women in swing districts defeated Republican men in several House races to help Democrats take control of the House. There may still be skittish and cynical Democratic voters who worry about Trump defeating another woman, but it\u2019s going to be hard to convince most of them that it\u2019s impossible for a woman to beat Trump.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to feel sorry for the straight white male Democrats. Yes, they have challenges to overcome in a Democratic primary. But female and minority candidates still have to face bigotry every day, and they will be pressed to prove how they will overcome such barriers in a campaign against a president who lacks all restraint on the political battlefield. If some of the dozen or so white guys still thinking about running really do feel they are the best person for the job, part of making their case is by showing us how they can unite the party. If they can\u2019t figure out how to do that, then they should stay on the sidelines."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/16/robert-mueller-roger-stone-paul-manafort-225162", "text": "Jack Shafer is Politico\u2019s senior media writer.\n\nWith a light hand, barely pressing his pencil on paper, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III began sketching his case for Trump campaign collusion with the Russians in a Friday court filing related to Roger Stone\u2019s prosecution for lying to Congress.\n\nUntil Friday, Mueller\u2019s team had been coy about directly connecting any Trump campaign associate to a 12-member Russian GRU military intelligence team it indicted in July 2018 for hacking emails from the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. It had secured guilty pleas from such scandal participants as former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump campaign executive Rick Gates, campaign backbencher George Papadopoulos, and others, and convicted campaign director Paul Manafort on an array of financial fraud charges connected to his politicking and lobbying for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the two seemingly parallel investigations never really intersected. Self-described dirty trickster Stone, who worked on the early Trump campaign and remained close to Trump and his aides after departing, wanted the court to say the investigations were separate. He requested a new judge, saying the charges against him had nothing to do with the Russian hackers case, also being prosecuted before Judge Amy Berman Jackson. But the judge tossed Stone\u2019s request, accepting Mueller\u2019s line of argument that Stone directly interacted with the Russians and Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks, the middleman for the hacked emails.\n\nNow that the two investigations are one, what remains to be gleaned is how wide and deep the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to the Russians and WikiLeaks were.\n\nPrevious Mueller filings had noted Stone\u2019s attempts to contact Assange through intermediaries, hoping to learn what sort of politically potent documents he might have. But Stone had steadfastly denied any contact with Russia or WikiLeaks. That\u2019s a lie, Mueller\u2019s new filing says. Citing evidence obtained in \u201cdozens of search warrants on various accounts used to facilitate the transfer of stolen documents for release,\u201d it claims Stone communicated with WikiLeaks \u2014 referred to as \u201cOrganization 1\u201d in the filing \u2014 and Guccifer 2.0, a Russian intelligence alias used to spread the data stolen in the hacks.\n\nWho else did Stone talk to about the WikiLeaks dump? Last month\u2019s Stone indictment had him informing \u201csenior Trump campaign officials\u201d between June and July 2016 that WikiLeaks possessed stolen emails that could damage the Clinton candidacy. Then came WikiLeaks\u2019 first release of Democratic emails on July 22, 2016, followed by the Trump campaign\u2019s request for more.\n\nThis artfully constructed sentence in the Stone indictment has birthed a million speculations that Donald Trump was among the requesters: \u201cA senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton campaign,\u201d the indictment reads. Would anybody be in a position to direct a senior Trump campaign official but Trump himself? Lightly traced but still visible, Mueller has drawn a possible line from Trump to a campaign aide to Stone to WikiLeaks and to the Russians. Inside the White House, Trump must be screaming for an eraser.\n\nIn the Manafort case, Mueller roughed up the convict with explicit language in a sentencing memorandum filed Friday. \u201cManafort acted for more than a decade as if he were above the law, and deprived the federal government and various financial institutions of millions of dollars,\u201d Mueller wrote. \u201cGiven the breadth of Manafort\u2019s criminal activity, the government has not located a comparable case with the unique array of crimes and aggravating factors.\u201d Under federal sentencing guidelines, Manafort could get 19 to 24\u00bd years in prison\u2014essentially a life sentence for the 69-year-old.\n\nMueller looked like a merciful, New Testament-toting Christian in comparison to Judge Jackson in the Manafort matter. Her Feb. 13 hearing, in which she examined the special counsel\u2019s charge that Manafort had lied after promising cooperation, was released in redacted form Friday. The judge rejected Manafort\u2019s attorneys\u2019 assertion that confusion and not lies were behind the stream of bogus information Manafort had fed Mueller. \u201cMy concern isn\u2019t with nonanswers or simply denials, but the times he affirmatively advanced a detailed alternative story that was inconsistent with the facts.\u201d The lies followed a pattern, too, the judge said. \u201cConcessions comes [sic] in dribs and drabs, only after it\u2019s clear that the office of the special counsel already knew the answer. Again, it\u2019s part of a pattern of requiring the office of the special counsel to pull teeth; withholding facts if he can get away with it.\u201d\n\nThe judge singled out the way Manafort had lied about his interactions with Konstantin V. Kilimnik, Manafort\u2019s former employee and believed by Mueller to be a Russian intelligence asset, calling it a \u201cproblematic attempt to shield his Russian conspirator from liability and it gives rise to legitimate questions about where his loyalties lie.\u201d\n\nManafort originally claimed to have spoken only once with Kilimnik about the Ukrainian \u201cpeace plan\u201d\u2014at the Grand Havana Room cigar joint in New York on Aug. 2, 2016, just before he was fired from the Trump campaign. But Manafort eventually conceded that he discussed the \u201cpeace plan\u201d three additional times after prosecutors showed him evidence of the other meetings. Why these lies? What was he hiding?\n\nThe Kilimnik question engaged and enraged Jackson. \u201cWe\u2019ve now spent considerable time talking about multiple clusters of false or misleading or incomplete or needed-to-be-prodded-by-counsel statements, all of which center around the defendant\u2019s relationship or communications with Mr. Kilimnik,\u201d she said. \u201cThis topic is at the undisputed core of the office of special counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nWith Democrats now calling the investigative shots in the House of Representatives, House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings made news on Friday by sending a letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone claiming evidence that two Trump attorneys had lied to government ethics officials about Cohen\u2019s hush-money payments to women alleging affairs with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThis raises significant questions about why some of the president\u2019s closest advisers made these false claims and the extent to which they too were acting at the direction of, or in coordination with, the president,\u201d Cummings wrote. Trump\u2019s attorneys had denied that Trump owed money to Cohen in 2016 and 2017, but the story evolved after Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said in a TV interview that Trump had paid Cohen as part of a \u201cretainer.\u201d\n\nAfter we sort out the whole Russian mess, the task will be assigned to someone to tally up the saga\u2019s greatest lies. One contender for the crown might be White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who told CNN on Friday that she was interviewed by Mueller\u2019s team late last year. Because Sanders has been loquacious on the investigation topic since taking the press secretary job in July 2017, Mueller would want to know what sort of input Trump provided. Did he feed her the sort of lies that could be read as obstruction to justice?\n\nI hope for Sanders\u2019 sake she told the truth. Jackson and Mueller don\u2019t cotton to liars.\n\n******\n\nIs Judge Jackson a hanging judge? Send predictions via email to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

Carney is commentary editor at the Washington Examiner and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He is the author of Alienated America: Why Some Places Thrive While Others Collapse, from which this is adapted.\n\n\u201cSadly, the American dream is dead.\u201d\n\nAfter rambling, off script, for most of his 50-minute speech to announce his presidential candidacy in June 2015, Donald Trump returned to his written remarks for the final section. He delivered these somber words slowly, pausing for emphasis.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSadly ... the American dream is dead,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the cavernous lobby of Trump Tower, an eager supporter filled that pregnant silence. \u201cBring it back!\u201d\n\nSure enough, that was Trump\u2019s promise and the final line, the bottom line, of his candidacy: \u201cBut if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again!\u201d\n\nThis became his mantra. \"Make America Great Again.\" The premise of that motto\u2014the American dream is dead\u2014carried the day in state after state, and it drew boisterous crowds at rallies in places like Lowell, Mass.; Beaumont, Texas; Mobile, Ala.\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re running on fumes. There\u2019s nothing here.\"\u2014and Springfield, Ill.\n\n\u201cThese rally towns,\u201d the Washington Post reported in an early effort to decode Trump\u2019s meaning, \u201clag behind the country and their home states on a number of measures. Their median household incomes are lower, and they often have lower rates of homeownership or residents with college degrees.\u201d\n\nOn April 26, 2016, my own state of Maryland, along with four other states, voted for Trump in the primary election, putting him on the doorstep of the Republican nomination. \u201cEvery single place I go is a disaster,\u201d Trump said in his victory remarks that night.\n\nTrump obviously didn\u2019t go where I had gone on a reporting trip that morning: to Chevy Chase Village Hall, off of Connecticut Avenue, just outside Washington, D.C. Chevy Chase, Md., is a Democratic stronghold, but a place that liked Trump in the general election in 2016 far less than it did Mitt Romney in 2012. Trump also got only 16 percent of Republican primary votes in Chevy Chase; 64 percent of primary Republican voters preferred then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\nChevy Chase\u2019s rejection of Trump in the primary election could be chalked up as liberal Beltway Republicans rejecting Trump. But if we look deeper, we see parallels to Trump\u2019s performance in some very conservative places in Middle America, and the conditions that might have led to both of those places\u2019 rejections of him.\n\nIn the case of Chevy Chase, the key to understanding Trump opposition in the primary has a lot to do with understanding the strength of the community, just as it does in a Wisconsin town called Oostburg. Oostburg is different from Chevy Chase in almost every way except for one crucial similarity: Both of these villages are knit together by the kind of community institutions and civil society that have disintegrated in most of the United States in the past several decades. These places illustrate a kind of social cohesion that undermines what Trump says about the direction of the American dream. And so the stories of Chevy Chase and Oostburg, two places that rejected Trump, help us to understand why so many other places in the United States embraced him and why they might do so again in 2020.\n\nWhen I arrived at Chevy Chase\u2019s Village Hall, which is the polling place for the village, I found a parking spot between a BMW and a Porsche SUV. That was unsurprising. Chevy Chase Village is the wealthiest municipality in the D.C. region, which is probably the highest-income region in the country. The mean household income in the Village of Chevy Chase is $420,000. Only about 2 percent of America makes that much. Chris Matthews and George F. Will are just two of the well-known residents of the village. Ambassadors, lawyers, bankers and lobbyists populate the beautiful massive homes off Connecticut Avenue, almost all of which are worth more than $1 million. The median home costs $1.52 million.\n\nChevy Chase Village isn\u2019t merely wealthy in material things. To the extent we can measure the good life, Chevy Chase has it. About 95 percent of Chevy Chase\u2019s families had two parents at home in 2015. The Village Hall hosts a monthly speaker series, which kicked off in April 2017 with a talk by documentary filmmaker Tamara Gold. CIA veteran David Duberman was slated for the next month. A committee of volunteers throws regular parties for the whole village. Saint Patrick\u2019s Day included a \u201cFather/Daughter Pipe/Harpist Team and True Scottish Piper,\u201d according to the Crier, the village\u2019s own newsletter. Children and toddlers can take ballet and musical theater classes at Village Hall. Adults can take tai chi.\n\nThe community is engaged. At a village meeting I observed, there were presentations by the volunteer members or chairmen and chairwomen of the Community Relations Committee, the Ethics Commission, the Financial Review Committee, the Public Safety Committee, the Traffic Committee, the Local Advisory Panel to the Historic Preservation Commission, the Western Grove Park Friends Group, the Environment and Energy Committee and the Parks and Greenspaces Committee.\n\nChevy Chase is \u201cthe village\u201d Hillary Clinton said it took to raise a family. And Clinton took the village. The day I was there for the 2016 primary, Clinton raked in 85 percent of the vote. She would a few months later also dominate the general election at this polling place, beating Trump by 56 points. This tells us something rather obvious to anyone who knows the area: that wealthy, white Chevy Chase is very liberal.\n\nBut a closer look tells us something more specific. Compare Clinton\u2019s 56-point margin with 2012, when President Barack Obama defeated Romney by 31 points. There is something about Chevy Chase that makes it like Trump so much less than it liked Romney. Chevy Chase\u2019s aversion to Trump appears much more clearly when we set aside the general election, which is a choice between a Republican and a Democrat. We need to focus instead on the Republican primary, where Trump got a fraction of Kasich\u2019s vote share.\n\nChevy Chase\u2019s wealth is extreme, but the phenomenon in play here\u2014wealthy, highly educated people in affluent communities eschewing Trump and his proclamation that the American dream is dead\u2014is common. Chevy Chase is in Montgomery County, Md., which is the third-most-educated county in the nation, measured by advanced degrees\u201431.6 percent of adults older than 25 have a graduate or professional degree. Nationally, the rate is less than 12 percent. The rest of the top four\u2014Arlington and Alexandria counties in Virginia, and the District of Columbia (functionally a county for our purposes)\u2014are among Trump\u2019s 35 worst counties in America. You can spot the suburbs, chock-full of advanced degrees and six-figure salaries, by looking at a primary election map for counties that voted for Kasich or Marco Rubio.\n\nThe best explanation of why these pockets of elites rejected Trump is found in Trump\u2019s own words. He was selling a sense of decline and a desperate need to turn things around. In Kasich Country, though\u2014in college towns and prosperous suburbs\u2014people believed the American dream was alive. These people also believed America was great already, while much of the electorate didn\u2019t.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a universal rule, and it doesn\u2019t apply as well to the general election, in which voters picked between Trump and Clinton. But, as a general rule, you can use Trump\u2019s electoral strength in the early Republican primaries as a proxy for pessimism. Trump Country, by this definition, is the place where hope is low and where the good life appears out of reach. So the flip side is this: Where Trump bombed\u2014especially in the GOP primaries, but also compared with Romney in 2012\u2014are the places where you can sniff out confidence, optimism, hope and, if you\u2019ll pardon the treacle, the American dream.\n\nIf we start our search for the American dream in Clinton\u2019s Village, the Village of Chevy Chase, it\u2019s tempting to come to a materialistic conclusion: People with money have hope, and the American dream is alive and well in wealthy neighborhoods.\n\nBut a closer look at the primary map reveals other pockets of Trump opposition in the early days\u2014another model of the good life. There\u2019s a different sort of village out there.\n\nThere\u2019s Oostburg.\n\nOostburg couldn\u2019t be more different from Chevy Chase. While Chevy Chase borders the District of Columbia, the village of Oostburg sprouted up in the farm fields of Wisconsin. It\u2019s an outlying suburb of Sheboygan, Wis.\u2014which is not a booming metropolis.\n\nThe median home in Oostburg is worth $148,000, meaning you could buy 10 homes in Oostburg for the price of one in Chevy Chase. Oostburg is not poor: The average household earns $58,000, which is slightly above the national average. Even that slight advantage in household income has a clear\u2014and salient\u2014demographic explanation: Oostburg is a family town.\n\nDifferent types of households nationwide have very different median incomes. Married-family households on average have higher incomes than nonmarried or nonfamily households. Oostburg is much denser with married-family households than the rest of the country\u2014two-thirds of households in Oostburg; less than 50 percent nationwide\u2014and that difference explains Oostburg\u2019s advantage over the national median. In other words, Oostburg\u2019s wealth is literally its family strength.\n\nAnd if you ask Oostburgers, they\u2019ll say their family strength is community strength. A few weeks before that Maryland primary, I spent a couple of days in Oostburg to cover the Wisconsin primaries. Just as I would visit Chevy Chase because of what made it stand out\u2014its wealth\u2014I picked Oostburg because of what made it stand out: its Dutchness and the strong community that the Dutch are known for, even centuries after they immigrated to the United States.\n\nForty-five percent of Oostburg claims Dutch heritage according to the census. Another 42 percent are German. \u201cOostburg\u201d is Dutch for East town. Dutch settlers arrived there in the 1840s, and the signs of the Netherlands, like tulips and miniature windmills, are everywhere. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t Dutch, you ain\u2019t much,\u201d was a phrase I first heard at the lunch counter of Judi\u2019s Place, a family-owned diner.\n\nOn Sunday morning at Judi\u2019s, I saw the truest manifestation of the town\u2019s Dutch heritage, and it wasn\u2019t the diner cuisine: Dozens of families streamed in to eat with their neighbors after service at one of the four Reformed churches in the village. While there\u2019s no speaker series highlighting famous residents, the community\u2019s strength is unquestionable. Neighbors all greet each other at Judi\u2019s. Customers prepared and delivered frozen meals to the waitress, who was scheduled to have surgery the next day.\n\nOne man\u2014a mechanic named Dan\u2014complained to me about a recent Christmas concert at the public school. He couldn\u2019t get a seat in the gym for the concert because all of his neighbors, even those with no school-age children, were there. One neighbor shrugged at Dan\u2019s plight. \u201cWe gotta come see our kids,\u201d the neighbor said. The neighbor had no children singing that day, but Oostburgers consider the kids of Oostburg \u201cour kids.\u201d It takes a village, and Oostburg fits the bill of that village.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s type of village politically. Trump won it 80 percentage points to her 13 points in the general election. In 2014, one blogger suggested Oostburg was the most conservative town in Wisconsin. But just as in Chevy Chase, Oostburg\u2019s Republicans had no use for Trump in the primary election. Trump, who dominated most of Wisconsin\u2019s rural areas, scored only 15 percentage points in the Republican primary in this village. That\u2019s a familiar number\u2014it\u2019s only one point off from his total in Chevy Chase.\n\nWhat made Oostburg so immune to Trump\u2019s appeal? It\u2019s inadequate to say Christian conservatives rejected this twice-divorced New York playboy who had supported abortion rights until recently. In South Carolina, a few weeks earlier, Trump won the evangelical vote with the same amount, 33 percent, that he won the rest of the state, according to exit polls.\n\nOostburg wasn\u2019t an outlier, either. If you wanted to predict which rural, Christian counties would buck the Trump train when they had a choice among Republicans like Ted Cruz, Rubio and Kasich, you could have done a lot worse than looking at a county\u2019s Dutch population.\n\nHere\u2019s the common thread between the Oostburgs and the Chevy Chases and among analogues around the country: Both villages have strong institutions of civil society\u2014local governments, churches, country clubs, garden clubs, good public schools and, in Oostburg\u2019s case, Judi\u2019s Place.\n\nThose community institutions constitute the infrastructure that is necessary to support families.\n\nAnd the institutions in turn are supported by families. Strong families are the precondition for the good life and mobility\u2014the dream, grounded in realistic hope, that no matter your starting point, you can succeed and your children can do even better.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhen data show that the white working class was Trump\u2019s base, it\u2019s easy to see the phrase \u201cwhite working class\u201d as a statement of race and income. It\u2019s more important, though, as a description of a social class\u2014even a way of life. \u201cWhite working-class Americans of all ages,\u201d writes Emma Green in the Atlantic, citing research by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Atlantic, \u201cwere much less likely than their college-educated peers to participate in sports teams, book clubs, or neighborhood associations\u201455 percent vs. 31 percent said they seldom or never participated in those kinds of activities.\u201d\n\nThis had political salience. That poll, taken in midprimaries, when Cruz was the last viable challenger, found Trump leading among GOP voters 37 to 31. But among GOP voters who were \u201ccivically disengaged,\u201d Trump led 50 to 24. Oostburg voted Cruz and Chevy Chase voted Kasich. Within the context of Republicans, churchgoing white Christians are conservative while the wealthy, highly educated white suburbanites are moderates.\n\nYou could see these two things as opposites, but the stories of Kasich Country and Cruz Country are the same story: People enmeshed in strong communities rejected Trump in the early primaries while people alienated, abandoned, lacking social ties and community rushed to him.\n\nTrump\u2019s best large county in the Iowa caucuses, Pottawattamie, had the weakest civil society\u2014churches, neighborhood groups, volunteering, voting\u2014of any large county in Iowa and is known for its neon-lighted casinos erected to bring in out-of-state gamblers. His best small county is notable mostly for church closures and the shuttering of its largest employer in early 2016. It also ranks at the bottom of the state in widely used measures of civil society.\n\nHis other best places in those early primaries\u2014places like Buchanan County, Va.; and Fayette County, Pa.\u2014looked similarly vacant.\n\nWhy do so many people believe the American dream is dead? I think the answer is this: Because strong communities have crumbled and much of America has been abandoned without the web of human connections and institutions that make the good life possible. More of America is a wasteland of alienation. Less of America is the \u201cvillage.\u201d\n\nCan this change?\n\nAmerica has more Chevy Chases today than it did a generation ago, but that\u2019s because wealthy people are clustering more. Making more Chevy Chases is a zero-sum game: It means drawing the skilled, the active, the educated, the leaders out of other communities and concentrating them in places where normal folk can\u2019t afford a house. There is also a clear limit on how many pockets of elites America can have, because, by definition, the elites are few.\n\nBut remember the second village, Oostburg. The raw material is more renewable there, and arguably it used to be more plentiful and could be again. It\u2019s a sense of duty to one\u2019s neighbors\u2014a duty that includes a sense of duty to one\u2019s family. It\u2019s a sense of both being looked after and being needed. It\u2019s a sense of a common, higher purpose. It\u2019s shared, resilient mediating institutions. And frankly, in America at least, that common purpose is a common faith, and those mediating institutions are really the church. There could be more Oostburgs, too.\n\nFrom the forthcoming book ALIENATED AMERICA: Why Some Places Thrive While Others Collapse by Timothy P. Carney. Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Timothy P. Carney.

It was clearly a loss. He still called it a win.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s done the job that we\u2019ve done on the border,\u201d Trump said in the midst of his meandering Rose Garden remarks. \u201cNo matter the money, we\u2019re getting it done. Whether it\u2019s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1 1/2 billion, it\u2019s going to build a lot of wall. We\u2019re getting it done.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump declaring a national emergency on the Mexican border: a first. Trump painting over inconvenient facts: not at all a first. His whole life, from courtrooms and boardrooms in New York to the suites and the jangling halls of his casinos in New Jersey to his unlikely political ascent and now his two-plus haywire years in the White House, Trump unceasingly has suffered setbacks but nonetheless dubbed them successes. There are people, of course, who see him as little more than a scattershot incompetent, but to settle for that characterization is to miss this vital part of his M.O. It\u2019s one of his most uncommon and undeniable talents\u2014a stubborn and often effective refusal to allow others to define his victories and defeats.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/2500/1155968404_6002673636001_6002674931001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe current situation, though, could be his most challenging rebranding effort yet. The wall, after all, was the evocative underpinning of his candidacy, chant-ready chum, an unsubtle cross between a policy position and a race-laced call to arms. As a piece of pure imagery, it\u2019s been surpassed perhaps only by the red MAGA hat. But his \u201cgreat, great,\u201d \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d remains Trump\u2019s political lifeblood. It either will or won\u2019t exist, and that could determine his political future.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s in big trouble if he can\u2019t build it,\u201d former campaign aide Sam Nunberg, who says he\u2019s the one who had the idea of the wall as a winning issue for Trump, told me. \u201cIf he\u2019s not getting anything done, I think it\u2019s terrible for his re-elect.\u201d\n\nAnd with the 2020 presidential campaign ramping up with a growing register of Democrats vying for the right to attempt to take down Trump, all while special counsel Robert Mueller and emboldened foes in Congress intensity their investigations into him, his family, his associates, his businesses and his administration, he\u2019s staring at an unprecedented challenge. Even with his Twitter-torqued bully pulpit, Trump has never had less capacity to singlehandedly control a storyline. There simply are too many people with too much power of their own who stand ready and eager to hold him to account for any perceived failure. Polls and pundits\u2014most painfully fellow Republicans\u2014provide feedback openly complicating his self-serving narrative.\n\nThis swirling battlefront underscores the chasm between a deal cut in the business world, in which Trump could steamroll the post-handshake fanfare, and a compromise struck at the highest-profile, highest-stakes, uppermost echelon of politics. Whether Trump in this case, too, can convince a consequential percentage of the electorate he\u2019s the one who won here remains to be seen. But people who know him well are certain he will try.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll take it and say that he engineered it and that he saved the country,\u201d former Trump Organization executive Barbara Res said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to find a way to save face,\u201d former Trump casino executive Jack O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to quit on this one, I don\u2019t think, because the embarrassment is just too great for him right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that he will find ways of casting this as a partial victory to be completed,\u201d said Steve Robinson, an architect who was one of the many residents of Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side who worked for years in the 1980s and \u201890s to prevent Trump from building the gargantuan, skyline-altering Trump City project that was to be the developer\u2019s career-defining accomplishment. Robinson has written a forthcoming book about it titled Turf War.\n\nThe tale of Trump City actually might be the chapter in Trump\u2019s past that\u2019s most useful to mull while watching the unfolding wall fight. Because his antagonists were materially successful, limiting him to smaller, shorter buildings, no phallic centerpiece and a park on the bank of the Hudson River. So, too, though, in the end, in his own inimitable fashion, was Trump, who ultimately emerged hundreds of millions of dollars richer than he would have been without the transaction as a whole. \u201cHe\u2019s very skilled,\u201d Robinson granted, \u201cat taking a loss, taking a hit, and using his public relations and branding skill to call it a win. And I think that is pervasive in terms of his behavior.\u201d\n\nThe track record reaches back almost half a century.\n\nIn the \u201870s, after settling a federal lawsuit that alleged racist rental practices in the outer-borough apartments he and his father owned and ran, the Department of Justice described the agreement as \u201cone of the most far-reaching ever negotiated.\u201d The headline in the New York Amsterdam News, the city\u2019s black newspaper: \u201cMinorities win housing suit.\u201d Trump said it was a win, too\u2014for him. \u201cThis,\u201d he told the Daily News, \u201cis a landmark settlement, in that it upholds the right of real estate owners who abide by the provisions of the Fair Housing Act from being harassed for alleged discrimination without supporting facts or documentation.\u201d With aid and encouragement from Roy Cohn, he then dawdled on compliance with such temerity and for so many years he was able to sidestep the more punitive effects of the decree. \u201cIt just kind of petered out,\u201d a DOJ attorney who worked on the case told me.\n\nIn the \u201880s, as the owner of the New Jersey Generals of the second-rate United States Football League, he spearheaded a brazen antitrust effort against the National Football League. It failed. It was immediately clear the defeat in court was a kill shot for the entire league\u2014and a colossal loss for Trump. \u201cWe won a great moral victory,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe expect to win a total victory.\u201d A judge in an appeals court not only upheld the ruling but mostly blamed Trump. \u201cSuicide,\u201d he said. Trump blamed the league. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a Trump thing,\u201d he would say decades later.\n\nThe list goes on. His Trump Shuttle lasted for less than three years and ended up almost a quarter of a billion dollars in debt. \u201cI ran it really well,\u201d he said. His first marriage exploded because of his adultery, and he simultaneously teetered on the precipice of financial ruin, and yet he turned the tawdry tabloid headlines of early 1990 into oxygen to stoke his celebrity. He marveled and reveled. \u201cSome story,\u201d he said. A litany of his ventures (Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka, Trump Mortgage, Trump University \u2026) have been failures in every respect but the spreading of his name. His casinos filed for bankruptcy five times. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a failure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a success.\u201d\n\nAnd on the Upper West Side, on 76 acres of old rail yards, the most important, illustrative plot of land in his life this side of 725 Fifth and 1600 Pennsylvania avenues, Trump unveiled a series of dramatic models, drawings and renderings of his objectives\u2014staggering banks of towers, all flanking the cynosure of the world\u2019s tallest building. Robinson and legions of others said no. Trump stood pat. He\u2019d wait them out, he assured. Ultimately, though, weakened by his adversaries\u2019 organized, well-funded resistance as well as his own outbursts, missteps and economic distress, Trump dropped his long-held stance of intransigence, essentially rolled over in negotiations and then enlisted significant help from investors in Hong Kong to build finally a shrunken version of what he initially had envisioned. But what was there was enough for him to point at and crow. A \u201ctriumph,\u201d he called it in his 1997 book, The Art of the Comeback.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been able to create his own reality,\u201d late Trump biographer Wayne Barrett told me three years ago.\n\n\u201cHe knows of no other way, and that is to spin until he\u2019s woven some gossamer fabric out of garbage,\u201d gossip columnist George Rush told me two years ago.\n\nA onetime congregant and lifetime devotee of the seminal self-help pastor Norman Vincent Peale, Trump has spent decades, according to biographer Gwenda Blair, working to \u201cweaponize\u201d Peale\u2019s \u201cpower of positive thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI win, I win, I always win,\u201d he said in 2005.\n\nAnd when he doesn\u2019t? \u201cI do whine, because I want to win,\u201d he said on CNN in August 2015, \u201cand I\u2019m not happy about not winning, and I am a whiner, and I keep whining and whining until I win.\u201d\n\nAs a candidate, he promised \u201cso much winning\u201d the country would \u201cget bored with winning.\u201d As president, no matter what, he repeatedly has given himself A-plus grades. Last fall, when he called his administration historically effective in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the world\u2019s most powerful people laughed. Ever unshamed and undaunted, at rally after rally after rally heading into the midterms, he declared success and guaranteed more. \u201cWe\u2019re winning,\u201d he said in Indiana. \u201cWe\u2019re winning so much,\u201d he said in Montana. \u201cWe are going to win, win, win,\u201d he said in Missouri. These confident proclamations, of course, were followed by considerable losses. The results of the elections on November 6 changed plenty about how Washington worked. They changed little about how Trump talked.\n\nThis week, as another shutdown loomed, Trump vented to reporters about the developing deal. \u201cI\u2019m adding things to it, and when you add the things I have to add,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s all going to happen where we\u2019ll build a beautiful, big, strong wall that\u2019s not going to let criminals and traffickers and drug dealers and drugs into our country. It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s very simple.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been. He stewed on Twitter: \u201cwill be hooked up with lots of money from other sources,\u201d \u201calmost $23 BILLION for Border Security,\u201d \u201cthe Wall is being built.\u201d\n\nIn his speech in El Paso, Texas, on Monday, he emphasized a change in his signature pledge, a telling tweak he\u2019d been floating for months. Old: \u201cBuild that wall.\u201d New: \u201cFinish that wall.\u201d It\u2019s a forward-looking slogan in which nebulous progress can be cast as a promise kept. \u201cThe wall is very, very on its way,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nA complete wall is not a requisite for success, in Nunberg\u2019s estimation. \u201cIf he moves around, he gets this money, he makes the effort, and they start actually building \u2026 he\u2019s going to have a real visual,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, though, there\u2019s no visual\u2014only the president\u2019s version of reality.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll just continue this theme through 2020,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said, \u201cand if he gets re-elected, he\u2019ll keep pounding this for the next six years.\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of things he says are manifestly untrue,\u201d Res said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he just keep going on saying he\u2019s building the wall with other money?\u201d\n\nRobinson from the Upper West Side has seen it all before.\n\n\u201cHe will undoubtedly continue to lie about it and claim some sort of victory,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can build 200 yards of wall and say he built the wall. And the press, which has been so diligent in fact-checking, will say, \u2018No, no, no, wait a second, Mr. President. You didn\u2019t build the wall that you said you were going to build. You only built 200 yards of it.\u2019 And it won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/15/congress-house-democrats-freshmen-mikie-sherrill-aoc-225054", "text": "Michael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico.\n\nMikie Sherrill had made a promise to the people in New Jersey who had made her a member of Congress. She would try to fire her boss on her first day at work. Now here she was. Would she? Could she? At 1:36 in the afternoon, in her opening salvo on the floor of the House of Representatives, she did\u2014casting her vote for speaker not for Nancy Pelosi, arguably the most powerful woman in the history of American politics, but for \u2026 Cheri Bustos, the fourth-term congresswoman from Illinois. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep your promises,\u201d she told reporters on her way out of the chamber.\n\nStill, a few hours later, as the sun started to set on Washington, after Sherrill dashed across a traffic-clogged Constitution Avenue from a cab to the Capitol in bright red high heels, I asked her if she was afraid of having crossed Pelosi. Of retribution in the form of committee snubs. Of being rendered somehow less effective before she\u2019d even gotten started.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\nSherrill, a 47-year-old Navy veteran, is fit, with an easy, ready smile and sandy blond hair that she usually wears down. She had on a gray dress with flecks of color that more or less matched those non-shy shoes. And here, one half of one day into her time in Congress, she elaborated with a brief, bold assertion of the source of her power.\n\n\u201cShe just got the majority, OK?\u201d Sherrill said, referring to Pelosi. \u201cAnd we did it with districts like mine. And we\u2019re going to hold it through districts like mine.\u201d\n\nNo\u2014she was not afraid.\n\nAnd she was right. Even as Pelosi punished some others who had spurned her, she would put Sherrill on the House Armed Services Committee\u2014Sherrill\u2019s top choice\u2014and make her a chair of the science, space and technology subcommittee. In the wake of her unaccommodating, unruffled vote, Sherrill had emerged unscathed.\n\nThe best-known new member of Congress is obviously the ubiquitous and magnetic Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the unreserved used-to-be bartender and millennial social media savant who has parlayed her outer-borough seat into a vanguard position at the head of a surging left. But she is not the reason Democrats are wielding a reclaimed wedge of power in the nation\u2019s capital. Sherrill is. If there\u2019s a Venn diagram of how Democrats wrested control of the House from Republicans \u2014women, veterans, flipped districts in more affluent, more educated suburban terrain\u2014smack at the center is Rebecca Michelle Sherrill: former Navy helicopter pilot, former federal prosecutor, mother of four (13, 11, 9 and 6). And even as Ocasio-Cortez and other younger, lefty, louder freshmen garner the limelight, \u201cMikie,\u201d not \u201cAOC,\u201d is actually more materially the face of the Democrats\u2019 fresh capacity to push legislation and check the agenda of a newly vexed President Donald Trump.\n\nCongresswoman-elect Mikie Sherrill holds her daughter Marit's hand as she walks to the U.S. Capitol to be sworn in on Jan. 3, 2019. | Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine\n\nEver since November\u2019s tectonic midterms, in my conversations with party strategists as well as nonpartisan operatives involved in the variety of efforts to get more veterans elected, Sherrill\u2019s name not only kept coming up but typically was the first one mentioned. \u201cSo impressive,\u201d Rye Barcott of With Honor told me. \u201cNo ceiling,\u201d said Emily Cherniack of New Politics. \u201cA rising star,\u201d added Carrie Rankin, the former chief of staff to Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton. Dan Sena, the former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told me Sherrill could be a governor, or a senator, and soon. \u201cShe\u2019s a future fill-in-the-blank for the party,\u201d Sena said. Republicans I\u2019ve talked to concur.\n\nThe root of this big talk is the nature of her victory. She won as a first-time candidate in New Jersey\u2019s 11th Congressional District, which stretches from commuter enclaves just west of New York City toward the more bucolic northwestern portion of the state\u2014and hadn\u2019t voted for a Democrat in 34 years. She raised record money, chased into retirement a powerful local political scion, trounced a host of opponents in the primary and drubbed a conservative state assemblyman in the general. Sherrill did this by campaigning not as a left-leaning incendiary but as a less partisan alternative. And one of the most conspicuous ways she assuaged redder voters was by promising she wouldn\u2019t vote for Pelosi for speaker. It was by no means the foundation of her race; neither, though, was it a pledge those who disdain the longtime Democrat leader would be likely to forget.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

There was not, she told me, \u201ca completely safe way to keep the promise.\u201d In picking Bustos, she explained, Sherrill recognized her as a woman who has found a way to win in a district that backed Trump\u2014an ascendant member of the caucus who could be the speaker. When I asked Pelosi about Sherrill, the speaker responded with a gracious if flowery statement that amounted to no hard feelings: \u201cThis election proved that nothing is more wholesome to our democracy than the increased participation and leadership of women. As a Navy veteran, former Assistant U.S. Attorney and a mother, Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill reflects the beauty, diversity and dynamism of her district and our country.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s 11th is a mostly staid tangle of subdivisions, interstates and office parks, so Pelosi\u2019s reference to the \u201cdynamism\u201d of Sherrill\u2019s district is a nod not to some edgy vibe but rather its electoral volatility. Everywhere, and every cycle, is different, with myriad factors tipping the scales, of course, but one axiom is that a member of Congress is especially vulnerable in his or her first reelection campaign, before a combination of familiarity, incumbency and inertia set in. Ocasio-Cortez elicits conservative ridicule for her colossally ambitious Green New Deal; assuming, though, she doesn\u2019t get sideswiped by redistricting, the reality is she\u2019s in a much safer spot than Sherrill. And it\u2019s Pelosi who will have the most say about whose respective agenda will get the green light\u2014progressive or centrist\u2014and when. Factored in those decisions: the fact that Sherrill is the one who needs greater shelter and leeway. Which of these women, then, will exert more influence over the shape of the party over these next crucial couple of years and beyond? Because while AOC\u2019s New York City district isn\u2019t going Republican in the foreseeable future, Pelosi knows Sherrill\u2019s in North Jersey is a different matter. It\u2019s worth keeping her happy, and Sherrill in turn needs to keep her red-tinged electorate happy, all while defending against potential attacks from within her own caucus.\n\nOn her first day in office, Rep. Sherrill rides an escalator in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on her way to meet New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy (top), poses with her husband Jason and Speaker Nancy Pelosi for a mock swearing-in (bottom left) and takes a family photo at the Capitol (bottom right). | Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine\n\nWhen Sherrill was in the Navy, she had to pass a test underwater in which she was blindfolded, turned upside down in a replica helicopter and forced to find her way out. She had to endure prisoner of war training that involved being waterboarded and punched. \u201cAfter you\u2019re a Navy helicopter pilot,\u201d the DCCC\u2019s Sena posited, \u201ceverything else is easy.\u201d Perhaps. A month-plus into the 116th Congress, though, the task for Sherrill\u2014and the several dozen other Democratic members like her\u2014inevitably gets harder from here. It\u2019s one thing to tout a r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2014it\u2019s another to defend a record. Votes are choices, and choices have consequences, and she will have to toggle between serving the interests of those to her left who fueled her bid and those to her right who are equally if not even more responsible for her win. How will she vote on issues like defense spending and the use of force? Security on the Mexican border? What about \u201cMedicare for All\u201d? The prospect of impeachment? AOC\u2019s Green New Deal?\n\nBut back in the Capitol, on the evening of that first day, Sherrill along with her husband approached Pelosi for her ceremonial swearing-in. \u201cCongratulations to you,\u201d said a smiling Sherrill, shaking her hand. Pelosi asked after the kids. Sherrill said they had gone back to swim in the pool at their apartment. \u201cSay no more,\u201d Pelosi said. Pleasantries completed, Sherrill put her hand on a copy of the Constitution. She raised her hand. Pelosi raised hers. They smiled for the cameras, rolling, clicking, flashing. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d Sherrill said to Pelosi with another quick pump of a handshake. \u201cThank you. Thanks again.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nTrump was the trigger. Sherrill was alarmed by his election and the outset of his administration, \u201cappalled,\u201d she said. She was irritated, too, by Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen\u2019s refusal to hold town halls, which she considered a baseline of responsible representation. A friend suggested to Sherrill\u2014who had left the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Newark in October 2016 and was looking to work in criminal justice reform\u2014that she should run for his seat. Crazy, she thought at first. But the more she considered it, \u201cthe more I felt this real responsibility to do it,\u201d she told me. She announced her candidacy in May of 2017.\n\nEven then, a year and a half away from Election Day, before the driving themes of the 2018 cycle\u2014of women, of veterans, of the primacy of smarter, richer suburbs\u2014had come into full, vivid focus, Sherrill seemed tailor-made. She was not only a woman but a mother who helped coach her kids\u2019 soccer and lacrosse teams in the suburbs, not only a veteran but a veteran who had been a pilot of an H-3 Sea King in Europe and the Middle East before becoming a Russia policy officer.

A degree from Georgetown Law. \u201cHer life before this,\u201d Mollie Binotto, her campaign manager, told me recently, \u201creally got her ready.\u201d It produced a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, thought Saily Avelenda, executive director of the grassroots group NJ 11th for Change, that checked every conceivable box. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t make one up that was better for this district,\u201d she said.\n\nFeeding off frustration with Frelinghuysen and the women-led antipathy for the self-styled alpha male in the Oval Office, Sherrill relentlessly rapped the president and worked to yoke Frelinghuysen with Trump\u2019s \u201cchaotic and reckless\u201d administration.\n\nWhen I talked to her in March 2018 for a story about New York candidate Max Rose and other veterans running for Congress, Sherrill made clear that Trump was her main motivation for running. \u201cAfter a lifetime of serving the country,\u201d she said, \u201cto see all of the values that I had spent so much time supporting and protecting, values that I had really sworn to give my life to protect\u2014things like attacks on women and minorities and Gold Star families and POWs and freedom of the press and the Constitution and the list really goes on\u2014I knew I had to act.\u201d\n\nAs for Frelinghuysen? \u201cHe has definitely been rubber-stamping Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cIn lockstep,\u201d she said. \u201cComplicit,\u201d she said.\n\nShe tempered this prosecutorial rhetoric with a stream of disciplined nods to the area\u2019s many moderates. She talked about infrastructure (in particular the importance of funding the Gateway tunnel), taxes (getting back the state and local deductions the Trump tax overhaul had diminished), health care (stressing availability and affordability over an outright scrapping of the Affordable Care Act) and sensible gun control (universal background checks), and she played up her credibility as a veteran who would \u201cput the people of the country first,\u201d rather than hew slavishly to the party line.\n\nHelpfully for Sherrill, the 11th has been trending to the left for a decade. The last round of redistricting pulled in a piece of Montclair, where she lives, a blue bastion from whose hilltops one can gaze across the Hudson at the skyline of Manhattan. In 2008, GOP presidential candidate John McCain won the district by 9 percentage points. In 2012, Romney took it by 5.8. Trump won by less than 1. But he still won. \u201cThis district was not going to go for a liberal socialist,\u201d said Patrick Murray, the top pollster at nearby Monmouth University. \u201cIt\u2019s still conservative in its fiscal values, and she was able to play it right down the middle.\u201d\n\nSherrill graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1994 and flew H-3 Sea King helicopters throughout Europe and the Middle East. She left the Navy in 2003. | Courtesy of the office of Mikie Sherrill\n\nIt worked. At the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, she started racking up endorsements (the Democratic Party chairs from the four counties in the district, clusters of local and regional groups, EMILY\u2019s List, NARAL, Moulton\u2019s Serve America PAC, VoteVets, Joe Biden). Contributions rolled in. So did headlines. \u201cDemocrats gather to back Mikie Sherrill,\u201d said one, which wasn\u2019t so surprising. \u201cLongtime donor to Frelinghuysen backing Democrat,\u201d said another, which was. \u201cPINK WAVE,\u201d predicted ABC News. All of which contributed to the path-clearing late January jolt: \u201cFrelinghuysen won\u2019t seek reelection.\u201d\n\nAs winter turned toward spring, projections had shifted from \u201clikely Republican\u201d to \u201cleaning Republican\u201d to \u201ctoss-up.\u201d The Sherrill campaign was developing \u201cthis sense of inevitability,\u201d as she would put it to me. Still, she needed moderate Republicans to side with her and would have to break with Pelosi to achieve that aim, and she was sufficiently astute to know the head of her party was going to need to be in the loop. Sherrill contacted Pelosi. The first time they talked was April, according to Sherrill, and she told Pelosi, she said, \u201cabout the district and what it looks like.\u201d In May, Sherrill announced publicly she wouldn\u2019t be supporting her for speaker if and when she got elected.\n\nIt had the desired effect.\n\n\u201cWhen she said that, I was, like, \u2018That\u2019s surprising and refreshing,\u2019\u201d said Nicholas Kumburis, a centrist from Parsippany who is the state chair of the fledgling, centrist Alliance Party. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t going to just be a puppet.\u201d\n\nIn the estimation of Michael Soriano, the Democratic mayor of Parsippany, this was \u201cthe smarter way to counter what we saw in 2016\u201d\u2014to not run as, in his words, \u201cthe as-loud and as-bombastic\u201d candidate. She broke from Democratic orthodoxy, too, in areas like defense spending and taxes for large government programs\u2014worried as she was that the brunt could fall disproportionately to her would-be constituents.\n\nFinn Wentworth, a major donor who had contributed to Frelinghuysen in the past, credited this more middle-of-the-road approach for his ground-shifting switch to Sherrill. \u201cFrankly, 20 years ago, she would have been a Kean Republican,\u201d referring to Tom Kean, the former New Jersey governor. \u201cShe was not an extremist for left-wing causes or right-wing causes. \u2026 Put cable news aside. The vast majority of us live in the middle. And that\u2019s where her voice comes from.\u201d\n\nOn Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Rep. Sherrill attends several services throughout her New Jersey district, including at the New Light Baptist Church in Bloomfield (top), the Livingston Community Center in Livingston (bottom left) and New Light Baptist Church in Bloomfield (bottom right). | Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine\n\nIn August, on MSNBC, Moulton pointed to Sherrill as somebody with a winning formula for her district who also could be part of an answer to the intractable partisanship of D.C. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we are a party that embraces a diversity of ideas and is willing to embrace people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2026 and also amazing veterans like Mikie Sherrill \u2026 who is a much more centrist Democrat who can actually win a tough seat and take it back from a Republican, a seat that Alexandria would not be able to win.\u201d\n\nGiven that her opponent was considered one of the most conservative in the State Assembly and had been endorsed in a tweet by Trump, it was perhaps not a surprise that, on November 6, Sherrill won. The surprise was that she won by as much as she did\u2014by nearly 15 percentage points, an eye-popping swing in a district that only two years before had opted for Trump and given Frelinghuysen 58 percent of the vote. Gushed one headline: \u201cWhy Mikie Sherrill might be the best thing to happen to the Democratic Party in years.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nOn a frigid night last month in Montclair, inside a warm diner on the main drag, a man working behind the counter started telling what sounded like an inappropriate joke.\n\n\u201cYou know what helicopter pilots are good for?\u201d he said.\n\nSherrill cringed.\n\n\u201cUhhh \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThey put themselves in the most dangerous places,\u201d the man said, \u201cfor other people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nSitting across from me in a booth, Sherrill emitted a practically audible sigh of relief.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s nice. I have been called an Uber driver\u2014that\u2019s better, thank you\u2014by Marines.\u201d\n\nFor politicians, town halls are dangerous places, too, or can be. They\u2019re unpredictable. Who\u2019s going to stand up and ask what? But they make for illustrative snapshots of districts. And a few days after we talked at the diner, Sherrill held her first town hall, which was a priority given her criticism of Frelinghuysen. Outside the Parsippany Police Athletic League, officers directed cars into overflow lots. Inside, in a big gym with walls covered with banners for championship boxing, wrestling and basketball teams, and ads for insurance companies, labor unions and military recruiters, almost 500 people found seats in plastic folding chairs. Local Girl Scouts led the Pledge of Allegiance. A row of veterans of Korea and Vietnam stood by the rear wall.\n\nSherrill, wearing a blue dress and a black blazer, delivered a bit of a preamble, outlining her committee assignments, telling them about bills she had co-sponsored and explaining why she had joined two centrist groups within her caucus\u2014the New Democrat Coalition and (\u201cmore controversially,\u201d she granted) the Blue Dog Coalition.\n\nTop left: Rep.

The second was about the environment. The third was about taxes. It wasn\u2019t until the last half-hour of a two-hour convening that Sherrill was hit with a question about impeachment. The first question about Medicare for All came even after that. It can be risky to read too much into the order of these questions, but there was a notable lack of anti-Trump bloodlust. There was, however, a detectable concern about Democratic politics writ large.\n\nShe was asked about the \u201crift\u201d in the party.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s by no means clear that a rift won\u2019t be coming,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cI think the fear is what we saw in the Republican Party\u2014people on the Tea Party movement breaking with the party, creating a rift and having some 30-odd members of the Tea Party pretty much control the entire House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nFloating in the air, at least to me, was AOC. Sherrill, it turned out, was thinking it too, so she went there\u2014carefully.\n\n\u201cWhat I have seen in the party is a group of people who come from very different districts,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, you know, there are districts\u2014like Queens, for example, is very different from Morristown.\u201d\n\nKnowing snickers rippled through the crowd.\n\n\u201cThere are people who have different ideas, different agendas,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cBut what can happen with that is people kind of breaking paradigms and raising ideas that maybe we just hadn\u2019t thought about \u2026\u201d\n\nThen she named the name.\n\nReporters, she said, \u201cthey come to me and they\u2019re always, like, \u2018How do you feel about\u201d\u2014and here she kind of crouched down and whisper-hissed in her most snakish, conspiratorial voice\u2014\u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez?\u201d\n\nNow people laughed and hooted and clapped.\n\n\u201cAnd I say,\u201d Sherrill said, \u201c\u2018I think this young woman has gotten a whole generation of people engaged in our democratic process in a way that we haven\u2019t seen\u2014\u201d Cheers drowned out what she even said next\u2014years? \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s exciting. I don\u2019t agree with everything she says. I\u2019m not going to vote on a lot of things she says that she might put before the floor. But I\u2019m more than happy to talk to her about what shaping the future of this country might need to look like and then to look at it and say, \u2018Gosh, we really need to move forward on environmental legislation. Where can we move forward together?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe was asked about cutting defense spending.\n\n\u201cI am not committed to cutting our military expenditures because there are areas where I feel we\u2019re underfunding them, such as satellite technology and cybersecurity,\u201d she said.\n\nThe impeachment question came from the president of a club of Democrats at a local retirement community. \u201cWould you support an effort to impeach President Trump?\u201d\n\nMurmurs. Shifting in seats.\n\nSherrill said she wanted to wait to see the final findings of special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cPeople know that impeaching our president is going against the democratic will of the people. \u2026 So going against the will of the people like that is a huge step to take. I think it undermines our executive branch. It undermines institutions of our democracy. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a step that I would take. It\u2019s simply a step that I would take very carefully.\u201d\n\nThe Medicare for All question came from a young man who asked what he asked with ferocity. \u201cWill you support a Medicare for All bill?\u201d he said, before making the case himself for that system. It elicited what might have been the loudest and most sustained cheering of the afternoon.\n\nSherrill let it die down.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cwith respect to Medicare for All \u2026\u201d It\u2019s not easy, she said. \u201cThere will be winners and losers,\u201d she said. She wants to be sure the high-taxed taxpayers of New Jersey\u2019s 11th aren\u2019t going to be the losers, she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is moving a third of our economy into a different plan,\u201d she said. She advocated a more cautious, more incremental approach.\n\nRep. Sherrill\u2019s red shoes that she wore on the House floor when she made her promised vote for someone other than Nancy Pelosi to be speaker. | Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine\n\nIt was, I thought, an appropriate end to the event. To my eye and ear, every time the crowd started to get riled up, typically by a question from somebody clearly to her left, Sherrill listened, waited for a beat \u2026 and then used her answer to turn down the volume in the room. Mic'd up, she was this bipartisan defuser. It made me have two thoughts. One: It\u2019s a heck of a skill. Two: Is that what people want right now?\n\n\u201cThere are going to be people on the far, far end of the left,\u201d Heather Darling, a Republican Morris County Freeholder, told me, \u201cthat are going to expect to see things, like really big things, that she can\u2019t deliver.\u201d\n\nAt the Parsippany PAL, though, I offered Sherrill my admittedly somewhat cheeky post-town hall assessment. No gotchas or shout-downs. No fireworks or fisticuffs.\n\n\u201cIt was,\u201d I told her, \u201ca little boring.\u201d\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 OK?\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Dan Sena is the executive director of the DCCC.

Robert Moses Did. The most lasting legacy of New York\u2019s power broker is that it\u2019s now impossible to build anything in the city.\n\nMarc J. Dunkelman, a fellow at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, is the author of \u201cThe Vanishing Neighbor: The Transformation of American Community.\u201d\n\nJust like with Amazon\u2019s recent proposal to build a new corporate campus in Queens, local residents opposed Robert Moses\u2019 plans to construct the Cross-Bronx Expressway through the working-class neighborhood of East Tremont in the early 1950s. Determined to save scores of residential buildings by forcing Moses, then New York\u2019s most powerful public figure, to alter the route, members of the East Tremont Neighborhood Association lined up a raft of political support.\n\nAs Robert Caro tells the story, led by a local \u201chousewife\u201d named Lillian Edelstein, activists extracted a promise from the soon-to-be-mayor, Robert F. Wagner, that he would \u201cvote against any resolution\u201d allowing Moses to acquire private property for the roadway. As Caro explains in The Power Broker, up until the night Moses rolled them, Edelstein and her neighbors believed they were going to win. Not long thereafter, Moses\u2019 wrecking crew plowed through.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMore than a half-century later, that narrative has been turned on its head. As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: \u201cAnything is possible: today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors defeated Amazon\u2019s corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world.\u201d\n\nBut as uplifting as that fantasy may be, it ignores a more mundane reality. In all likelihood, Amazon could have worked with the deal\u2019s biggest champions, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, to push past the limited public hostility\u2014most New Yorkers supported Amazon\u2019s plan to bring thousands of new jobs to the region. The difference today is that no amount of leverage is capable of overcoming resistance from a small star chamber in Albany known as the Public Authorities Control Board. Without unanimous support from the three voting members of the PACB, Amazon\u2019s plan was dead in the water.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. Before Gov. Hugh Carey agreed to give the state assembly and senate the power to veto any major public project through the PACB\u2014a deal he made in 1976 in a desperate but successful attempt to keep the New York from dissolving into bankruptcy\u2014generations of men like Moses regularly dictated the terms of every public development. But today, even the combined power of the governor and mayor was unable to face down obstruction from Michael Gianaris, the state senate\u2019s PACB appointment, a man who happened to represent the area where Amazon wanted to locate its new campus. Like Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s 2005 proposal to build an Olympic Stadium on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, this little-known public functionary proved an unbreachable barrier.\n\nAfter roughly 40 years as New York\u2019s master builder, Moses was shown the door by Gov. Nelson Rockefeller in the 1960s. By then, the public was seething and New York seemed to be on the decline. The PACB is one of a raft of new tools established in the wake of Moses\u2019 reign to check the power of government to build new public works and other redevelopment projects.\n\nAmong them: After the enormous, beaux-arts Pennsylvania Station was demolished in 1963 to make way for the sad oversized drum of Madison Square Garden, a movement of preservationists persuaded Mayor Wagner to sign a bill establishing a landmarks commission. To protect the public from wanton abuse of the nation\u2019s natural resources, President Richard Nixon established the environmental review process in 1970. In New York, zoning laws have been modified to provide local residents with a more powerful voice in protecting the character of their neighborhoods. Taken together, the effect has been to give a range of characters throughout the system opportunities to throw sand in the gears whenever anyone tries to build anything.\n\nAt a Moses retrospective organized more than a decade ago, Caro recalled that, all too frequently, people \u201cof the real estate persuasion,\u201d frustrated that red tape prevents too many developments from getting off the ground, would approach him at cocktail parties and ask: \u201cDon't you think it's time for a new Robert Moses?\u201d And Caro, thinking of Lillian Edelstein and the other residents of East Tremont, would say, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nBut even Moses could not work his will on New York City today. As forceful, persuasive, wily and prodigious as he was, Moses would still not have been able to overcome the resistance to the Amazon deal. That\u2019s not because local residents are more forceful today. Like Cuomo, de Blasio and Jeff Bezos, Moses would have lost because he would not have had any leverage on the state senator who sat on the PACB. And that lone state senator had the single-handed power to kill the deal altogether. On this one issue, Gianaris\u2019 \u201cno\u201d was more powerful than every \u201cyes\u201d standing behind the deal.\n\nFor those who see themselves as champions for ordinary people like Edelstein, that shift may be welcome. Moses\u2019 mark often left a scar. But for policymakers\u2014and particularly for progressives whose aim it is to use public power for the public good\u2014the hurdles erected in his wake make the process of doing great things next to impossible. The scar tissue built over the past 50 years to prevent the second coming of Moses stops good projects as well as bad.\n\nWith few exceptions\u2014a slow-moving water tunnel buried deep beneath the city, three extra subway stops on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, an extension of the 7 line, a bevy of new parks\u2014New York has done little more than maintain the public infrastructure it boasted when the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was opened in 1964. That\u2019s not because the Big Apple has lost its imagination\u2014developers, politicians, associations and other throw big ideas around all the time. It\u2019s because power has been pushed down and out, spread so thin that even projects championed by the governor, mayor and the city\u2019s business elite face impossible opposition.\n\nAmazon\u2019s detractors had a range of legitimate concerns, and experts can argue about the merit of this particular deal. But Amazon isn\u2019t packing up because of public resistance to too many tax breaks or a helipad. It\u2019s leaving because, like in much of the country, the architecture of political power has changed. In ways Robert Moses could never have imagined, those with big dreams now suffer interminably from the absence of leverage. Moses\u2019 final legacy is that he made it impossible to get things done."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/mitch-mcconnell-elaine-chao-relationship-1163655", "text": "The records also do not show how frequently Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has met with people from outside Kentucky, a state Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has represented in the Senate since 1985. | Jack Gruber/AFP/Getty Images congress Emails reveal coordination between Chao, McConnell offices Chao has met at least 10 times with politicians and business leaders from the state in response to requests from McConnell\u2019s office.\n\nA trove of more than 800 pages of emails sheds new light on the working relationship between Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, one of the most potent power couples in Washington \u2014 including their dealings with McConnell supporters from their home state of Kentucky.\n\nChao has met at least 10 times with politicians and business leaders from the state in response to requests from McConnell\u2019s office, according to documents provided to Politico by the watchdog group American Oversight.

Bush, told Politico it \u201chappened a lot\u201d that lawmakers asked him to meet with constituents traveling to Washington, \u201cand then you would meet with them.\u201d Mineta said a request from a member of Congress would carry additional weight, regardless of what state that member was from.\n\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re going to meet with people from your home state,\u201d added a former DOT official from the Obama administration who asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly about the department she once worked for.\n\nBut Evers from American Oversight contended that in these emails, Chao\u2019s staff appear to go out of their way to make McConnell\u2019s Kentucky contacts \u201cfeel special.\u201d In one March 2017 email to Inman, requesting a meeting between Chao and the group Kentuckians for Better Transportation, Carmack suggested that if Chao couldn\u2019t make it, perhaps \u201can assistant secretary or 2\u201d could. \u201cThat way it is not taking up the Secretary\u2019s time but they feel special,\u201d Carmack continued.\n\nInman had previously told Carmack that Chao\u2019s office was planning to decline the meeting. But the meeting later appeared on Chao\u2019s calendar for the following May 17.\n\nA Politico review of two months of Chao\u2019s calendar over her first 14 months in office doesn\u2019t reveal a particular preference for Kentucky visitors \u2014 in more than 100 meetings and phone calls with people outside the executive branch, none had an apparent Kentucky connection.\n\nStill, Evers highlighted two instances when DOT\u2019s Inman instructed McConnell staffers to flag requests from Kentuckians for him in addition to sending them to Chao\u2019s schedulers, \u201cto make sure we take an extra look at\u201d them.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary has indicated if you have a [Kentucky-]specific issue that we should flag for her attention to please continue to go through your normal channels but feel free to contact me directly as well so we can monitor or follow up as necessary,\u201d Inman wrote to McConnell\u2019s then-chief of staff, Brian McGuire, in an email from Feb. 28, 2017.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a normal channel and a Kentucky channel,\u201d Evers said. \u201cIt would be surprising if there was also an Arizona channel and a California channel.\u201d\n\nAnd, on a tentative list of staff duties Inman shared with McConnell\u2019s office soon after he started, \u201cKentucky\u201d is listed as one of Inman\u2019s responsibilities. No other state is included in any of the other 26 staffers\u2019 list of duties.\n\nInman, who became Chao\u2019s chief of staff last month, was a Republican political operative in Kentucky before joining DOT. He communicated frequently with McConnell staff for most of his first year in the job, until an assistant secretary for government affairs was confirmed.\n\nThe email cache is also sprinkled with instances of McConnell staffers referring to meeting seekers\u2019 personal ties to the couple and their status as GOP supporters.\n\nIn one email thread from March 2017, McConnell\u2019s staff describes Hart County, Ky., Judge/Executive Terry Martin \u2014 the county\u2019s top elected official \u2014 as a \u201cloyal supporter\u201d and \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nChao met with Martin two weeks later and again a year later.\n\nShe met on March 20, 2017, with representatives from the Pennyrile Area Development District, who had gotten similar praise and were interested in discussing their long-running priority of redesignating the Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway as Interstate 169. President Donald Trump signed into law a bill sponsored by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), designating the highway I-169 in May 2017.\n\nIn another February 2017 email exchange, Carmack asked Inman to set up a meeting with two Kentucky county judge/executives who wanted to talk about bridge and highway problems in their counties. \u201cAlways value your input,\u201d Inman responded.\n\nHarlan County Judge/Executive Dan Mosley, who met with Chao in April 2017 about widening and improving a flood-prone stretch of U.S. 421, said in an interview with Politico that Chao was \u201cone of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met\u201d and that \u201cher commitment to transportation issues\u201d was evident in their meeting. After they met, a Federal Highway Administration official came to evaluate the project, and eventually the state allocated $800,000 to start the project, Mosley told Politico.\n\nBoone County Judge/Executive Gary Moore, who asked for and, in June 2018, received a $68 million DOT grant for two interstate interchanges,said he met with Chao and asked for her support for the grant at his December 2017 meeting with her. Boone County had been seeking a federal grant for this since at least 2017.\n\nCooperation between the two offices goes in both directions, the emails indicate. In May 2017, a group of real estate company representatives and public officials from China enjoyed a Capitol tour organized jointly by Chao\u2019s and McConnell\u2019s offices. The group \u201cwas thrilled to get the VIP treatment by [McConnell\u2019s] office and were particularly excited to hear that the leader\u2019s office was normally off limits to normal guests,\u201d Melissa Fwu of Chao\u2019s office wrote in an email to a McConnell aide.\n\nOversight groups aren\u2019t just worried about the meetings Chao is granting, however. A previously unreleased report from the watchdog group Restore Public Trust questions the 2018 choice of a town of about 25,000 residents situated near the Tennessee, Ohio, Cumberland and Mississippi rivers, as the site of a new DOT maritime gateway office intended to help coordinate between port operators and government bodies to help improve freight movement on inland waterways.\n\nPaducah is the smallest city to host one of DOT\u2019s 10 maritime gateway offices. The nine other such offices are in major cities such as New York, Chicago and Miami.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of stuff the American public hates,\u201d said Caroline Ciccone, executive director of Restore Public Trust, adding that a \u201cprudent elected official\u201d will avoid favoritism \u201cnot just because it looks bad, it\u2019s because it is bad.\u201d\n\nBut a DOT spokesperson who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the department chose Paducah because it\u2019s \u201calways been a natural hub for regional inland waterway traffic,\u201d given its proximity to four major rivers and the presence of \u201cmore U.S.-flag inland waterway operators than anywhere else in the nation.\u201d The low cost of living also made it attractive, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson said a strategic analysis, undertaken by the Maritime Administration in 2015, resulted in a decision to close one of two gateway offices in California in favor of one on the inland waterways to support the St. Louis office. Paducah was chosen out of five inland waterway locations that were evaluated.\n\nDeb Calhoun, senior vice president of the Waterways Council, called Paducah \u201cthe epicenter of the inland marine industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of the major inland operators have offices in Paducah,\u201d she told Politico. \u201cThere is a maritime training center. And each year, hundreds of inland marine related companies gather for an annual river industry awards event.\u201d\n\n"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/michael-flynn-saudi-arabia-1174531", "text": "Michael Flynn, who is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to unrelated charges of lying to the FBI, has acknowledged he advised a subsidiary of IP3 about its nuclear plan. | Saul Loebb/AFP/Getty Images Congress House report lays bare White House feud over Saudi nuclear push\n\nA consulting firm once linked to former national security adviser Michael Flynn is continuing to push President Donald Trump to endorse a plan to build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia, despite warnings from whistleblowers that their earlier efforts appeared to violate U.S. law, House Democrats said in a report Tuesday.\n\nThe consultants from the firm IP3 International, which organized a White House meeting between the president and nuclear industry executives last week, were involved in pushing a \"Middle East Marshall Plan\" in the early days of the Trump administration that sparked concerns about Flynn's conflicts of interest. That plan would have involved building dozens of nuclear reactors across the region, in a way that would have circumvented U.S. laws designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFlynn, who is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to unrelated charges of lying to the FBI, has acknowledged he advised a subsidiary of IP3 about its nuclear plan.\n\n\"The whistleblowers who came forward have expressed significant concerns about the potential procedural and legal violations connected with rushing through a plan to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia,\" the report prepared for Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said.\n\nIn addition, the panel said, \"They have warned of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes.\"\n\nThe report does not indicate IP3 did anything illegal, but it is the most thorough accounting to date of how the firm used its connections to advance its concept through potentially conflicted Trump administration officials.\n\nKeep up with POLITICO Playbook The 2020 Election.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe report's release comes amid the Trump administration's efforts to beat out competitors from Russia and China to develop multibillion-dollar nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia \u2014 and after Trump drew sharp criticism for downplaying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's role in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year.\n\nAnd it comes ahead of a trip by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, to the Middle East later this month to discuss economic development.\n\nIP3 organized a meeting with Trump last week where executives from companies such as Westinghouse, General Electric, Exelon, Centrus Energy, NuScale, TerraPower and LightBridge pitched the president to help them win contracts in the Middle East and elsewhere. The Trump administration is already on board with that effort, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry traveled to Saudi Arabia as recently as December to discuss a nuclear power deal, including developing a so-called 123 agreement that would limit the Saudi nuclear program to civilian uses.\n\nThat 123 agreement, named for a section of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, is designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, an increasing source of tensions in the Middle East following Trump's decision to pull out of the Iranian nuclear pact. Salman has said the kingdom would quickly move to develop nuclear weaponsif Tehran succeeded in obtaining them.\n\nBut IP3 executives were preparing to move ahead with a deal to build nuclear plants in Saudi Arabia without an agreement to limit the country's program to a civilian energy production, according to the House report.\n\nBased on accounts and documents provided by whistleblowers, the report said one of IP3\u2019s top officials delivered the firm's nuclear plan to Flynn on Jan. 28, 2017 to pass along to Trump, and another document at the same time for Trump to recommend to the National Security Council. The firm kept pushing its idea through various channels even though political and career officials warned it circumvented national security protocol.\n\nIn another letter to Salman, IP3's co-founders boasted of the inroads the firm had made with the Trump administration, even after the president forced Flynn out in February 2017 for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russia. Three of the officials who signed the letter \u2014 retired Gen. Jack Keane, retired Rear Adm. Michael Hewitt and former Reagan administration national security adviser Robert \u201cBud\u201d McFarlane \u2014 attended last week\u2019s meeting with Trump.\n\n\u201cThe agreements by President Trump and Mohammed bin Salman have established the framework for our unique opportunity to take the next steps with IP3 and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Keane, Hewitt, McFarlane and retired Gen. Keith Alexander wrote in a March 17, 2017, letter to the crown prince.\n\nAlso pressing the case for the Saudi plan at the White House were former NSC official Derek Harvey, as well as Trump confidant Tom Barrack \u2014 who has major business ties in the Middle East \u2014 and ex-Trump deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, a former Paul Manafort associate who has since pleaded guilty to conspiring against the United States and making false statements.\n\nBut whistleblowers warned the White House against the nuclear plan. One unidentified official in the Democrats' report told NSC staff they \u201cabsolutely should not include the issue\u201d in Trump\u2019s briefing materials and called IP3\u2019s plan \u201ca scheme for these generals to make some money.\u201d\n\nNow, with a civilian nuclear program push gaining steam at the White House, security experts have raised concerns about the process, and the re-emergence of IP3 similarly troubled them.\n\n\u201cI see a problem that the Trump administration is giving time to IP3 and their ideas,\u201d said Chen Kane, director of the Middle East nonproliferation program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in an interview with POLITICO.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the people previously pushing this scheme got the meeting with the president after all their attempts to get meetings elsewhere throughout the administration is suspicious,\u201d said a former senior congressional staffer who worked on nuclear matters.\n\nThe White House and IP3 did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.\n\nIP3 has repeatedly denied that it ever employed or paid Flynn in any capacity despite the fact Flynn listed that he served as an adviser to its subsidiary, IronBridge Group Inc., on his financial disclosure.\n\n\u201cMike Flynn was never in IP3, he was never paid by IP3, he never advised IP3, he never had a stake in IP3,\u201d Hewitt told POLITICO after last week\u2019s meeting with Trump.\n\nIP3 officials, however, acknowledge they have a relationship with Flynn and that they continue to support efforts to build reactors in the Middle East. McFarlane said they were all connected through ACU Strategic Partners, a company that for years had pushed a similar idea of building nuclear reactors in the Middle East through a consortium of companies. McFarlane said he, Hewitt and others left ACU when its managing partner, Andrew Copson, suggested they partner with Russia for the project.\n\n\u201cMike [Flynn] then was chosen, appointed to the job in the Trump administration and it\u2019s fair to say we had \u2014 IP3 as individuals \u2014 had said, 'Mike, we\u2019re not up for working with Russia,'\u201d McFarlane, who described his role at ACU as \u201cparticipating in meetings,\u201d told POLITICO last week.\n\nThe report released Tuesday covers a period through March 2017, which the committee acknowledged was a narrow time frame. But its contents underscore experts\u2019 worries that Flynn and his administration allies are continuing to push for a rushed and politically compromised nuclear cooperation deal with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThose security and ethical quandaries compelled NSC legal adviser John Eisenberg to issue a directive stopping all work on the IP3 nuclear plant proposal and the Middle East Marshall Plan concept, the report said. Another source familiar with IP3\u2019s activities during this period separately told POLITICO that NSC staff were forbidden from meeting with IP3 officials.\n\n\u201cAccording to the whistleblowers, on March 24, 2017, multiple employees raised to the NSC Legal Advisor their concerns, including a detailed description of reported unethical and potentially illegal actions by General Flynn and Mr. Harvey,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn response to these concerns, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster reportedly informed NSC staff that they should cease working on the IP3 proposal. However, NSC staff remained concerned because the same individuals continued their work on IP3\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\nMcFarlane told POLITICO that around that time, it became \"impossible\" to get meetings with NSC officials.\n\nMcFarlane sent the firm's nuclear expansion plan to Flynn and deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland on Jan. 28, 2017, eight days after Trump's inauguration. It was a ghost-written memo from Flynn to Trump and another draft memo \u201cfor the president to sign\u201d directing other agencies to give Barrack the lead on implementing IP3\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cTom Barrack has been thoroughly briefed on this strategy and wants to run it for you. He\u2019s perfect for the job. Rex and Jim are supportive of Tom\u2019s focus on this also,\u201d the draft memorandum with Flynn\u2019s name on it said. \u201cRex\u201d and \u201cJim\u201d apparently referred to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\n\u201cIn the enclosed memo you would call upon the relevant cabinet officers to lend their support to this historic program. I recommend that you sign it,\u201d the memo continued.\n\nIP3 has its eyes on Saudi Arabia\u2019s plans to build two nuclear reactors, as it hopes the companies it collaborates with could provide security training, workforce development and other services should a U.S. firm land the contract, McFarlane said. He said IP3 has \u201cno formal relationships\u201d with companies. Westinghouse Electric Co., considered the only U.S. firm that could readily build reactors, is in the running for a Saudi contract.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia has stymied the efforts by refusing to sign an International Atomic Energy Agency protocol to permit expanded inspections beyond verifying the location of nuclear material. The U.S. has never signed a 123 agreement with a nation that hasn\u2019t committed to that step.\n\nSaudi Arabia also has said it won\u2019t forswear uranium enrichment and reprocessing, the steps necessary to make nuclear weapons. The United Arab Emirates inked a 123 agreement with such a provision. But Saudi Arabia noted that the Iran nuclear deal that Trump walked away from did not forever ban that country from those steps, as the terms were due to sunset after 2031. That\u2019s put U.S. negotiators in a tight spot.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has an interest in not seeing the expansion of enrichment and reprocessing technology in the region. It would be a mistake to compromise these principles too far,\u201d said Thomas Countryman, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s top arms control and nuclear proliferation official at the State Department. He nonetheless called the interest from U.S. nuclear companies in building Saudi reactors \u201ca natural partnership\u201d given the nations\u2019 long-standing economic relationship."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/tom-steyer-impeach-trump-1176009", "text": "Hedge fund billionaire and Democratic fund-raiser Tom Steyer said his effort is simply giving voice to the tens of thousands of Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler\u2019s constituents who signed his petition indicating their support for impeaching the president. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images politics \u2018Tom who?\u2019: Dems brush off Steyer\u2019s impeachment push Democrats are defending Rep.

Hakeem Jeffries, a fellow New York Democrat and Judiciary Committee member who also has found himself under scrutiny from the left, quipped: \u201cTom who?\u201d\n\nKeep up with POLITICO Playbook The 2020 Election.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign that even as Steyer\u2019s involvement is causing some headaches for Democrats, lawmakers are rallying behind Nadler and dismissing demands among the Democratic base to go after Trump sooner rather than later.\n\nDemocrats are particularly frustrated that Steyer refuses to rule out backing challengers in next year\u2019s House primaries less than two months after Democrats took the majority in the first place. In addition to Nadler, Steyer\u2019s initial targets include Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) \u2014 and the billionaire has vowed to take his campaign to rank-and-file Democrats\u2019 districts, too.\n\n\u201cWe should not be spending money now defending incumbents in primaries. It\u2019s stupid,\u201d said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a Judiciary Committee member who has backed impeaching Trump and frequently skewers the president on Twitter. \u201cI fully support the chairman, and to do a primary challenge against him is stupid.\u201d\n\nNadler\u2019s office declined to comment on the record for this story, but his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \u2014 who uniformly backed the chairman\u2019s reluctance to hold impeachment hearings until more evidence against the president emerges \u2014 remain in lockstep behind him as they dismiss the growing pressure campaign as irrelevant and counterproductive.\n\n\u201cHis district, mostly the West Side of New York \u2014 there\u2019s not hardly a more liberal place in New York,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a member of the Judiciary panel. \u201cTom Steyer can run some ads, but it doesn\u2019t compare to what people in the delis would say to Jerry in the West Side of New York.\u201d\n\nPrivately, Democrats \u2014 and their Republican counterparts \u2014 on Capitol Hill believe the committee eventually will hold impeachment proceedings against Trump. Those hearings would begin only when Democrats feel that they are on solid ground, based on facts and evidence that emerges, to do so.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough for Steyer. In an interview before his town hall on Tuesday night, Steyer said his effort is simply giving voice to the tens of thousands of Nadler\u2019s constituents who signed his petition indicating their support for impeaching the president.\n\n\u201cHe needs to know where they stand. This isn\u2019t about me for one second,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cThere is a split here between the elected officials inside the Beltway, and American citizens. We need these hearings to bring the truth to the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey voted for Congressman Nadler because they want some action,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why they turned out.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed about using his PAC\u2019s resources to back challengers to Nadler or other House Democrats, Steyer wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming all of these Democrats are going to listen to their constituents and go, 'Oh my gosh, we really need to get this show on the road,'\u201d he said.\n\nIn multiple interviews, however, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s Democratic members pushed back on Steyer and revealed a united front in favor of Nadler\u2019s strategy on impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to govern from the outside than it is from the inside,\u201d said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a former police detective who praised Nadler\u2019s \u201cstrategic and methodical\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s frustrated,\u201d Demings said of Steyer\u2019s efforts. \u201cBut frustration alone is never enough to lead any type of hearing or investigation.\u201d\n\nStill, Nadler is taking concrete steps to placate his left flank, lawmakers say.\n\nHe\u2019s vowed to continue pressing now-former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker about his brief supervision of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, even threatening to subpoena him for a deposition. Earlier this month, Nadler hired Norm Eisen, a former White House attorney in the Obama administration, and Barry Berke, a criminal defense lawyer specializing in white-collar crimes, as legal consultants for the committee. Both have openly mused about Trump\u2019s alleged crimes, including obstruction of justice. And later this month, Nadler is expected to spearhead a legislative effort to reverse the president\u2019s use of a national emergency declaration to build a border wall.\n\n\u201cThey know abuse of power, they know obstruction of justice,\u201d Cohen said of Eisen and Berke. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that Chairman Nadler is not proceeding in the right direction and doing it in any way but a scholarly, diligent method \u2014 and that\u2019s what we need to be successful.\u201d\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, who counts Steyer as a constituent of her San Francisco district, said the billionaire\u2019s efforts are a \u201cwaste of time and money\u201d and suggested that Steyer should focus his efforts on defeating Republicans rather than undermining Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, you are by definition as an advocate dissatisfied, relentless and persistent. Whatever the electeds are doing is a compromise, it\u2019s not the purity of what we want,\u201d Pelosi said in an interview recently. \u201cI understand that, but they have to also understand that if you're going to succeed on the path that you\u2019re on, you have to do it right.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are giddy at the prospect that Democrats are grappling with an insurgency within their own party. Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said Nadler is already bowing to the pressure from donors like Steyer, citing the Eisen and Berke hirings as evidence.\n\n\u201cTom Steyer was trying to impeach the president in November 2016 \u2014 I mean, let\u2019s get a break here,\u201d Collins said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that you\u2019re taking a chairman who has just taken over the committee for the first time in eight years, and you\u2019re forcing him to do stuff that he knows is not practical at this point. I think it\u2019s affecting a lot of our committee. It\u2019s just sad.\u201d\n\nYet those close to Nadler on the committee say he\u2019s not worried about the pressure campaign and doesn\u2019t believe a credible primary challenger could emerge. But Democrats who have been down this road before warned that Steyer\u2019s efforts could backfire.\n\nJulian Epstein, who served as chief counsel for the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Democrats during the fight to impeach President Bill linton, said if Nadler bends to pressure from Steyer, he risks mirroring Republicans\u2019 unsuccessful playbook when they tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to oust Clinton from office 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to impeachment by politicizing it and trying to strong-arm potential allies,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cThat will only misserve the goal of impeachment by branding it as liberal billionaires\u2019 pet project rather than a constitutional undertaking driven by facts and law.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/17/trump-russia-collusion-adam-schiff-1173434", "text": "\u201cYou can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia, Rep.

The Justice Department on Thursday referenced McCabe\u2019s dismissal from the bureau, which followed that report, in its statement disputing his claims.\n\n\u201cHe should be held to the same standard anyone else that the Justice Department has looked at in this investigation or any other,\u201d Schiff said.\n\n"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/20/2020-candidates-social-media-attack-1176018", "text": "Recent posts that have received widespread dissemination include racially inflammatory memes and messaging involving former Rep.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas), four of the most prominent announced or prospective candidates for president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA POLITICO review of recent data extracted from Twitter and from other platforms, as well as interviews with data scientists and digital campaign strategists, suggests that the goal of the coordinated barrage appears to be undermining the nascent candidacies through the dissemination of memes, hashtags, misinformation and distortions of their positions. But the divisive nature of many of the posts also hints at a broader effort to sow discord and chaos within the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nThe cyber propaganda \u2014 which frequently picks at the rawest, most sensitive issues in public discourse \u2014 is being pushed across a variety of platforms and with a more insidious approach than in the 2016 presidential election, when online attacks designed to polarize and mislead voters first surfaced on a massive scale.\n\nRecent posts that have received widespread dissemination include racially inflammatory memes and messaging involving Harris, O\u2019Rourke and Warren. In Warren\u2019s case, a false narrative surfaced alleging that a blackface doll appeared on a kitchen cabinet in the background of the senator\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Instagram livestream.\n\nNot all of the activity is organized. Much of it appears to be organic, a reflection of the politically polarizing nature of some of the candidates. But there are clear signs of a coordinated effort of undetermined size that shares similar characteristics with the computational propaganda attacks launched by online trolls at Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency in the 2016 presidential campaign , which special counsel Robert Mueller accused of aiming to undermine the political process and elevate Donald Trump.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Over a recent 30-day period, between 2 percent and 15 percent of all Twitter mentions of the four candidates emanated in some way from within that cluster of accounts, according to the Guardians.ai findings. In that time frame, all four candidates collectively had 6.8 million mentions on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe can conclusively state that a large group of suspicious accounts that were active in one of the largest influence operations of the 2018 cycle is now engaged in sustained and ongoing activity for the 2020 cycle,\u201d Horvath said.\n\nAmarnath Gupta, a research scientist at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California at San Diego who monitors social media activity, said he\u2019s also seen a recent surge in Twitter activity negatively targeting three candidates \u2014 O\u2019Rourke, Harris and Warren.\n\nThat increased activity includes a rise in the sheer volume of tweets, the rate at which they are being posted and the appearance of \u201ccluster behavior\u201d tied to the three candidates.\n\n\u201cI can say that from a very, very cursory look, a lot of the information is negatively biased with respect to sentiment analysis,\u201d said Gupta, who partnered with Guardians.ai on a 2018 study.\n\nAccording to the Guardians.ai analysis, Harris attracted the most overall Twitter activity among the 2020 candidates it looked at, with more than 2.5 million mentions over the 30-day period.\n\nShe was also among the most targeted. One widely seen tweet employed racist and sexist stereotypes in an attempt to sensationalize Harris\u2019 relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. That tweet \u2014 and subsequent retweets and mentions tied to it \u2014 made 8.6 million \u201cpotential impressions\u201d online, according to Guardians.ai, an upper limit calculation of the number of people who might have seen it based on the accounts the cluster follows, who follows accounts within the cluster and who has engaged with the tweet.\n\nAnother racially charged tweet was directed at O\u2019Rourke. The Twitter profile of the user where it originated indicates the account was created in May 2018, but it had authored just one tweet since then \u2014 in January, when the account announced it had breaking news about the former Texas congressman leaving a message using racist language on an answering machine in the 1990s. That tweet garnered 1.3 million potential impressions on the platform, according to Guardians.ai.\n\nA separate Guardians.ai study that looked at the focus of the 200 account group on voter fraud and false and/or misleading narratives about election integrity \u2014 published just before the midterm elections and co-authored by Horvath, Zach Verdin and Alicia Serrani \u2014 reported that the accounts generated or were mentioned in more than 140 million tweets over the prior year.\n\nThat cluster of accounts was the driving force behind an effort to aggressively advance conspiracy theories in the 2018 midterms, ranging from misinformation about voter fraud to narratives involving a caravan coming to the United States, and even advocacy of violence.\n\nHorvath asserts that the activity surrounding the cluster represents an evolution of misinformation and amplification tactics that began in mid-to-late 2018. The initial phase that began in 2016 was marked by the creation of thousands of accounts that were more easily detected as bots or as coordinated activity.\n\nThe new activity, however, centers on a refined group of core accounts \u2014 the very same accounts that surfaced in the group\u2019s 2018 voter fraud study. Some of the accounts are believed to be highly sophisticated synthetic accounts operated by people attempting to influence conversations, while others are coordinated in some way by actors who have identified real individuals already tweeting out a desired message.\n\nTens of thousands of other accounts then work in concert to amplify the core group through mentions and retweets to drive what appears, on the surface, to be organic virality.\n\nOperatives with digital firms, political campaigns and other social media monitoring groups also report seeing a recent surge in false narratives or negative memes against 2020 candidates.\n\nA recent analysis from the social media intelligence firm Storyful detected spikes in misinformation activity over social media platforms and online comment boards in the days after each of the 2020 candidates launched their presidential bids, beginning with Warren\u2019s announcement on Dec. 31.\n\nFringe news websites and social media platforms, Storyful found, played a significant role in spreading anti-Warren sentiment in the days after she announced her candidacy on Dece. 31. Using a variety of keyword searches for mentions of Warren, the firm reported evidence of \u201cspam or bot-like\u201d activity on Facebook and Twitter from some of the top posters.\n\nKelly Jones, a researcher with Storyful who tracked suspicious activity in the three days after the campaign announcements of Harris, Warren, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), said she\u2019s seen a concerted push over separate online message boards to build false or derogatory narratives.\n\nAmong the fringe platforms Storyful identified were 4Chan and 8Chan, where messages appeared calling on commenters to quietly wreak havoc against Warren on social media or in the comments section under news stories.\n\nAccording to a Guardians.ai analysis, Sen. Kamala Harris attracted the most overall Twitter activity among the 2020 candidates it looked at, with more than 2.5 million mentions over the 30-day period. She was also among the most targeted. | Elise Amendola/AP Photo\n\n\u201cPoint out that she used to be Republican but switched sides and is a spy for them now. Use this quote out of context: \u2018I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets,\u2019\u201d wrote one poster on the 4Chan message board.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of that rhetoric for nearly each candidate that comes out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere is a call to action on these fringe sites. The field is going to be so crowded that they say \u2018OK: Operation Divide the Left.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn official with the Harris campaign said they suspect bad actors pushing misinformation and false narratives about the California Democrat are trying to divide African Americans, or to get the media to pay outsized attention to criticism designed to foster divisions among the Democratic primary electorate.\n\nResearchers and others interviewed for this story say they cannot conclusively point to the actors behind the coordinated activity. It\u2019s unclear if they are rogue hackers, political activists or, as some contend, foreign state actors such as Russia, since it bears the hallmarks of earlier foreign attacks. One of the objectives of the activity, they say, is to divide the left by making the Democratic presidential primary as chaotic and toxic as possible.\n\nTeddy Goff, who served as Obama for America\u2019s digital director, broadly described the ongoing organized efforts as the work of \u201ca hodgepodge. It\u2019s a bit of an unholy alliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are state supporters and funders of this stuff. Russia. North Korea is believed to be one, Iran is another,\u201d he said. \u201cIn certain cases it appears coordinated, but whether coordinated or not, there are clearly actors attempting to influence the primary by exacerbating divisions within the party, painting more moderate candidates as unpalatable to progressives and more progressive candidates as unpalatable to more mainstream Dems.\u201d\n\nA high-ranking official in the Sanders campaign expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the impact of misinformation on social media, calling it \u201ca type of political cyber warfare that\u2019s clearly having an impact on the democratic process.\u201d The official said the Sanders campaign views the activity it\u2019s already seeing as involving actors that are both foreign and domestic.\n\nBoth Twitter and Facebook, which owns Instagram, have reported taking substantial measures since 2016 to identify and block foreign actors and others who violate platform rules.\n\nWhile Twitter would not specifically respond to questions about the Guardians.ai findings, last year the company reported challenging millions of suspect accounts every month, including those exhibiting \u201cspammy and automated behavior.\u201d After attempts to authenticate the accounts through email or by phone, Twitter suspended 75 percent of the accounts it challenged from January to June 2018.\n\nIn January 2019, Twitter published an accounting of efforts to combat foreign interference over political conversations happening on the platform. Earlier efforts included releasing data sets of potential foreign information operations that have appeared on Twitter, which were composed of 3,841 accounts affiliated with the IRA, that originated in Russia, and 770 other accounts that potentially originated in Iran.\n\n\u201cOur investigations are global and ongoing, but the data sets we recently released are ones we\u2019re able to reliably attribute and are disclosing now,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cWe\u2019ll share more information if and when it\u2019s available.\u201d\n\nFacebook says it has 30,000 people working on safety and security and that it is increasingly blocking and removing fake accounts. The company also says it has brought an unprecedented level of transparency to political advertising on its platform.\n\nAt this early stage, the campaigns themselves appear ill-equipped to handle the online onslaught. Their digital operations are directed toward fundraising and organizing while their social media arms are designed to communicate positive messages and information. While some have employed monitoring practices, defensive measures typically take a backseat \u2014 especially since so much remains unknown about the sources and the scale of the attacks.\n\nOne high-level operative for a top-tier 2020 candidate noted the monumental challenges facing individual campaigns \u2014 even the ones with the most sophisticated digital teams. The problem already appears much larger than the resources available to any candidate at the moment, the official said.\n\nAlex Kellner, managing director with Bully Pulpit Interactive, the top digital firm for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, warns that campaigns that don\u2019t have a serious infrastructure set up to combat misinformation and dictate their own online messaging will be the most vulnerable to attack in 2020.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to be a serious part of any successful campaign: monitoring this and working with the platforms to shut down bad behavior,\u201d Kellner said.\n\nKellner said that even though platforms like Twitter and Facebook have ramped up internal efforts to weed out bad actors, the flow of fake news and misinformation attacks against 2020 candidates is already strong.\n\n\u201cAll the infrastructure we\u2019ve seen in 2016 and 2018 is already in full force. And in 2020 it\u2019s only going to get worse,\u201d Kellner said, pointing to negative memes attacking Warren on her claims of Native American heritage and memes surrounding Harris\u2019 relationship with Brown.\n\nThe proliferation of fake news, rapidly changing techniques by malicious actors and an underprepared field of Democratic candidates could make for a volatile primary election season.\n\n\u201cModerates and centrists and Democratic candidates still don\u2019t understand what happened in 2016, and they didn\u2019t realize, like Hillary Clinton, that she wasn\u2019t just running a presidential campaign, she was involved in a global information war,\u201d Horvath said. \u201cDemocratic candidates and presidential candidates in the center and on the right who don\u2019t understand that aren\u2019t just going to have a difficult campaign, they\u2019re going to allow their campaign to be an unwitting amplifier of someone else\u2019s attempts to further divide Americans.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/20/bernie-sanders-2020-first-day-fundraising-money-1176072", "text": "Sen.

Sherrod Brown has railed against banks but also developed relationships with them, setting him apart from potential presidential rivals.\n\nIn the Senate, Sherrod Brown is known as a scourge of Wall Street. But in a Democratic presidential primary with fellow Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren thundering away at bankers, Brown is viewed by many in the industry as a reasonable alternative.\n\nThe Ohio senator has called for breaking up the big banks and has even fought against Democratic colleagues who supported financial deregulation. But according to bank representatives, Wall Street watchdogs and others who have worked closely with him in Congress, Brown has also earned a reputation as someone open to dialogue with the industry in his role as the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. He has taken corporate PAC money and shown a practical streak focused on protecting workers in his home state, where finance is a major employer.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBrown\u2019s nuanced relationship with the banking industry illustrates the leftward shift in the Democratic Party and the rationale of his possible presidential campaign, as he travels the country arguing that he is a consistent progressive who doesn\u2019t go too far and has proven how to win in the red-trending Midwest. Warren and Sanders have taken more belligerent approaches to finance, while Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris have all been criticized at times as too close to big banks.\n\nAnd then, in the middle, there\u2019s Brown, who has built a reputation as a fighter on finance but could yet be outflanked on the issue in a Democratic primary.\n\n\"The financial services industry knows where it stands with Senator Brown, which isn\u2019t something that can be said for the entire Democratic presidential field,\" said Isaac Boltansky, the director of policy research for Compass Point, an investment bank. \"Senator Brown has strong views on the regulatory regime, which often places him in diametric opposition to the banking industry during key policy debates.

And we\u2019ve had some success doing that.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2008 Wall Street meltdown, Brown led a bipartisan push to break up \"too-big-to-fail\" banks. It fell short after fellow Democrats refused to join the cause. He opposed appointees picked by former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump whom he saw as too cozy with corporate America. He prodded executives like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to pay bank tellers and other workers higher wages.\n\nAnd last year, Brown led the charge against a landmark deregulation bill backed by 16 of his fellow Senate Democrats \u2014 a tense fight that played out for two weeks on the Senate floor. Brown was unable to stop the legislation, which became law in May.\n\nBut Brown isn't following potential rivals in the 2020 primary's progressive lane on some big financial issues. He does not plan to endorse a push by Warren and others on the left that would revive the Glass-Steagall law, a set of Depression-era banking restrictions that were undone during the Clinton administration. He said it was a good law but that reimposing it isn't the panacea some make it out to be.\n\n\u201cI do hear about Glass-Steagall oftentimes at town halls or whatever, but nobody\u2019s convinced me it would make an appreciable difference,\u201d Brown said. \"Breaking up the banks is important. Consumer protections are important. Higher capital standards are important. Fighting deregulation is important. Glass-Steagall is well below that in importance.\"\n\nIn an interview, Warren said she's never tried to convince Brown to sign on to her proposal to revive Glass-Steagall but said the two \"share the same values.\"\n\nBrown has been willing to listen to the finance industry's concerns and sometimes take action, especially when it comes to smaller financial institutions that call Ohio home.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Democrats\u2019 side of the ledger, he\u2019s more attractive than many others out there,\u201d said Michael Adelman, the president and CEO of the Ohio Bankers League.\n\nOne lobbyist for a large bank who declined to be named said Brown is \"always willing to have the discussion.\"\n\nBrown championed one of the first changes to Democrats' signature financial reform law, Dodd-Frank, leading to a revision in 2014 that benefited insurers facing stiff capital requirements. When Senate Republicans later sought to water down the law in significant ways, he fought back and rallied Democrats, including Warren, to back a counter-proposal targeted at helping the smallest banks.\n\nAnd before Brown tried to tank last year's bank deregulation bill, which had big benefits for regional lenders with headquarters in Ohio, he was at the negotiating table trying to forge a potential compromise with the GOP chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\n\u201cEven when I disagree with him, what I find is we can both get into the weeds pretty quick, which is a more productive conversation than just slinging slogans,\" said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who co-authored the deregulation bill that Brown opposed.\n\nBrown is often on the opposite side of the \"biggest, most dangerous banks on Wall Street,\" but most U.S. banks and financial institutions would agree with his view of the world, said Better Markets President and CEO Dennis Kelleher, who advocates for tougher finance industry oversight.\n\n\"There's nobody who says they could not get a fair hearing from Sherrod Brown,\" Kelleher said.\n\nBrown already has ideas for how the finance industry would fit into a possible presidential platform, which is likely to revolve around the \"dignity of work\" theme that he's hitting on in a tour of early primary states.\n\nThe list includes breaking up big banks, strengthening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, scrutinizing the payday lending industry and reinforcing bank capital standards.\n\nFormer Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland said there was \"a helluva lot of distance\" between Brown and other Democrats when it comes to Wall Street.\n\n\"Sherrod seems to be able to keep an appropriate distance in terms of dependency on the banking interests in a way that some of the others do not,\" he said.\n\nBut Brown is unsurprised that, to some bankers, he may be more palatable than others on the far left of the 2020 race.\n\nBrown said he works \"all the time to understand what they're doing\" as he tries to change bank behavior that may hurt consumers. Brown said he knows many Ohio bankers personally but that he's spent no more than three hours in aggregate with any Wall Street CEO.\n\n\"I don't surprise people,\" Brown said. \"My politics are what they are. If you deal with people honestly, they're more likely to understand what you're doing.\""}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/bernie-sanders-campaign-2020-1173608", "text": "Sen.

The poll found that Sanders would beat Trump by 2 percentage points in the state \u2014 despite the fact that Trump won West Virginia, 69-27, and that no Democratic presidential candidate has carried the state since 1996.\n\nTo operatives in both parties, the notion that Sanders could defeat Trump in one of the president\u2019s strongholds strains credulity. But the Sanders team is convinced the Vermont senator\u2019s appeal to independent voters, the white working class and people of color is underestimated \u2014 and could pay dividends in unexpected places in a general election. They argue that his anti-establishment and populist economic message, as well as his many years of representing rural voters, makes him competitive in not only the Rust Belt states where Hillary Clinton faltered but also potentially in deep-red states, too.\n\nThey\u2019re not just talking about West Virginia.

However, larger percentages of older voters, women and people of color want a candidate who can conquer Trump, even if they disagree with most of their platform.\n\nMost older voters, especially those of color, favored Clinton over Sanders in 2016 \u2014 and Sanders\u2019 top allies and aides have acknowledged that he has much to do to change that.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/85/56/5b8a2cba484fbbe21678f6f247be/sanders2020-thumbnail.png\" true\n\n\u201cHis peer group is harder on him across the board,\u201d said Nina Turner, president of the Sanders-founded Our Revolution, referring to older voters. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely going to have to work on bringing his peers into the fold.\u201d\n\nOne adviser to the Vermont senator said those efforts will likely need to include a persuasive argument that he can oust Trump.\n\nHis aides argue that he is well-liked in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 the three Rust Belt states that helped hand Trump the keys to the White House \u2014 so Sanders begins with a foothold.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can dispute with a straight face that Bernie Sanders is very popular in those places,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, an adviser to Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s popular with the progressive base, he\u2019s increasingly popular with the emerging electorate in the Democratic Party, and he is popular with traditional, working-class, industrial workers in those places.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 aides also point out that he has years of experience speaking to rural voters, and has enjoyed crossover appeal in his home state of Vermont. They hold up his 2016 primary victories in Wisconsin and Michigan, as well as his rallies with candidates in the 2018 midterms in those states, including with now-Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that many candidates throughout the Midwest wanted him to campaign for them in 2018,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nAmong the soft spots in the campaign\u2019s case: In the Pennsylvania primary, Sanders lost to Clinton by 12 points. And Sanders has had past troubles connecting with key components of the Democratic coalition, whose turnout will help determine the nominee\u2019s fate.\n\nAccording to an analysis of exit polling in 25 primaries , Sanders narrowly won black voters under 30 in 2016, but lost older African-Americans by large margins, who turned out at higher rates than their younger counterparts. To beat Trump, the Democratic nominee will need robust support from black voters, the most loyal part of the party\u2019s base.\n\nSanders\u2019 team believes he\u2019s in a much stronger position with black voters now than in 2016: They argue he has high favorability ratings among African-Americans, and unlike in his first presidential bid, starts with strong name ID.\n\nSanders\u2019 aides also note his current position among Latinos: In several recent 2020 surveys, he is in first place among Latinos, placing better than even former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Sanders, who eschews talking publicly about political strategy, will argue much if at all about \u201celectability\u201d himself.\n\n\"I think he needs to stay on his message,\" said Turner, \"and that message is going to make people aware that he is electable.\"\n\nBut his advisers may make the case for him, directly and indirectly. Surrogates can address the \u201celectability\u201d issue in their messaging, and staff could strategically place primary rallies in red states and throughout the Rust Belt.\n\nOther candidates have taken that route: When Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar kicked off her 2020 bid earlier this month, she said her first two stops would be in Iowa and Wisconsin, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re starting in Wisconsin because, as you remember, there wasn\u2019t a lot of campaigning in Wisconsin in 2016.\u201d\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand has highlighted her time representing a rural New York district. And Biden\u2019s allies have argued that he can win back white working-class voters who have strayed from the Democratic Party, touting the positive reception he received while campaigning for 2018 candidates in swing states such as Pennsylvania and Florida.\n\nEven Sanders, if not talking about electability outright, is hinting at it.\n\n\u201cTogether,\u201d he wrote in one of the final paragraphs of his email announcing his 2020 campaign, \u201cwe can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/bernie-sanders-presidential-campaign-2020-1173598", "text": "poster=\"https://static.politico.com/85/56/5b8a2cba484fbbe21678f6f247be/sanders2020-thumbnail.png\" true Following humiliating defeats in 2016 in states where African-Americans make up the majority of the Democratic primary electorate, Sen. Bernie Sanders is expected to attempt to do more outreach to black voters in 2020. 2020 Elections Sanders launches second bid for presidency In addition to his focus on income inequality, he plans to campaign on racial justice and a progressive foreign policy.\n\nBernie Sanders launched his second campaign for president on Tuesday \u2014 this time as a heavyweight candidate against a crowded field of liberals, instead of the passionate underdog taking on the anointed nominee.\n\nThe independent Vermont senator, running in the Democratic primary as a self-described democratic socialist, announced his campaign in an email to supporters.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut nearly four years after he kicked off his 2016 campaign at a 10-minute press conference outside the Capitol, this time will be a lot different. He starts as a front-runner in the polls, armed with near-universal name ID, a massive email donor list and a digital media empire that is unparalleled among other 2020 candidates. His left-wing policies, dismissed as fringe in 2016, have been embraced by much of the Democratic Party.\n\nSanders said he is seeking 1 million signatures for a petition backing his bid, a device that provides him with an opportunity to demonstrate the extent of his grass-roots support. He\u2019s said repeatedly that he needs that help before taking on Wall Street, \u201cthe drug companies\u201d and \u201cthe insurance companies\u201d again in a second run.\n\n\"Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution,\" Sanders wrote in his announcement email. \"Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.\"\n\nSanders\u2019 core message will remain unchanged: He will continue his decadeslong drumbeat against income inequality and a \u201ccorrupt\u201d campaign finance system. Racial justice and a progressive foreign policy will also be at the forefront of his bid, Sanders\u2019 advisers told POLITICO.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

His speech there provided a preview of his revamped message.\n\n\"Racism \u2026 exists in this country today, and it exists when the median white family owns 10 times more wealth than the median African-American family,\" he said. \"Racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality, if we are to going to create a government that works for all of us, and not just the 1 percent.\u201d\n\nAnother related focus for the campaign is winning over older voters. Sanders was estimated to have received more votes from young people in the primary than Trump and Hillary Clinton combined, and narrowly won black voters under 30. But older Americans, particularly those of color, heavily favored Clinton.\n\nJeff Weaver, an adviser to Sanders, said \"the challenge of the campaign is to reach out to older voters of all races, and how do you effectively do that \u2014 that's an important challenge for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's got to be more of a focus on talking about issues that are immediately important to older voters ... issues like health care and Social Security and retirement security,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I also think we have to draw a better connection between older and younger voters in terms of intergenerational appeal, so I think young people have to reach out to older people in their families and social circles as part of a campaign to win the support of older voters.\u201d\n\nSanders cited other reasons he's running again: to fight climate change, implement fair trade policies, take on the National Rifle Association and \"end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country and move to comprehensive immigration reform.\"\n\nThe video announcing Sanders' bid portrays him as being at the forefront of several progressive policies. The ad also spotlights Sanders\u2019 efforts to cut off U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, a hint that foreign policy will play a bigger role in his second campaign. Critics assailed him in 2016 as being light on international affairs.\n\nMichael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, on Tuesday called Sanders a \"self-avowed socialist who wants to double your taxes so the government can take over your health care.\"\n\nAn average of several recent polls compiled by RealClearPolitics shows Sanders in second place in a Democratic primary with 17 percent, behind former Vice President Joe Biden by about 10 points. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is in third with about 11 percent, and no other candidate breaks 10 percent.\n\nA December email from Sanders demonstrates the small-dollar fundraising muscle that he enters the race with: A message about a potential run raised about $300,000 from nearly 11,000 donations, according to a Sanders aide. The average donation was $27. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) raised about the same amount online the day she launched her exploratory committee.\n\nDavid Duhalde, political director of the Sanders-founded Our Revolution, said the senator also benefits from the rise of left-wing groups such as his since 2016, as well as from the general move leftward of the Democratic electorate. Progressive activists, Duhalde said, are \u201cready to hit the door and phones for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe country has dramatically transformed since 2008 and 2016 in ways that I think many people in the Beltway don\u2019t recognize, or don\u2019t want to admit,\u201d he said.\n\nDuhalde said Our Revolution counts more than 250,000 members across the country.\n\nMelissa Byrne, a 2016 Sanders veteran, said many of the first team\u2019s young staffers are also now armed with more expertise, after having worked on other campaigns and other political operations: \u201cYou have this whole crew of people who are a whole lot more experienced and confident.\u201d\n\nBut there will also be difficulties for Sanders in 2020. A few weeks before he launched his second bid, POLITICO and The New York Times reported on alleged sexual misconduct and harassment in his 2016 campaign. Sanders has apologized to the women who said they were sexually harassed by other employees on his campaign.\n\nSanders, who is 77, will also undoubtedly face questions about his age. And the left-wing lane that he had virtually all to himself in 2016 will be more crowded. He won\u2019t have the benefit of absorbing any anti-Clinton votes in 2020, either. And many of his opponents have said they support the policies that served as the foundation of his 2016 campaign, including \u201cMedicare-for-All,\u201d free college tuition and the $15 minimum wage.\n\nSanders\u2019 team is making the bet that his long-held beliefs on progressive issues will set him apart.\n\n\"People in many ways are rightfully cynical about politics,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cAnd the fact that somebody has been consistent, including when it was not easy and including when it was perceived by many in the establishment to be politically disadvantageous to have stood for those issues, I think signals to voters that one is truly committed to those issues and that the person will aggressively pursue those policies and not trade them away when it\u2019s hard.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/michael-bloomberg-network-2020-1173605", "text": "Michael Bloomberg says he plans to decide whether he'll run for president by month's end, capping a monthslong, data-intensive exercise of poll testing and organizing Democratic focus groups. | Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images 2020 elections \u2018Are you with us?\u2019: Bloomberg calls in his chits The billionaire looks to his philanthropic network for support as he considers 2020 bid.\n\nFrom shuttering coal-fired power plants to fighting the gun lobby, obesity and Big Tobacco, Michael Bloomberg\u2019s philanthropy has given away $6.4 billion and earned the love and respect of progressive-minded activists across the country.\n\nThe question is whether that goodwill is enough to fuel a Democratic presidential primary campaign.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe network of Bloomberg Philanthropies recipients is vast includes mayors throughout the country as well as grassroots climate change, gun control and education advocates and others who could form a ready-made army of campaign supporters, volunteers and paid staffers.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s political team is beginning to press the issue.

Let\u2019s see where we are.\u201d\n\nAsked again about conversations he had concerning the topic, Feinblatt spoke about Bloomberg\u2019s \u201cgold standard\u201d record on gun safety.\n\nSo is that a no? he was asked. \u201cI\u2019m trying to answer the question as frankly as I possibly can.\"\n\nOne reason for the discomfort in discussing the blurred lines between Bloomberg\u2019s philanthropic contributions and his political ambitions is that Everytown and other groups Bloomberg has supported don\u2019t want to appear to undercut their mission by taking sides. They have a strong affinity for the billionaire but fear appearing to be a campaign tool.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s advisers say he recognizes the challenges presented by a presidential campaign \u2014 he\u2019s reluctant to step back from his charitable work. That\u2019s not the only issue that has surfaced: he\u2019d have to step away from the Bloomberg media empire while its reporters cover their boss\u2019 race.\n\nSheekey said Bloomberg\u2019s efforts to avoid conflicts of interest would be akin to erecting a virtual Great Wall of China.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a Bloomberg campaign that didn\u2019t start with a very good lawyer and a very good accountant,\u201d Sheekey said.\n\nSheekey said there are people in at least half the states who are ready to take a leave of absence to help Bloomberg if he runs.\n\n\u201cIs there a network of people like that? Yes. Have we spoken to many members of that network? Yes. And may they take a leave of absence to work on the campaign? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cMike Bloomberg has hundreds of people around him who, when Mike Bloomberg says, \u2018This is what we\u2019re doing next,\u2019 I don\u2019t have to call them. They call me.\u201d\n\nEven if a Bloomberg campaign could tap that network of supporters, his team is aware there are other hurdles that the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat would face in a primary and from progressive activists who reject his centrist politics or think he hasn\u2019t done enough.\n\nFor instance, Bloomberg has contributed $218 million for clean-energy efforts that, among other results, has led to the closure of 282 coal-fired power plants. But he does not oppose, at least in the short term, other fossil fuel use \u2014 and that\u2019s not good enough for activists like Mitch Jones, who directs climate and energy programs for Food & Water Action, an environmental group that fights corporate influences in the movement.\n\n\u201cBloomberg\u2019s reputation as a climate warrior is a bit overblown,\u201d Jones told The Associated Press , calling him \u201ca pro-fracking, pro-pipeline, pro-nuclear billionaire who favors half measures and false solutions because he\u2019s more interested in protecting his friends in the C Suite than he is in stopping climate change.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s giving covers five major areas \u2014 the environment, public health, government innovation, the arts and education \u2014 and last year totaled $787 million, making him the nation\u2019s second-most generous philanthropist behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nThrough one of his biggest programs, the American Cities Initiative , Bloomberg has helped municipalities and activists grapple with everything from climate change to guns to obesity. The initiative is an outgrowth of Bloomberg\u2019s time as New York mayor and has helped sow goodwill with mayors and former mayors throughout the country, giving him possible entr\u00e9e into a layer of local political support that conventional candidates lack.\n\nMichael Nutter, who served as Philadelphia\u2019s mayor when Bloomberg was New York mayor, said Bloomberg is a master of \u201cG.S.D.\"\n\n\"In private, that means getting shit done,\" he said. \"In public, that means getting stuff done.\u201d\n\nNutter, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, said he\u2019s behind Bloomberg, whom he calls \u201cmayor of the world.\u201d\n\nIn the signature city of yet another swing state \u2014 Miami \u2014 former Mayor Manny Diaz sits on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies and last week introduced Bloomberg at a fundraiser for immigrants' rights where he said the country needs Bloomberg for president.

In a speech accepting El Paso Inc.\u2019s \u201cEl Pasoan of the Year\u201d award, he said that on issues ranging from climate change to immigration, \u201cEl Paso is the answer.\u201d\n\nThe call and response laid bare the durability of an issue that defined the 2016 presidential race \u2014 and is shaping the earliest stages of the 2020 campaign.\n\nTrump\u2019s and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s jabs came a week after the president appeared in El Paso to redouble his call for building a border wall, hosting a campaign-style rally that O\u2019Rourke met with a massive march and protest. O\u2019Rourke said Tuesday that while Trump \u201cturned the focus of this country to the United States-Mexico border, \u2026 we stood up, not against him necessarily, but we stood up for ourselves.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

He has placed Trump\u2019s call for border wall funding at the center of his likely campaign, arguing that walls are not only ineffective at reducing crime \u2014 a point supported by statistics in El Paso \u2014 but also that they endanger immigrants by encouraging them to cross the border in more remote locations.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need another wall. We don\u2019t need another fence,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in Chicago. \u201cWalls do not, as the president has claimed, save lives. Walls end lives.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, O\u2019Rourke has outlined proposals for extending citizenship to undocumented people known as Dreamers \u2014 who were brought the country illegally as children \u2014 and offering a path to citizenship for other undocumented immigrants. And his remark on MSNBC that he would remove existing barriers in El Paso forced other Democrats to respond.\n\nAsked about O'Rourke\u2019s statement on Friday, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York told Fox News, \u201cI\u2019d have to ask folks in that part of the country to see whether the fencing that exists today is helpful or unhelpful.\u201d But, she added, \u201cI could look at it and see which part he means and why, and if it makes sense, I could support it.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, O\u2019Rourke expanded on his remarks to MSNBC, telling reporters that \u201cthere is a role for physical barriers in some places\u201d and that he would not necessarily remove border fencing in areas outside El Paso.\n\n\u201cI would work with local stakeholders, the property owners, the communities, those who actually live there to determine the best security solution,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe saw in El Paso a solution in search of a problem imposed on us by people who did not live here.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats confronting a looming general election campaign against Trump, the politics of immigration are fraught. A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll last week suggested that the American electorate is split on the construction of a border wall, while earlier polls indicated that the subject resonates more strongly with Republicans than Democrats. Even in El Paso, some supporters fret about O\u2019Rourke focusing so heavily on a subject that Trump used to win election in 2016.\n\n\u201cI worry about the general election politics,\u201d Hector Gutierrez Jr., an El Paso-based public affairs consultant, said. \u201cBut I admire the fact he\u2019s willing to take a stand.\u201d\n\nCelinda Lake, a leading Democratic pollster and strategist, said immigration \u201cfits Beto\u2019s brand\u201d and \u201che\u2019s kind of in a unique position on this, having been a congressman from that area.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the major reason that so many people are engaging on immigration is because it is a seminal contrast with Donald Trump,\u201d Lake said. \u201cAnd right now, Democrats want to go beat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFrank Luntz, a veteran Republican consultant and pollster, wrote in an email that \u201cit makes perfect sense for the Democratic candidates to focus on immigration, not because they are anti-wall but because it allows them to be anti-Trump.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m surprised none of them have come up with a chant like \u2018scrap the wall\u2019 for their supporters.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s attention to immigration comes even as other Democratic contenders refocus on health care, childcare and taxes \u2014 and as O\u2019Rourke asserts more centrist elements of his profile.

He used the six-minute segment to pitch himself as an experienced businessman who could cut through the U.N. bureaucracy to deliver meaningful reforms, and also as someone who is willing to communicate the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision.

But two White House officials said Grenell, despite earning the president\u2019s praise, is unlikely to land the job. The openly gay Trump administration official was just tapped to lead a global initiative against the criminalization of homosexuality in dozens of developed countries, NBC reported on Tuesday.\n\nJames, who lost a race to unseat Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow last November, has long been discussed in GOP circles as a rising star in the Republican Party.

Senate Democrats reacted with almost uniform dismay to Nauert\u2019s nomination last year, claiming her loyalty to Trump should not supersede qualifications.\n\nJames would likely face similar pushback if nominated, even if some foreign policy experts insist that expertise in their field is not an absolute determiner of who can represent the U.S. well at the powerful international organization.\n\n\u201cNikki Haley had very little foreign policy credentials before she did it and she did a great job,\u201d said James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cShe was \u2026 a quick learner and she was a strong leader, and those were the most valuable credentials.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one difference,\u201d Carafano allowed, \u201cis Haley had a lot of time in government.

Many current and former Trump White House officials are convinced there will be turnover at the top as the 2020 campaign intensifies. There's also widespread concern tensions will flare between the campaign and the administration if either side is perceived as making a mistake.\n\nYet the new organization is intended to clarify the decision-making structure. And squarely at the top of that chain is Parscale. Each of the 10 department heads will report to the 43-year-old campaign manager, and he will serve as the main point person for Trump and his family.\n\nThe Trump campaign named three new department chiefs on Tuesday. White House aide Cole Blocker will serve as finance director, Agriculture Department official Tim Murtaugh as communications director, and Marc Lotter, a former Pence adviser, as director of surrogates.\n\nTen senior staffers are expected to take up residence in the campaign\u2019s 21,000 square-foot Rosslyn, Virginia, headquarters by the end of the month. In total, the campaign expects to have nearly 100 people on payroll by the end of the year.\n\nParscale has quietly been conducting interviews since late last year and has reached out to an array of senior Republicans.\n\nWhile the organization\u2019s tight structure is reminiscent of past presidential reelection bids, Trump aides say the campaign will be non-traditional in some ways. They point out that two digital strategists, Parscale and Gary Coby, have been tapped for senior roles \u2013 an indication that digital and data will form the nucleus of the campaign.\n\nTwo other top campaign aides, meanwhile, have launched an unprecedented effort to stave off mayhem at the GOP convention and to ensure that its a smooth running pro-Trump infomercial. Another top official, Chris Carr, is overseeing a field deployment plan that, for the first time, is being run in conjunction with the RNC.\n\nAnd in another break from precedent, the campaign, with the RNC, is planning an early and aggressive effort to brand the Democratic field as being out-of-the mainstream and socialist. The offensive is expected to be spearheaded by a handful of communications staffers working out of the Rosslyn headquarters, with assistance from others stationed in swing states.\n\nAt the campaign\u2019s request, the RNC has begun funding video tracking efforts of Democrats while they campaign in early primary states.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re an incumbent,\u201d said McLaughlin. \u201cBut he\u2019s really still a nontraditional president.\u201d\n\n"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/jeff-rosen-deputy-attorney-general-1188450", "text": "Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeff Rosen is an experienced attorney with a deep resume. | Department of Transportation via AP Justice Department DOT\u2019s Rosen tapped as deputy attorney general\n\nDeputy Transportation Secretary Jeff Rosen will be nominated as the next deputy attorney general, ending his stint as the second-in-command at the Transportation Department.\n\nThe White House announced his nomination, which has been rumored for weeks, on Tuesday evening.

Roger probably needs to be slapped on the wrist,\u201d said Tyler Nixon, a longtime friend and counsel to Stone.\n\nStone, whose barbed commentary has been tied to fundraising pleas, is \u201clearning the contours of what he can get away with saying and legitimately raise money for his defense and frankly protest what he legitimately believes to be a miscarriage of justice in his prosecution,\u201d Nixon said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fine line and I\u2019d hope the judge will enable him to make the couple mistakes and take it seriously,\u201d he added.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear Jackson will give Stone any more chances.\n\nJackson, an appointee of President Barack Obama, has earned a no-nonsense reputation in the Mueller probe cases she has overseen, including charges against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s campaign deputy. In that case, she slapped a gag order on Manafort and Gates, as well as their attorneys, just days after Mueller\u2019s initial indictments were filled. She later sent Manafort to jail after the special counsel accused him of witness tampering \u2014 that\u2019s where the 69-year old longtime GOP operative has remained ever since.\n\nThe judge has a wide latitude in terms of how to deal with Stone. Jackson can give him a stern warning or impose the same kind of restrictive gag order that she issued Friday for Mueller's and Stone\u2019s lawyers \u2014 but not for Stone himself \u2014 and potential case witnesses. She also could impose restrictions on Stone like requiring him to wear a GPS monitoring device or limiting his travel \u2014 Jackson already has set parameters that require him to get the court\u2019s permission to venture beyond South Florida, New York or the D.C. region. A fine or jail aren\u2019t out of the question either.\n\n\u201cThe gag order may be the lesser of his eventual problems if it turns out that when they investigate his conduct the prosecutors could decide that that constitutes an effort to intimidate or threaten the judge,\u201d said Shanlon Wu, a defense attorney who previously represented Gates.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals Service said the department responsible for protecting federal judges is aware of the threat Stone allegedly made against Jackson. But it declined to discuss any specific threats or how it protects judges.\n\nEven before his Instagram post, Stone was shaping up to be anything but a conventional defendant. He\u2019s spent the weeks since his indictment last month going on national television and doing interviews from his South Florida driveway. In court, his lawyers have filed motions objecting to Jackson\u2019s assignment to their case and accusing Mueller of releasing Stone\u2019s indictment before it had secured court approval.\n\nStone\u2019s legal strategy, his friends and allies say, was born after observing Manafort\u2019s legal strategy.\n\n\u201cRoger watched other people defend themselves quietly and lose,\u201d said Michael Caputo, a former Trump 2016 campaign adviser and longtime Stone friend who has been questioned in the Mueller investigation. \u201cHe\u2019s made the conscious decision to speak loudly and clearly about his innocence throughout the entire process.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s team indicted Stone late last month on charges of lying, obstruction of justice and witness tampering \u2014 crimes that could get him more than four years in prison if he is convicted. Preparing for trial, the special counsel\u2019s prosecutors had sought a gag order on Stone out of fear his comments would affect the fairness of a trial.\n\nStone\u2019s latest predicament is of his own making. The image of Jackson posted on Instagram on Monday seemed to feature crosshairs in the corner. Others noted that the picture came from a conspiracy theory website that has an anti-Jewish perspective.\n\nHe later deleted the photo and posted a version without crosshairs. By the end of the evening, though, Stone had deleted that photo, as well, and his lawyers submitted an apology to the court.\n\n\u201cPlease inform the Court that the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted,\u201d Stone wrote in Monday night\u2019s court filing. \u201cI had no intention of disrespecting the Court and humbly apologize to the court for the transgression.\u201d\n\nIn an email to POLITICO, Stone said he would attend Thursday\u2019s hearing as ordered.\n\n\u201cI have no further comment at this time,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOne of Stone\u2019s lawyers, Bruce Rogow, said he\u2019d also be in attendance Thursday but did not answer a question about a potential shakeup on Stone\u2019s legal team in the wake of Monday\u2019s incident. Two other Stone attorneys didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, though both are restricted from speaking about the case under the gag order.\n\nIn interviews on Tuesday, Stone\u2019s friends chalked up the Instagram post to a mistake that\u2019s been widely misinterpreted by the media as an attack on the judge. They say Stone was trying to get across that Jackson was appointed by Obama.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he wanted to get across. But it can certainly be interpreted differently,\u201d said Annemarie McAvoy, another attorney who was on Gates' defense team. \u201cThat\u2019s why as an attorney you want the client to only speak through you or with close supervision.\u201d\n\nStone needs to come to terms with the fact his every move is being scrutinized and could be used against him, Nixon said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to defend what was put up. My advice is not to have done that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an adjustment period Roger is having to get used to.\u201d\n\nWu, a former federal prosecutor, predicted Stone would eventually recognize the legal peril he faces by excessively commenting on his own case. \u201cHe might kick and fuss a little bit in the beginning but once he gets a whiff of reality he\u2019s going to cave,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to show himself to be some sort of warrior for a First Amendment cause.\u201d\n\nOthers doubt whether Stone would ever take his lawyers\u2019 advice and stop discussing the case. McAvoy said Jackson\u2019s initial ruling Friday set up Stone for the legal morass he\u2019s now in.\n\n\u201cShe gave him just enough rope to get himself into trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s capable of keeping his mouth shut. It\u2019s just not in his personality and it\u2019s very hard to force someone to change his personality.\u201d\n\nJackson on Friday signaled she\u2019d be keeping close tabs on Stone, noting that while her initial order allowed him to keep talking about the case, she retained the power to amend her order \u201cif necessary.\u201d She also warned Stone that any excessive public comments could come back to bite him if he complained later on about excessive pretrial publicity that he himself caused.\n\nIn the longer term, McAvoy said Stone should be mindful that has publicly targeted the judge who would be sentencing him if he ends up pleading guilty or a jury convicts him on Mueller\u2019s charges.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to forget that,\u201d McAvoy said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between an aggressive defense and upsetting the judge to the extent that you then have payback from the judge during sentencing.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/18/roger-stone-instagram-crosshairs-1173600", "text": "\u201cWhat some say are crosshairs are in fact the logo of the organization that originally posted it something called corruption central.

Circuit ruling remains the subject of active debate in legal circles, but a judicial opinion raising doubts about Mueller could be particularly welcome in Trump\u2019s camp as it braces for a potential release containing some of Mueller\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cOn occasion when a case takes longer, it tends to show there are disparate opinions. That could mean there\u2019s a dissent, but it might not be,\u201d said Enrique Armijo, a law professor at Elon University in North Carolina and a former D.C. Circuit law clerk. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s taking a longer time, if I had to lay down money, I\u2019d say there could be multiple opinions.\u201d\n\nThe challenge the D.C. Circuit panel is wrestling with was brought by Andrew Miller, a former assistant to the longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone. Arguing that Mueller was illegally appointed, Miller fought a subpoena to appear before a grand jury in Washington. After losing in front of a district court judge, attorney Paul Kamenar took Miller\u2019s case to the appeals court, which heard arguments in November.\n\nKeep up with POLITICO Playbook The 2020 Election.

As the fight with Miller unfolded last year, however, no indictment of Stone emerged.\n\nStone was finally indicted last month, about 10 weeks after Miller\u2019s appeal was argued.\n\nA few days later, Kamenar turned up at the federal courthouse in Washington, chatting with journalists about the Mueller challenge he brought that has dropped from the headlines.\n\nStone\u2019s indictment prompted Kamenar to ask prosecutors whether Miller\u2019s testimony was still needed. He said they replied with a one-line email saying the grand jury still wanted to hear from his client.\n\nFederal court rulings and Justice Department policy say grand juries should be used to investigate only potential future charges, not past ones. That prosecutors are still pressing for Miller\u2019s testimony suggests further charges against Stone or one of his associates, Kamenar said.\n\nMeasured against a typical D.C. Circuit case, the pace of the Miller appeal is not particularly sluggish. The median wait for a decision in a case argued at the D.C. Circuit is 3.1 months, according to data released last year by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n\nHowever, the court typically treats grand jury cases with greater urgency than other disputes, since the lack of testimony or records from a particular witness can sometimes impair an ongoing investigation. And the court initially seemed intent on moving the Miller case along quickly.\n\nAn expedited briefing schedule was set just two days after the appeal was docketed last August. The Nov. 8 argument date also vaulted the case ahead of many others pending at the court.\n\n\u201cThat seems to imply that they viewed the issue to have some urgency,\u201d said Armijo, the Elon law professor.\n\nIn recent months, Miller\u2019s challenge has been eclipsed by another, more mysterious grand jury fight involving the special counsel: a showdown with a foreign-government-owned company refusing to turn over information demanded by a jury working with Mueller\u2019s prosecutors.\n\nThat dispute quickly sprinted past the Miller case, both in terms of timing and public attention after POLITICO first reported on the mystery battle last October.\n\nThe grand jury appeal involving Mueller and the foreign firm was argued in secret at the D.C. Circuit on Dec. 14, with an initial ruling from the three-judge panel emerging just four days later. A more detailed 23-page opinion and a five-page concurrence were released last month, less than four weeks after the case was argued.\n\nThe still-unidentified firm prolonged the battle by taking the issue to the Supreme Court, where Chief Justice John Roberts briefly issued a stay, which was dissolved when the full court declined to take action. The company\u2019s request to add the case to the high court\u2019s docket is still pending.\n\nKamenar said he saw a \u201cstark contrast\u201d between the D.C. Circuit\u2019s rapid-fire handling of the firm\u2019s case and the more drawn-out pace in his one. \u201cI expect a decision any day now,\u201d he added.\n\nThe legal issues involved in the foreign company\u2019s fight are more narrow than those raised by Miller\u2019s appeal, which challenges both the constitutionality of Mueller\u2019s directing the investigation without Senate confirmation and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s power to name a special counsel.\n\nFormer prosecutors said they remained doubtful that Mueller would suffer an outright defeat in the Miller case, but they said the passage of time suggested some trouble for the special counsel.\n\n\u201cI suspect if they were going to cut Mueller off at the knees, as it were, they would\u2019ve done so promptly,\u201d said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney in Detroit.\n\nThe panel considering the challenge to Mueller\u2019s appointment consists of two Democratic-appointed judges and one Republican appointee: Judith Rogers, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton; Sri Srinivasan, an appointee of President Barack Obama; and Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was appointed by President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cI wonder if Judge Henderson is battling the others. Otherwise, I don\u2019t get the delay,\u201d McQuade said.\n\nClearly, Trump would embrace any judicial suggestion \u2014 even a dissent \u2014 suggesting that Mueller\u2019s investigation was flawed from the outset.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller investigation is totally conflicted, illegal and rigged!\u201d the president wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cShould never have been allowed to begin, except for the Collusion and many crimes committed by the Democrats. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nLast May, a judge handling one of Mueller\u2019s cases against Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, publicly challenged Mueller\u2019s tactics, saying the prosecution had nothing to do with Mueller\u2019s mandate to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis also questioned whether Mueller was asserting \u201cunfettered power\u201d to pursue any case he wished.\n\nTrump was so thrilled at Ellis\u2019 critique that he read a news account about it aloud at a speech in Texas to thousands of National Rifle Association members. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying that for a long time,\u201d Trump said, praising the judge as \u201creally something special.\u201d\n\nThe following month, however, Ellis rejected Manafort\u2019s legal arguments against the special counsel. The judge called aspects of Mueller\u2019s approach \u201cdistasteful,\u201d but said that it was common practice by prosecutors and no reason to dismiss the case against Manafort, who was later convicted by a jury on eight felony charges, including tax and bank fraud.\n\nDespite speculation that Henderson might part with her colleagues, Armijo \u2014 who clerked for her \u2014 said it would be a mistake to predict a dissent from her solely based on her Republican ties.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a terribly partisan person at all with respect to her decisions from the bench,\u201d the professor said. \u201cI have no doubt that if she\u2019s writing separately she\u2019s being very careful about what she would say.\u201d\n\nDarren Samuelsohn contributed to this report."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/congress-data-privacy-california-1185943", "text": "\u201cCalifornia\u2019s bill is the best.

It allows the state to fine companies for violations and, under certain circumstances, lets individual Californians sue companies for failing to keep their data secure. The law doesn't go into effect until 2020, but it already has the backing of many Democratic lawmakers at the federal level, particularly those from the California delegation.\n\nThat could be a problem for nascent efforts to pass a federal privacy bill \u2014 a goal that members of both parties have set for this year. In fact, the California law's 2020 effective date amounts to a natural deadline for GOP lawmakers to quash state-level privacy protections.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nDemocrats have been critical of any proposal to override state privacy laws since talk of a federal law began in earnest last year. Some lawmakers, like Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), have indicated that their opposition to state-law preemption could be a bargaining chip \u2014 they might accede to it if Republicans agree to beef up the Federal Trade Commission's enforcement powers.\n\nLately, however, California Democrats have been firmer in their outright opposition to crafting any federal law that either overrides or does anything short of replicating, and possibly expanding upon, their state's law. That push threatens to disrupt otherwise bipartisan and broadly supported talks that have gained urgency amid a barrage of data scandals in Silicon Valley.\n\nSeveral California Democrats, including key Silicon Valley representatives like Ro Khanna and Anna Eshoo and Tony C\u00e1rdenas of San Fernando Valley, told POLITICO that the state\u2019s rules should form the floor for any federal effort.\n\n\u201cIt is a concern among the Californians. There is no question about it,\u201d Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce consumer protection subcommittee, said of the GOP push to preempt state measures like California\u2019s.\n\nAnd Schakowsky said the delegation is not alone in its skepticism of preemption efforts, which come as several other states weigh their own data privacy proposals. \u201cI am generally against preemption because it\u2019s really often an excuse to water down whatever states are doing,\u201d she said.\n\nRep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), who chairs the full committee, was also critical of preemption. \u201cI always prefer not to,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), as a member of the delegation, could be another factor to watch. Although a spokesman confirms she \u201cwants a privacy bill that will put consumers nationwide back in control of their information,\u201d the aide cautioned against diminishing any state authority: \u201cStates have been at the vanguard of protecting Americans. All Americans have benefited from state privacy and data breach laws, so their role as policy innovator and law enforcer must be respected.\u201d\n\nMembers of both parties acknowledged that the preemption question is among the thorniest under discussion in legislative talks, which have already stalled relative to optimistic early projections. Senate negotiators had hoped to unveil a data privacy draft bill early in 2019, but week after week has slipped by without any release. The negotiators now say it\u2019s unlikely a draft emerges by the end of February, when both Senate and House panels will hold their first hearings on the topic.\n\nThe negotiations could prove far messier if California\u2019s Democratic representatives buck any deal to override the California law. Most negotiators closest to these efforts do not represent California, and lawmakers like Speier and some others may be reluctant to accept any emerging deal, potentially resetting talks just as consensus seems to be emerging.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always concerned about the California Democrats,\u201d said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), a lead Senate negotiator participating in a bipartisan working group on privacy. Moran is one of several Republican lawmakers to voice support for efforts to override state laws like California\u2019s. \u201cYou have to have national preemption,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Republicans who will have to negotiate a deal on privacy, including House E&C committee and consumer protection subcommittee ranking members Greg Walden of Oregon and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, said they view national overriding standards as important. At stake, they said, is regulatory certainty for a wide swath of companies. Republicans argue that the internet transcends state borders and thus merits a national set of privacy safeguards.\n\nWalden, acknowledging pressure from California\u2019s delegation on preemption, said he doesn\u2019t blame the lawmakers for their position. \u201cThey want to rightly defend their law,\u201d he said in an interview. And while he said Congress should \u201cbuild off\u201d what California has done, he suggested the law was rushed and problematic and would create a problem for industry if implemented.\n\nDemocratic leaders both inside and outside California, meanwhile, are facing pressure from advocacy groups and state leaders to protect the state\u2019s sweeping privacy safeguards.\n\nAlastair Mactaggart, who launched a California ballot initiative that paved the way for the state\u2019s privacy law, has met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill in recent weeks to lobby on privacy. He told POLITICO he plans to ramp up outreach efforts to California lawmakers to urge them not to preempt the state law with a weaker national statute.\n\n\u201cI do want to start making efforts to try to get people to contact their representatives and say, \u2018Hey, look: You, California, absolutely decide the fate of this thing,\u2019\u201d he said during an interview. And within California, there's bipartisan interest in protecting the law. Earlier this week a group of Republican state lawmakers from California urged Capitol Hill committee leaders not to preempt state laws.\n\nThe next several months will test how much sway California and the federal lawmakers representing the state may hold on the Democratic caucus writ large. As some members, from Pallone to Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), seem wary of a preemption provision generally, California\u2019s influence could tip the scales on what sort of bill they would be willing to support \u2014 and whether Republicans and Democrats eventually land on the same page.\n\n\u201cPreemption\u2019s always been a tough issue, particularly [when] the federal government hasn\u2019t done anything and some states have provided leadership like California,\u201d said Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), an E&C panel member who has entertained a bargain involving preemption. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of respect for what California has done and how it\u2019s taken the lead.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/canada-prescription-drugs-1188578", "text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration strongly discourages importing drugs even for personal use, saying it can't ensure they are safe. | Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images canada Canadian shelves \u2018would run dry\u2019 if U.S. imports drugs The president is joining liberals like Bernie Sanders in pushing to legalize pharmaceutical imports from Canada.\n\nImporting prescription drugs from Canada has long been seen as an easy solution to skyrocketing drug prices for U.S. patients.\n\nBut now that President Donald Trump and Democrats are pushing to make those cross-border sales legal, Canadian health experts are issuing a dire warning: It could destroy Canada's drug market.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAttempting to fill the United States' needs with pharmaceuticals from its much smaller northern neighbor could sap supplies in Canada, creating shortages and driving up prices in a government-run health system that itself is struggling to make drugs affordable, opponents of the import proposals say.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nBut the idea is gaining momentum, as evidenced by five bills in Congress \u2014 including one promoted by presidential contender Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 while states like Vermont are barreling ahead with their own plans.\n\nSanders, a long-time champion of importation, has the most far-reaching plan, S. 97, which would allow wholesalers and licensed pharmacies to buy from FDA-approved counterparts in Canada. He argues that Canada\u2019s fears are unfounded.\n\n\u201cFor years the pharmaceutical industry has tried to scare Canadian officials into thinking that U.S. importers would drain the drug supply in Canada,\u201d a Sanders spokesperson said. The bill attempts to head off such a scenario by barring drug companies from retaliating against Canadian pharmacies that sell medicines to U.S. buyers at lower Canadian prices. Identical language is in companion legislation by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who has launched drug pricing hearings this year as chairman of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline and other big manufacturers have threatened such penalties in the past after internet pharmacies shipped cheaper medicines across the border. Some of those pharmacies scaled back after being forced to report shipment details while others struck deals with storefront pharmacies to avoid scrutiny.\n\nBut clamping down on drugmaker retaliation won't address all the possible consequences of widespread imports. Even if pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t pull their stock, it\u2019s far more likely that Canadian prices will jump with the boosted demand while U.S. prices remain largely unchanged, said former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan, who is now director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy.\n\nEven narrower proposals to allow American consumers to personally import drugs \u2014 such as S. 61 and H.R. 478 by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) \u2014 would have to overcome hurdles. Canadian pharmacists can\u2019t accept American prescriptions, meaning patients would need to line up a Canadian doctor to co-sign their prescriptions \u2014 which is not an accepted practice up north, said Joelle Walker, director of public affairs for the Canadian Pharmacists Association.\n\n\u201cEven if the legislation did pass for Americans, it\u2019s not going to be as simple as going through Canadian pharmacies,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd I assume it\u2019s not inexpensive to get a Canadian physician to see you and sign a prescription.\u201d\n\nWhat the extra requirement could do is drive business to online pharmacies \u2014 a fast-growing market that both Canadian and American regulators have criticized as a potential conduit for counterfeit or ineffective medicines, as well as shipments of illicit prescription painkillers.\n\nThe Canadian government so far has held its fire, perhaps because none of the bills are likely to pass soon. It's instead focused on a variety of price-lowering initiatives, with a national election coming this fall. One such plan would change the formulas used to set domestic prices through the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which has only partial power over the cost of medicines and can't dictate the cost of generic drugs or what wholesalers and pharmacies pay for products. Partly for this reason, Canadians pay more for drugs than Europeans in government-run systems.\n\nSanders' staff has discussed his plan with the Canadian embassy and consulted with experts on the country\u2019s drug system. But Walker said it's hard to imagine Canadian lawmakers and regulators are pleased with such ideas. Besides the Canadian Pharmacists Association, which has come out against U.S. import proposals in the past, Canadian patient advocacy groups and providers would need to sign off. And on top of federal regulators in Ottawa, Canada has regional pharmacy boards \u2014 known as provincial colleges \u2014 that ultimately issue guidance and standards for pharmacists in the various provinces.\n\nThe bureaucratic and legal landscape isn't much friendlier in the United States. A federal judge already struck down Maine\u2019s attempt at letting citizens buy their own drugs across the border. Vermont\u2019s similar plan, passed last year but yet to take effect, has to pass muster with the Department of Health and Human Services, where Secretary Alex Azar has frequently criticized even limited personal imports as potentially undermining strong U.S. safety standards.\n\nEven when HHS announced a working group last year to explore importing certain drugs, Azar and FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stressed its narrow goals \u2014 saying the group would explore bringing in a medication only when it had a single U.S. manufacturer and evidence existed of supply problems or price gouging.\n\nIt comes down to FDA's limited capacity to oversee imports, said former commissioner McClellan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that has come up over and over again \u2014 FDA\u2019s inability to ensure the safety and effectiveness of a[n imported] drug,\u201d he said. Even doing that in narrow circumstances would require scaling up the agency\u2019s resources and gaining access to each step of the supply chain.\n\nMorgan said U.S. policymakers should be focused on fixing the broader health system instead of buying drugs from Canada.\n\n\u201cWhy bother to import medicines from the country with the second-highest prices in the world? That is Canada. We\u2019re second only to the United States in drug prices,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Americans are paying too much for drugs, says Amir Attaran, a health-law specialist at the University of Ottawa who\u2019s closely watching U.S. lawmakers\u2019 efforts. \u201cBut ... tapping out your neighbor is a nasty, rotten thing to do.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/20/unc-race-admissions-1162175", "text": "The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower at UNC Chapel Hill.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe frank back-and-forth among unidentified UNC staffers, dating from 2014, is part of a slew of chats and emails figuring in a lawsuit over how UNC considers race in admissions. Roughly a third of U.S. universities consider the race of applicants when they reach decisions about which students receive highly coveted acceptance letters and which are denied.\n\nThe five-year-old legal fight comes at the same time that debates over race, privilege and discrimination are roiling higher education and the nation, most recently over whether Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam used blackface while in medical school. The North Carolina case is one of two over affirmative action that potentially could reach the Supreme Court.\n\nColleges have argued it\u2019s imperative they enroll a diverse student body, in part because of incidents like in Virginia. The Supreme Court, which has repeatedly approved the use of race in admitting college students, has agreed\u2014 noting that creating a diverse student body \u201cpromotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables students to better understand persons of different races.\u201d\n\nBut the group suing UNC, Students For Fair Admissions, contends the chats and emails show that UNC has gone too far.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions alleges that UNC admissions officials closely monitor the racial makeup of an incoming class, which SFFA has said is tantamount to racial balancing. And it claims that non-minority UNC students have \"far stronger academic qualifications\" than minority students, that UNC \"gives substantial preferences\" to minorities and that UNC \"uses race in a mechanical, formulaic way.\"\n\n\"Readers are keenly focused on the applicant\u2019s race,\u201d attorneys for SFFA wrote in court filings. The suit has not yet gone to trial, and the latest step was a filing of motions for summary judgment last month.\n\nUNC Vice Provost for Enrollment and Undergraduate Admissions Steve Farmer said in a statement that the online exchanges don\u2019t \u201creflect Carolina\u2019s values or our admissions process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only consider race or ethnicity as one of a multitude of factors, if a student chooses to share that information on the standard Common Application, as is consistent with the law,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cOur admissions staff receive rigorous training on how to read and discuss applications and follow written guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe university noted that the conversations cited in the suit were \u201ccherry picked from the 380,000 pages of documents and information about 200,000 applicants that we provided.\u201d\n\nUNC's attorneys say the school has \"closely adhered\" to Supreme Court precedent, including considering race in admissions in a narrowly tailored manner. They say the lawsuit is just one of the group\u2019s \"attempts to rewrite the law and dictate University policy.\" SFFA wants the court to \"impose a new constitutional standard\" on UNC, the lawyers say.\n\nSFFA is also suing Harvard University, in a closely watched challenge to the Ivy League school\u2019s admissions policies, which SFFA contends discriminate against Asian-American applicants.\n\nSFFA is led by Edward Blum, a longtime opponent of affirmative action who was also the architect of a legal challenge against the University of Texas at Austin. The case ended up before the Supreme Court, which sided with UT Austin.\n\nWith President Donald Trump constructing a more conservative high court, the Harvard case is widely believed to be the next best shot at ending affirmative action. But the UNC case is waiting in the wings should that effort fail.\n\nIn the chats and emails included as evidence, which mostly appear to be from the early stages of an admissions process, UNC officials often referred to applicants\u2019 race, and experts say that's not unusual.\n\n\u201cA lot of what happens during the reading and review process is, there is kind of a give-and-take \u2014 horse trading, as you will \u2014 to talk about applicants as they relate to other applicants, as they relate to admissions criteria,\u201d said David Hawkins, executive director for educational content and policy at the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\nHe said language in the 2014 chats isn\u2019t \u201cideal,\u201d but they seem like early conversations about applicants, and don\u2019t seem to indicate any final decisions \u2014 so it\u2019s impossible to tell how much race actually ended up mattering. These readers are only making recommendations that will later be considered by other admissions officials and a full committee.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s likely to be a much deeper conversation about how the student fits in at all and whether they can succeed,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nStill, for schools that consider race in admissions \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be uncommon to talk about an applicant as a brown student or a Native American student or a white student.\u201d\n\nUNC staffers in the chats, along with race, also touted applicants\u2019 academic credentials \u2014 perfect SAT scores and high marks on Advanced Placement tests \u2014 and stress how much hardship the applicants have overcome.\n\nOne applicant, they wrote, \u201cworks 35 hours/week,\u201d was a first generation college student and an underrepresented minority. \u201cSingle mom, unemployed,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn some cases, officials questioned whether other readers were fairly considering an applicant\u2019s full background \u2014 whether they attended a school that didn\u2019t offer as many advanced courses or extracurricular opportunities as other applicants, for instance, but did as much as they could.\n\nIn December 2015, one admissions official wrote to another that some other readers \u201care missing the school context.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re penalizing students for modest programs but missing the fact that the school only offers a few APs, so in context, the student is actually exhausting or nearly exhausting the rigor that\u2019s available to them,\u201d they wrote.\n\nUNC attorneys stressed in court filings that the university doesn\u2019t have racial quotas and readers are never given targets or numerical goals for shaping the incoming class. Caroline Hoxby, an economist UNC hired to study admissions data for the case, concluded race explains very little of UNC\u2019s admissions decisions \u2014 between 0.8 and 5.6 percent, depending on the model.\n\nBut the chat messages and emails show how race comes up.\n\nIn a March 2014 email, an admissions official wrote another colleague asking whether an applicant who lived in North Carolina with his mother, but whose father lived in Texas, might be considered an in-state applicant, even though he marked on his application that he was not a North Carolina resident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going through this trouble because this is a bi-racial (black/white) male,\u201d the official wrote. \u201cI would definitely admit for NC.\u201d\n\nIn May, an academic adviser in the university\u2019s College of Arts & Science wrote two admissions officials about an applicant.\n\n\u201cWe know this is late admission but we would like to see [REDACTED] have a shot,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe is an Hispanic minority and good background to have this opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn November 2013, one official wrote to another with questions about \u201can AA female, with solid everything that adds up to an admit for me.\u201d\n\nIn the 2014 chat exchange where admissions officials wrote about giving \u201cbrown babies a shot at these merit $$,\u201d one official wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t think I can admit or defer this brown girl \u2026 Testing, ECs and performance are too low for me to even make an argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. gotta let her go,\u201d another replied.\n\nIn another exchange, one official wrote about an applicant with \u201cperfect 2400 SAT All 5 on AP one B in 11th.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrown?!\u201d another responded.\n\n\u201cHeck no,\u201d the first wrote back. \u201cAsian.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the other wrote. \u201cStill impressive.\"\n\nOverall, the conversations show a \u201cracial awareness\u201d in UNC's admissions office, said Liliana Garces, an associate professor of education at the University of Texas at Austin and an affiliate faculty member at UT\u2019s School of Law.\n\n\u201cThat to me is necessary in order to make an informed decision that\u2019s really considering all the various factors that make up an applicant,\u201d said Garces, who was the counsel of record in an amicus brief filed on behalf of hundreds of social scientists supporting UT Austin when the Supreme Court considered its use of race in admissions in 2016.\n\n\u201cBecause of how it matters in our society in that very structural way, it can shape our experiences, our life chances, the ways in which, the opportunities you have before you,\u201d Garces said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to matter, but it does for a lot of students.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/besty-devos-investigation-1186521", "text": "Mick Zais, the deputy secretary of education, asked the Inspector General's office to \u201creconsider any plan that it might have to review\u201d the Trump administration\u2019s move to reinstate the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. | Jeffrey Collins/AP Photo education Democrats contend DeVos deputy interfered with inspector general probe\n\nCongressional Democrats said Tuesday they have uncovered evidence that the Trump administration tried to influence an internal watchdog's investigation of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\nFive top House and Senate Democrats said that the Trump administration sought to remove the Education Department\u2019s acting inspector general last month after she pushed back on a request to \u201creconsider\u201d her investigation into DeVos\u2019 move to reinstate a controversial accreditor of for-profit colleges.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Democrats, who sit on committees with oversight of the department, said that a January letter from a top DeVos deputy to Sandra Bruce, the acting inspector general, about the inquiry amounted to a \u201cclear attempt to violate the statutory independence\u201d of the agency\u2019s inspector general.\n\nPOLITICO reported that President Donald Trump in late January abruptly appointed Phil Rosenfelt, the department\u2019s deputy general counsel, to replace Bruce as the department\u2019s acting IG.

He wrote that it was \u201cdisturbing that your office appears to be responding to a Congressional request that is really a disagreement over policy and the merits of the Department\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nZais also wrote that it was the Obama administration that should be investigated in connection with ACICS.

Instead of droning along in her trademark monotone as she usually does, speaking without really saying anything, Merkel seemed to take a page from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s playbook: She was lively, combative and, above all, honest about how she sees the world.\n\nLost in the euphoria over the chancellor\u2019s rhetorical awakening was that the speech marked another first for Merkel: an admission of failure, even if it was only an implicit one.\n\nDuring her half-hour tour de force, Merkel unwittingly presented a chronological autopsy of her foreign policy that underscored the degree to which Germany has been a not-so-innocent bystander in crisis after crisis during the 13 years of her tenure. By ignoring festering problems, she has allowed them to morph into catastrophes.\n\nWhere Berlin did act, its prescriptions often made matters worse.\n\n\u201cGerman voices are simply absent from the big debates of our time\" \u2014 Julianne Smith, former U.S. national security official\n\nTake Greece, which Merkel mentioned in passing as one of her greatest challenges. Berlin\u2019s insistence that Athens undertake draconian spending cuts in return for bailout cash deepened Greece\u2019s economic crisis and destabilized its political system, making the \u201crescue\u201d effort longer and significantly more expensive.\n\nOr consider Ukraine. Merkel insisted for months on fruitless dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the wake of the Kremlin\u2019s annexation of Crimea even as Moscow-supported separatists escalated the war in eastern Ukraine. It took the downing of Malaysian Airlines MH-17 in July 2014 with 298 people on board, several months after the conflict began, for Berlin to agree with U.S. demands to impose sanctions on Moscow. By then, Putin had what he wanted.\n\n\u201cWe remain very far from a resolution\u201d to the Ukraine conflict, Merkel lamented in Munich.\n\nShe went on to express frustration over the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), following years of Russian non-compliance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting constellation,\u201d she said, analyzing the episode as if she weren\u2019t a central player in it. \u201cA contract that was invented for Europe, a disarmament treaty that concerns our security, is canceled by the U.S. and Russia \u2026 and we\u2019re sitting here.\u201d\n\nThough Merkel stressed that the INF Treaty is in Europe's \u201cfundamental interest,\u201d she offered no explanation as to why Berlin didn\u2019t do more to preserve it.\n\n\u201cGerman voices are simply absent from the big debates of our time,\" Julianne Smith, who worked as a national security official in the Obama administration, wrote last week. \u201cIn the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw from the INF Treaty, Germany can\u2019t find its voice. Even in 2014, when President Barack Obama officially declared that Russia was violating the treaty, Germany responded with silence.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, there wasn\u2019t silence on all fronts. Then, as now, Merkel stressed the need for \u201cmultilateralism\u201d and \u201cpartnership\u201d to resolve policy differences.\n\n\u201cWhenever someone has something to raise, then we speak to one another,\u201d she said in Munich, explaining her approach to the Western alliance. \u201cThat\u2019s how the world works. Then we find a solution.\u201d\n\nIf only Merkel\u2019s words were matched by her actions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to intentionally shut out Russia\" \u2014 Angela Merkel\n\nWas it multilateralism when Merkel decided to take in more than 1 million refugees, expecting other European leaders to share the burden but not consulting with them first? Merkel\u2019s decision may have won the hearts of human rights activists the world over, but the political ramifications in Europe continue to resonate.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Merkel\u2019s Wir schaffen das ('We can manage') and the million migrants Germany took in in 2015, Brexit wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Alain Finkielkraut, the prominent French intellectual, told Die Welt this week. \u201cThat sent a shockwave through Europe. Europeans weren\u2019t asked.\u201d\n\nAnother example of the Merkel approach to multilateralism is Nord Stream 2, the planned Baltic gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find a German ally not opposed to the project, with the U.S., Scandinavia and Central Europe all voicing serious reservations that Nord Stream 2 will both deepen the region\u2019s reliance on Russia and harm Ukraine, currently an important transit route for Russian gas. Merkel\u2019s response: Plow ahead.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to intentionally shut out Russia,\u201d she explained in Munich.\n\nPerhaps Merkel\u2019s greatest achievement in international affairs during her 13 years as chancellor has been to win the adulation of the foreign policy establishment, which regards her as the \u201cleader of the free world,\u201d despite the inherent contradictions in her record.\n\nEven if Merkel has achieved little on the foreign stage, she says all the right things about multilateralism, the rules-based order, dialogue, etc. She\u2019s neither crass nor loud. In short, she\u2019s not Trump.\n\nThat\u2019s why Merkel \u2014 who refused to take the financial pressure off Greece when it struggled to cope with the terms of its bailouts \u2014 gets a free pass on issues like Germany\u2019s failure to meet the NATO obligation to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense by 2024. (Never mind that as one of the richest countries in the world, Germany can more than afford it.)\n\nThat\u2019s why everyone in Munich ignored her country\u2019s ballooning trade surplus with the world and cheered her when she insisted Germans are right to take pride in their car industry.\n\nIt\u2019s why they still clapped when she failed to offer a coherent answer to an audience member\u2019s question about what the greatest achievement of her tenure has been.\n\nAnd it\u2019s why they forgave what critics see as Merkel\u2019s greatest misstep of all, her failure to link arms with French President Emmanuel Macron to pursue deeper European integration.\n\nMerkel\u2019s failure to seize that opportunity \u2014 and not the \u201cmultilateralist\u201d vision she outlined in Munich \u2014 will mark her true legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not Trump or Putin that \u201cis the engine of the EU\u2019s existential crisis,\u201d Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau of Eurointelligence noted this week.

Bradley Byrne jumped into the campaign against the most vulnerable Democrat up for reelection, Alabama\u2019s Doug Jones.\n\nThe Senate is clearly in play in two years: At least a half-dozen Republican incumbents are at risk, including two in states President Donald Trump lost in 2016, and Democrats have already begun to recruit challengers in several of those races. After his shocking special election win in 2017 in deeply conservative Alabama, defeating Jones is the GOP\u2019s best opportunity to flip a Democratic-held seat \u2014 making the contest a vital insurance policy for the party to protect its majority, currently 53-47.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nJones narrowly won the Alabama seat after Republicans nominated Roy Moore, the controversial former state Supreme Court justice who faced accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior with teenage girls. Republicans in the state are desperate to avoid the mistakes of that race, when a fractious primary helped elevate Moore over the Senate GOP\u2019s preferred candidate, appointed Sen. Luther Strange.\n\nBut another crowded, unpredictable primary could be on the way. Byrne, a third-term congressman who ran for governor in 2010 and lost in the primary, has been hinting for more than a year that he would challenge Jones. At his official launch in Mobile on Wednesday, he highlighted his support for Trump's wall on the southern border, the Second Amendment, his anti-abortion stance and his support for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whom Jones opposed.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

The people that presently hold this seat intend to keep it and they will stop at nothing.\"\n\nIn an interview following his announcement, Byrne cited the same four issues as ones he believed Jones was most vulnerable with Alabama voters.\n\n\"The other big difference between last time and this time is Doug Jones now has a record, and it's not a good record to run on in Alabama,\" Byrne said.\n\n\"He's against President Trump and Alabama loves Donald Trump,\" the congressman added.\n\nJones' campaign cited Byrne's loss in the 2010 gubernatorial primary and labeled him a \"career politician\" in a statement\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter if Senator Jones has one opponent or 100,\" said the statement from Jones' campaign. \"His focus is working for the people of Alabama whether it's protecting our auto jobs and farmers against dangerous tariffs or building health care infrastructure in Alabama\u2019s rural communities.\"\n\nByrne is unlikely to have a clear path to the GOP nomination. Del Marsh, the president pro tempore of the state Senate, told POLITICO Tuesday he is \u201cseriously considering\u201d a campaign after passing on the 2017 special election. Some Republicans are calling on Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth to run, though he has not publicly discussed a potential bid and some Republicans doubt he will enter the race. Rep. Gary Palmer is also \u201cseriously considering\u201d the race, according to a source with knowledge of internal deliberations.\n\nTerry Lathan, chairwoman of the Alabama GOP, said Republicans are ready to \u201clock arms with a candidate\u201d against Jones regardless of who emerges from a potentially crowded, divisive primary.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate a war,\u201d Lathan said, predicting massive financial investments from both parties flooding the state. \u201cThere's going to be a busy, loud race. But with Donald Trump on the ballot in one of Trump\u2019s highest approval states, that's going to be \u2018advantage GOP.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe primary itself could become a war. Marsh, in an interview Wednesday, alluded to a potential line of attack against Byrne: his previous criticisms of Trump. Byrne criticized Trump and called on him to exit the presidential race in 2016 after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape emerged, though he said before the election he still planned to vote for him.\n\n\u201cI think we're going to need somebody there that has always supported this president, is going to continue to support this president, to his efforts at building this wall,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cI don't think it needs to be another D.C. politician. I think it needs to be a businessman, quite honestly, who has a business background, who understands this president.\u201d\n\nByrne, in the interview, brushed off that criticism. \"I've been happy and proud to be a supporter of President Trump ever since he came into office, before he came into office,\" Byrne said. \"If you look at my voting record, I'm one of the strongest supporters of the president.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the conservative Club for Growth released a poll showing Palmer tied with Byrne in a hypothetical head-to-head primary matchup (the poll did not include other candidates and had 46 percent undecided). David McIntosh, president of the Club, said Palmer would be the strongest candidate and said Byrne is \u201cnot a conservative,\u201d calling him a \u201cfake politician.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hope to avoid a scenario in which a competitive primary opens a lane for a controversial candidate to slip through the primary without majority support, making the general election much more difficult.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one guiding light when it comes to Alabama and it's just to ensure you have an electable nominee,\u201d said Republican strategist Josh Holmes, a top ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Holmes called the race a \u201cmust win\u201d for the GOP majority.\n\nPalmer has been encouraged to jump in by Republicans statewide and is \u201cseriously considering\u201d the race, according to a person familiar with his deliberations. The person said Palmer remains undecided, but that Byrne\u2019s announcement \u201cdoesn\u2019t impact his considerations.\u201d\n\nOne potential candidate who appears to be staying out is Rep. Mo Brooks, who lost the GOP primary in the 2017 special. Brooks said Wednesday that while he was not ruling out a bid, but he was unlikely to jump in unless it was clear he\u2019d be a favorite in the primary.\n\n\u201cIt would take a seismic political event to get me into the Senate race,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to pull off a seismic Senate event of their own in 2020, seeing a path back to the majority by defeating a handful of Republican incumbents around the country. Democrats are likely to target at least a half-dozen states where Republicans could be vulnerable, including Maine and Colorado, where Trump lost in 2016 and will be on the ballot again next year.\n\nIn Colorado, GOP Sen. Cory Gardner already has two Democratic challengers who have previously run for office statewide and several other Democrats are considering bids, signaling confidence in the party that they have a good chance to defeat Gardner.\n\nAnd Democrats have already begun recruiting top-tier candidates elsewhere. Mark Kelly, the former astronaut and Navy captain and husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, launched his campaign in Arizona last week and quickly raised more than $1.1 million for his challenge to Republican Sen. Martha McSally.\n\nKelly may still face a tough Democratic primary against Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is considering a campaign of his own. McSally was appointed to the Senate after losing her race against Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in November, and Democrats consider the state a top target once again.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear who might step forward for Democrats in two other key Senate states, Maine and North Carolina. But Democrats are also pushing to add Georgia to the list of top-tier battleground races by recruiting Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race last year, to challenge GOP Sen. David Perdue. Abrams has said she\u2019ll decide in March whether to run\n\nAnd Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer met recently with former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is considering a presidential campaign but has not ruled out running for Senate again in Texas after losing narrowly to GOP Sen.

They\u2019ve argued that McCabe's revelations, if true, underscore Trump\u2019s accusations of bias within the agencies investigating his campaign.\n\nOn Tuesday, McCabe disputed the insinuation made by some of his critics that he had decided to investigate Trump on his own, arguing that the decision was not a spurious one.\n\n\u201cOpening a case of this nature, not something an FBI director \u2014 not something that an acting FBI director \u2014 would do by yourself, right? This is a recommendation that came to me from my team,\u201d he said. \u201cI reviewed it with our lawyers. I discussed it at length with the deputy attorney general \u2026 and I told Congress what we\u2019d done.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Atlantic published Tuesday, McCabe said that while Comey\u2019s firing may have been the catalyst for launching the investigations, \u201cwe were building to this point for months before Jim was fired.\u201d\n\nHe said he could understand criticism if the investigations had been initiated solely as result of Comey\u2019s ouster, but insisted that was not the case.\n\n\u201cWe had several cases already open under the umbrella investigation of the Russia case \u2026 and the concern about the president and whether or not he posed a national security threat that we should be investigating had been building for some time,\" he said. \"But it was the events around the firing that kind of sealed the deal for me and the folks on the team.\"\n\nThe former FBI deputy director said that investigations being opened does not mean the agency had drawn any conclusions.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/1549/1155968404_6004858800001_6004867557001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nStill, he said, \u201cyou have to ask yourself; if you believe the president might have obstructed justice for the purpose of ending our investigation into Russia, you have to ask yourself why. Why would any president of the United States not want the FBI to get to the bottom of Russian interference in our election?\u201d\n\nHe referred to some of Trump's behaviors toward Russia, like welcoming the Russian foreign minister and state media into the Oval Office and reportedly taking the word of Russian President Vladimir Putin over that of the U.S. intelligence agencies, as \u201cinexplicable\u201d and \u201chead-scratching.\u201d\n\nHe said they \u201ccertainly could be\u201d the mark of someone who\u2019s compromised.\n\nAnd in an appearance on \u201cThe View\u201d later Tuesday, McCabe didn\u2019t dismiss the possibility that Trump had fired Comey at the direction of Russia, telling co-host Meghan McCain that \u201cwe don't know\u201d if Trump had done so.\n\nIn an excerpt of the book published last week, McCabe described the Gang of Eight briefing, which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also attended, as the moment when the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation was first announced.\n\nThe office of Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, declined to comment on McCabe\u2019s characterization of the briefing, and spokespeople for other lawmakers who were present in the briefing did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nMcCabe on Tuesday defended his dismissal from the FBI, which came last year just hours before he was set to retire. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited a DOJ inspector general\u2019s report that found McCabe had been dishonest multiple times with investigators about leaking information about an investigation to a reporter, which many have argued undermines McCabe\u2019s credibility.\n\nThe former deputy director said he plans to sue over his dismissal and claimed the report was pretextual and served to justify political motives. He said that before the watchdog report, he had enjoyed a long and blemish-free tenure at the FBI, and he told The Atlantic that it was \u201cvery hard\u201d to be \u201cbranded a liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've been writing and reading investigative reports for over 20 years. That report was not like anything I have ever read before,\u201d he said on \u201cToday.\u201d \u201cAn investigative report includes all of the evidence. It includes all the information, not just those facts that support the conclusion that you'd like to draw.\u201d\n\nHe declined to go into further detail, citing his pending lawsuit.\n\nMcCabe also sought to tamp down on one of the more salacious headlines emanating from his press junket, which have included a different take than Rosenstein's on how serious Rosenstein was about the idea of wearing a wire to record the president and discussions at the Justice Department about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Trump suggested such moves would be treasonous.\n\nRosenstein has pushed back on McCabe\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cThe important part about that comment that Rod made and the comment about the 25th Amendment: There was no effort underway, nobody wore a wire into the White House, nobody was plotting to stage a coup or remove the president,\u201d McCabe said on the \u201cToday\" Show, arguing that the situation was indicative of the extraordinary circumstances the Justice Department was in. \u201cThe point is the stress and complexity of the issues we were discussing at the time.\u201d\n\nHe called the attention paid to his allegations a distraction and cited the uproar as a reason he didn\u2019t include them in his book, saying in his appearance on \u201cThe View\u201d that\n\nHe told The Atlantic: \u201cI think it\u2019s illustrative of the conditions we were trying to navigate at the time. It was absolutely crazy.

Absolutely not,\" he said. \"You know, I felt like it was an incredibly invasive and potentially precedent-setting thing to do. I didn't think it was necessary at that point.\"\n\nAsked by Cooper whether he still believes the president could be a Russian asset, McCabe replied: \"I think it's possible.

Trump\u2019s expected celebration will come alongside mounting warnings.\n\nPresident Donald Trump this summer may be able to fire up his Twitter account and claim credit for overseeing the longest economic expansion in American history.\n\nHe just needs to avoid escalating his trade war with China, stoking a fight over the nation\u2019s debt limit or sparking some other economic crisis that casts a pall over his celebration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSigns are already piling up that the economy wobbled badly in December during the last government shutdown fight.

But Trump has not been shy about claiming full credit for the economy, repeatedly bragging about declines in unemployment that have persisted for a decade. So if the expansion officially tops the record books this summer, Trump will almost certainly look to take credit.\n\nBut lagging consumer and business confidence, rising consumer delinquencies and a shocking drop in retail sales in December \u2014 as the shutdown raged and markets swooned \u2014 has economists expecting growth of under 2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2018 and around 2 percent for this year. The 2019 numbers could go even lower if Washington emerges as a center of worry again later this year.\n\n\u201cThe shutdown fight hurt Trump and he owns it. One million households paid the cost,\u201d said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. \u201cTrump has little room left for another loss and the clock is ticking.\u201d\n\nFear of market and economic consequences helped drive Trump into accepting a spending deal last week that included far less than he wanted for his beloved border wall. Instead of prolonging the damage, Trump decided to move the fight into the courts and out of the realm of shutdowns. The same constraints could further hamper him as the year moves on, possibly driving him to accept a less robust trade agreement with China than he otherwise might have.\n\nTrump has hinted repeatedly in recent days that if he feels enough progress has been made with China, he could extend a March 1 deadline for cutting a deal. If no deal is reached by then, Trump previously promised to boost current tariffs on imports from China to 25 percent from 10 percent. And he\u2019s talked about adding tariffs on $267 billion more in Chinese imports, which would cover essentially everything China exports to the U.S.\n\nThe trouble is, every time Trump rattles the saber on China and it appears no deal will be made, Wall Street tends to sell off. And markets usually rise on any signal that a deal is near.\n\nThe president watches daily market moves very closely and loves to celebrate positive news, suggesting he may feel forced to cut a deal, even one that fails to achieve the enormous structural changes he is seeking from the Chinese.\n\nManufacturing is also slowing in the U.S., possibly in part because of the trade battle with China. That\u2019s something Trump \u2014 who based his 2016 campaign largely on bringing back manufacturing jobs \u2014 cannot allow to continue.\n\n\u201cI think this a big part of the reason why he is making warm noises about trade,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cHe needs to make a deal now, even if it\u2019s just woolly promises from China not to keep stealing U.S. intellectual property. Because he can\u2019t be seen to be allowing a short-term manufacturing downturn to morph into a long-term slump, for which he will get the blame.\u201d\n\nTrump would also risk serious economic and market dislocation if he pushes ahead with his long-threatened tariffs of as much as 25 percent on imported automobiles and auto parts. The U.S. auto industry has lobbied hard against the tariffs, and few inside the White House view them as good economic policy. A senior administration official suggested Trump is more likely to keep the threat of tariffs as a weapon in future trade talks rather than roll them out anytime soon.\n\nThe same constraints hold true for Trump when it comes to dealing with a Congress partially under Democratic control on funding for the wall and other priorities. The government shutdown in December slammed both Trump\u2019s approval rating and dramatically increased the risk that economic growth could grind to a halt.\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index dropped to 90.7 in January, the lowest level in over two years. Confidence among small businesses also dropped to its lowest level since before the 2016 election. Uncertainty among small businesses measured by the National Federation of Independent Business rose to the fifth-highest level in the survey\u2019s 45-year history.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating as measured by Gallup dipped to 37 percent during the shutdown, bouncing back to 44 percent after he signed legislation ending the impasse. During the shutdown, 44 percent of Americans said they thought economic conditions were improving. That number bounced to 54 percent after the shutdown.\n\nAll these numbers suggest that when Trump is presented with his next opportunity to use leverage to get what he wants from Congress, he will likely have to take a pass. The next big moment will come sometime this summer, when Treasury runs out of room to borrow money under the debt limit to pay the nation\u2019s bills.\n\nThe debt limit goes back into effect on March 2 and will likely be at about $22 trillion. Most estimates put the so-called X date, when Congress must raise the debt limit to avoid catastrophic default, sometime in mid-summer.\n\nAt that point, Trump might be tempted to seek more wall money in return for a debt limit hike, and Republicans might seek to force spending cuts given the soaring deficit, which swelled to nearly $800 billion in 2018. But even flirting with a debt limit crisis could tip an already shaky economy into turmoil while tanking markets, tying Trump\u2019s hands.\n\nThe same would also be the case in October, when Congress will have to reach another spending deal to avoid painful automatic budget cuts. If there is a debt limit scare or shutdown, it will likely hit growth, and Trump will get the blame. \u201cAnything negative the president does now can be used against him if growth keeps weakening,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan of High Frequency Economics.\n\nChina and the debt limit are not the only risks to the economy as Trump heads toward a difficult reelection fight in 2020. So far, he\u2019s largely gotten what he\u2019s wanted from the Federal Reserve, which paused its campaign of interest-rate hikes as growth slowed and markets wobbled late last year.\n\nBut rates are already rising, and the Fed could feel pressured to hike them further if a tight labor market starts to drive up wages and prices more quickly, possibly clamping down further on growth.\n\nUnrest in the Middle East or in Venezuela could impact already-volatile oil prices. And a slowdown in corporate earnings and business investment, as the impact of tax cuts fades, is also a concern cited by many economists.\n\nBut some of the biggest threats \u2014 a China trade war and big fiscal fights in the U.S. \u2014 are ones over which Trump has significant control. And his best bet may be to do nothing, according to Shepherdson. \u201cTrump just needs to keep out of the way,\u201d he said."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/18/trump-new-york-mueller-investigation-1173346", "text": "The bounds of what Southern District of New York is looking at don\u2019t deal with President Donald Trump\u2019s tenure in the White House, meaning any push back on executive privilege grounds won\u2019t fly. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images white house Trump can\u2019t run the Mueller playbook on New York feds For starters, they have jurisdiction over the president\u2019s political operation and businesses \u2014 subjects that executive privilege doesn't cover.\n\nEven as speculation mounts that special counsel Robert Mueller might be winding down his investigation, a parallel threat to President Donald Trump only seems to be growing within his own Justice Department: the Southern District of New York.\n\nManhattan-based federal prosecutors can challenge Trump in ways Mueller can\u2019t.

Legal circles are also buzzing over whether SDNY might buck DOJ guidance and seek to indict a sitting president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe threat was highlighted when SDNY prosecutors ordered officials from Trump\u2019s inaugural committee to hand over donor and financial records. It was the latest aggressive move from an office that has launched investigations into the president\u2019s company, former lawyer and campaign finance practices. New York prosecutors have even implicated Trump in a crime.\n\nAdd it all up and the result is a spate of hard-to-stymie, legally perilous probes that appears on track to drag on well into Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign. SDNY stands poised to carry on Mueller\u2019s efforts whenever the special counsel\u2019s office closes shop, and it\u2019s likely to draw even more attention if freshly confirmed Attorney General William Barr \u2014 who now oversees the Russia probe as DOJ head \u2014 clamps down on the public release of Mueller\u2019s findings.\n\nKeep up with POLITICO Playbook The 2020 Election.

The two DOJ units have shared staff, witnesses and leads, and SDNY has been well-positioned to pick up anything that is outside Mueller\u2019s primary lane of investigating collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nA Mueller referral to SDNY, for example, triggered an FBI raid on Michael Cohen's office and hotel room, according to Cohen\u2019s former lawyer. And the fruits of that raid culminated late last year in Cohen\u2019s guilty plea, in which the former Trump fixer and attorney admitted in federal court that Trump directed him to make hush money payments to sway the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe New York federal prosecutors are far from finished. They\u2019re still seeking interviews with Trump Organization executives, according to a source with knowledge of the probe. And Trump\u2019s inaugural committee confirmed earlier this month that it had received a wide-ranging subpoena from SDNY for documents as part of a probe into how the group raised and doled out a record $107 million. Investigators are looking at everything from potential mail and wire fraud to illegal foreign contributions and money laundering.\n\n\u201cThis is why I\u2019ve been saying for months that the Southern District of New York investigation presents a much more serious threat to the administration, potentially, than what Bob Mueller is doing,\u201d Chris Christie, a former New Jersey governor and former federal prosecutor, told ABC News earlier this month.\n\nElaborating on MSNBC , Christie said that SDNY, unlike Mueller, has \u201cno restrictions on their purview.\u201d\n\n\u201cBob Mueller has a task: It\u2019s Russian interference and potential collusion in the 2016 election,\u201d he said. \u201cSouthern District of New York is whatever the heck you want.\u201d\n\nSDNY poses a potent threat because the office has accumulated a perfect storm of witnesses who have guided Trump throughout his career, from his businesses to his meteoric rise in presidential politics up through his inauguration to the White House.\n\nThe list of cooperators includes Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization\u2019s longtime chief financial officer; David Pecker, the CEO of the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company who has admitted to working with Trump for years to kill incriminating media stories; and Rick Gates, who served as Trump campaign deputy and then de facto leader of the inaugural committee. Gates pleaded guilty in the Mueller probe to lying to the FBI last February but his sentencing has been delayed while he cooperates in \u201cseveral ongoing investigations,\u201d according to a filing last month from the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\nThen there\u2019s Cohen, Trump\u2019s longtime fixer who is scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison sentence next month. Christie called Cohen a \u201ctour guide\u201d for SDNY investigators into the president\u2019s orbit.\n\nAnother concern for Trump: SDNY\u2019s independence. Its nickname is the \u201cSovereign District of New York,\" and former prosecutors who have worked there describe its authorities and experience as unique among the nation's 93 U.S. attorney offices.\n\nThe president\u2019s hand-selected SDNY head, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, has been recused from the Cohen probe, deferring to a pair of longtime federal prosecutors: Robert Khuzami and Audrey Strauss.\n\nAn SDNY spokesman declined to comment for this story.\n\nAlumni from the office have said SDNY's investigative powers and independent streak are so robust that \u2014 depending on what it finds on Trump \u2014 the office could skirt DOJ legal protocol dating to Watergate that holds a sitting president can\u2019t be indicted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thoroughly convinced the SDNY will make its own evaluation. They will not say that\u2019s a department policy,\u201d said Jon Sale, a former SDNY and Watergate prosecutor who is close with Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously looking at the president and I wouldn\u2019t rule out that they could decide you can indict a sitting president.\u201d\n\nTrump's attack-Mueller playbook can\u2019t be replicated in New York. For starters, the bounds of what SDNY is looking at don\u2019t deal with Trump\u2019s tenure in the White House, meaning any pushback on executive privilege grounds won\u2019t fly. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said they\u2019ve resisted Mueller\u2019s attempts to get the president to answer questions about potential obstruction of justice matters dealing with his time in the Oval Office. And they continue to signal the president\u2019s team should be allowed to review the special counsel\u2019s finished report to ensure it doesn\u2019t violate the president\u2019s rights.\n\nTrump is limited in his abilities to use his bully pulpit against SDNY \u2014 which has nowhere near the name recognition of the special counsel \u2014 in the way he has used Twitter, rallies and even the State of the Union to lambaste Mueller.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the president isn\u2019t concerned about SDNY. Trump reportedly complained about SDNY\u2019s pursuit of Cohen to Matthew Whitaker, his former acting attorney general, though Whitaker last week denied to Congress that the president had chided him.\n\nGiuliani has confirmed Trump\u2019s frustrations with SDNY\u2019s handling of the Cohen probe.\n\n\u201cThe president and his lawyers are upset about the professional prosecutors in the Southern District of New York going after a noncrime and the innuendo the president was involved,\u201d Giuliani, who served as the U.S. attorney leading SDNY for more than five years during the Reagan administration, told CNN in December.\n\nBut in an interview with POLITICO on Friday, Giuliani downplayed any broader concerns that his former office posed a wider threat to the president.\n\n\u201cThe same thing will happen as has happened over the last two years with all of these things. They\u2019ll run them down and they\u2019ll find out the president didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Not a darn thing,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nTrump\u2019s complaints about the Mueller probe \u2014 railing against his team of \u201cangry Democrats\u201d and even going after the special counsel himself in more than 70 mentions on Twitter since last March \u2014 have helped the president turn his political base against the Russia investigation. A record low 13 percent of registered Republican voters reported having a favorable view of Mueller in a recent POLITICO/Morning Consult poll. While that can help the president maintain GOP support in an impeachment battle, legal experts and Trump\u2019s allies have said similar attacks on SDNY won\u2019t matter much should the battleground become a court of law and not the halls of Congress.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one you can\u2019t win,\u201d said Andrew McCarthy, a former SDNY prosecutor and National Review columnist whom the president has cited on Twitter while blasting the Mueller probe. \u201cThere\u2019s no upside for Trump in attacking the southern district, whereas there might be in attacking Mueller.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, SDNY\u2019s efforts have found allies in Democratic lawmakers who have made the U.S. attorney\u2019s office a key feature of their hearings, floor speeches and written demands of Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nAhead of Whitaker\u2019s recent appearance before Congress, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler told the acting DOJ head that SDNY\u2019s work would be one of his primary lines of questioning. And in a follow-up letter after the hearing, the New York Democrat pressed Whitaker over his denials that Trump lashed out at him about SDNY. Whitaker\u2019s rebuttals, Nadler said, were \u201cdirectly contradicted by several media reports\u201d and other people with \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d of the calls he got from the White House.\n\nIn a floor speech last week announcing his opposition to Barr\u2019s confirmation, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, warned that any Trump pardons for people tied up in either the Mueller or SDNY investigation \u201cwould represent an abuse of power that would require a response by Congress.\u201d\n\nBarr said SDNY\u2019s work stands on the other side of a red line that he wouldn\u2019t let Trump cross. Pressed by Democratic senators during his confirmation hearing last month, the soon-to-be attorney general said he\u2019d protest the removal of SDNY\u2019s head if he thought the president had nefarious intentions.\n\n\u201cI would not stand by and allow a U.S. attorney to be fired for the purpose of stopping an investigation,\u201d Barr said.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This report has been updated to more accurately reflect the SDNY chief\u2019s recusal."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/new-hampshire-kamala-harris-1173820", "text": "Kamala Harris didn\u2019t campaign in New Hampshire in the midterms \u2014 and some have questioned her chances of capturing the state in the primary. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images 2020 Elections New Hampshire gives Harris a hard time for rarely showing up\n\nMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Kamala Harris herself referred to it as the \u201celephant in the room.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether the California Democrat will compete in the first-in-the-nation primary hung over her Presidents Day town hall in Portsmouth \u2014 even after 1,000 people packed the church to see her and 500 more were turned away because the space was too full.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHarris, at the event, went out of her way in pledging to be active in the state, \u201cto shake every hand that I possibly can.\u201d\n\nBut history is not on her side.

Ahead of the 2020 primary, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont have spent months courting support from the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough for her,\u201d Stefan Mattlage, of the progressive grassroots group Kent Street Coalition in Concord, said of Harris. \u201cI think there\u2019s a home-area advantage here.\u201d\n\nSen.

Harris traveled to South Carolina before and after her presidential announcement and was in Iowa for her recent CNN town hall. She launched her campaign in Oakland, Calif., and has returned to her home state to raise money and lock down endorsements.\n\nSome of it may be structural. New Hampshire\u2019s open primary, which allows independents to participate, can favor mavericks and ideologues.

Sanders and Harris, at 65 percent and 63 percent, respectively, were ahead of Booker and Warren, who were at 61 percent and 60 percent.\n\nDemocratic state Rep.

Those polls show far more Democratic voters undecided about which candidate to support, and they pegged Biden\u2019s backing at a much less intimidating 9 to 12 percent.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe results are so varied partly thanks to different methodological choices by the pollsters. But parsing the results is more than an academic exercise: While Biden weighs a third campaign for the presidency, he and his allies must consider whether polls a year before primary season really reflect Biden\u2019s true strength \u2014 and his potential rivals have to calculate whether the former vice president could overwhelm lesser-known challengers in 2020.\n\n\u201cThese polls are today\u2019s reality,\u201d said Democratic pollster John Anzalone. \u201cAnd sometimes, today\u2019s reality holds until tomorrow and all the way until next year. And other times, today\u2019s reality changes. Primaries are like that.\u201d\n\nToday, the polling signs are that \u201cit\u2019s a very open field,\u201d said Steen Kirby, a campaigns and data specialist with Bold Blue Campaigns, a Democratic firm. \u201cPeople are weighing their options. I think the reason that so many people are getting in is because this is a 1-to-15 percent spread, not a 1-to-30 percent spread.

Respondents select from the choices \u2014 though some go a different route and volunteer another candidate or say they are undecided.\n\nBut critics say that setup forces voters to make a choice they\u2019ve barely considered this early. That makes Biden \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, Sanders \u2014 an appealing option: Democrats know and almost universally like Biden, even if they haven\u2019t thought a lot about whom they want to take on Trump 21 months from now.\n\n\u201cIn a race like this, the methodology stuff really does matter because it\u2019s such an open question,\u201d said Kirby, whose firm recently conducted a national poll of the 2020 Democratic presidential race. Bold Blue\u2019s poll gave respondents an explicit option to say they were undecided \u2014 and nearly half, 48 percent, took it.\n\nBiden still led the field, but with only 12 percent support. Sanders was third, with 9 percent, behind Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 11 percent.\n\nKirby thinks that is a more accurate reflection of the \u201chard-core\u201d Biden and Sanders support than the 30 or 20 percent, respectively, the two men draw in other polls.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/3884/1155968404_6002306400001_6002305149001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe Bold Blue Campaigns survey isn\u2019t the only poll to show Biden a lot closer to the other Democrats, with a larger share of undecideds. Last month, an ABC News/Washington Post poll asked respondents to volunteer the name of the person for whom they would vote in their state's Democratic primary or caucus.\n\nBiden stilled topped the field, but only at 9 percent. Harris was second at 8 percent, but no other candidate earned 5 percent. A majority of voters didn\u2019t name a candidate or said they were undecided.\n\nCompare those results to other polls that used lists of named candidates: The latest Morning Consult poll shows Biden at 29 percent, Sanders at 22 percent and Harris at 13 percent. A Monmouth University poll last month also had Biden at 29 percent, with Sanders at 16 percent and Harris at 11 percent.\n\nIn releasing the poll, Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, sounded a note of caution. \u201cAs with any presidential nominating contest at this point in time, voter preferences are driven largely by name recognition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very unusual if these results don\u2019t change substantially when we get closer to next year\u2019s primary contests. These early polls are most useful for looking at each candidate\u2019s profile among the party faithful to assess potential viability.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Biden is a strong front-runner or just the nominal leader of a wide-open race, he would bring significant goodwill among Democratic voters if he decides to run. He\u2019s easily the best-known and best-liked candidate: Nearly 4-in-5 Democrats, 78 percent, have a favorable opinion of Biden, greater than any other candidate. Only 2 percent say they\u2019ve never heard of the former vice president.\n\nIn addition to vote preference and candidate favorability, some of the early polls also ask Democratic voters what values and attributes are most important to them. In the Monmouth poll, a 56 percent majority said they would rather vote for a Democrat they don\u2019t agree with on most issues who would be stronger against Trump, compared with 33 percent who would choose a candidate they agree with more but would be weaker against Trump in November 2020.\n\nBiden allies cite electability as a reason why the early polls that show him leading don\u2019t paint a distorted picture of the race.\n\n\u201cTheir top reason to vote for someone is going to be who can [beat] Trump. In that paradigm, Biden has the broadest level of support,\u201d said Anzalone, who has been linked to a potential Biden campaign. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I think that he will retain more of his current support than we\u2019ve seen in previous years, when early poll[-leading] candidates slide.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all speculation, and horse-race polls this far from an election \u2014 let alone a progressive series of 57 elections in different states and territories \u2014 aren\u2019t intended to be predictive. But they do matter. Campaigns and prospective campaigns are examining private and public polling for hints about viability and strategy. The Democratic National Committee is using public poll results to determine eligibility for the party\u2019s first primary debates this spring.\n\nThe various 2020 Democratic polls \u201cstill all tell the same story: that it\u2019s a wide-open race,\u201d said Margie Omero, a Democratic pollster.

In the Quinnipiac poll, 33 percent of Democrats, 60 percent of Republicans and 43 percent of independents say Northam should quit \u2014 even though Democrats (80 percent) are more likely than Republicans (62 percent) to say they consider blackface to be racist.\n\nIn the Ipsos/U-Va. poll, 20 percent of Democrats say Northam should quit, compared with 43 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe scandal has taken a toll on Northam\u2019s approval ratings, the new polls show, though they have not cratered. In the Quinnipiac poll, 39 percent of voters approve of the job Northam is doing, while slightly more, 43 percent, disapprove. In the Ipsos/U-Va. poll, a plurality, 44 percent, say they neither approve nor disapprove of Northam\u2019s job performance, compared to 17 percent who approve and 34 percent who disapprove.\n\nOne factor boosting Northam\u2019s chances of surviving is the continued support of black voters, who made up roughly 20 percent of the electorate in his 2017, off-year victory over Republican Ed Gillespie. In the Quinnipiac poll, twice as many black voters approve of the job he is doing versus disapprove, 49 percent to 24 percent. About a quarter of black voters in Virginia, 24 percent, say Northam is racist, but a 63 percent majority say he isn\u2019t.\n\nNortham\u2019s position has also been reinforced by the controversies around Fairfax and Herring \u2014 the two men next up in Virginia\u2019s line of succession for governor. Two women have accused Fairfax of past sexual assaults, including Meredith Watson, who outlined in a Washington Post op-ed this week her call for a public hearing into her allegation that Fairfax raped her when they were students at Duke University in 2000.\n\nHerring, meanwhile, admitted he, too, wore blackface at a party in 1980 while attending the University of Virginia \u2014 even though he had, days earlier, called for Northam\u2019s resignation.\n\nOf the three top Democrats, the new polls out Wednesday show Fairfax may be in the most peril. While a plurality in the Quinnipiac poll say Northam shouldn\u2019t resign, and a 54 percent majority say Herring should remain in office \u2014 voters are split on Fairfax: 36 percent say the lieutenant governor should resign, and 36 percent say he shouldn\u2019t.\n\nIn the Ipsos/U-Va. poll, more voters say Fairfax should resign, 35 percent, than say he shouldn\u2019t, 25 percent. But roughly a third, 34 percent, say they aren\u2019t sure.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Feb. 14-18, surveying 1,150 registered voters in Virginia by landline and cell phone. The margin of error, including design effect, is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.\n\nThe Ipsos/U-Va. poll was conducted online from Feb. 15-19. In that survey, 636 adults in Virginia were interviewed, and those results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/covington-high-school-student-sues-washington-post-1176017", "text": "The suit alleges that The Washington Post\u2019s coverage of the incident was used \u201cin furtherance of its political agenda.\u201d | Alex Wong/Getty Images Legal Teen in video face-off with Native American sues Washington Post for $250 million\n\nThe Kentucky teenager at the center of a confrontation last month with a Native American man at the Lincoln Memorial has sued The Washington Post, alleging that the newspaper made \u201cfalse and defamatory accusations\u201d against him in its coverage of the episode.\n\nNicholas Sandmann, 16, a student at Covington Catholic High School in Park Hills, Ky., is seeking $250 million in damages from The Post \u2014 the same amount Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos paid for ownership of the paper in 2013, according to a copy of the suit Sandmann\u2019s attorneys posted on their website.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAmong various complaints, the suit alleges that the Post \u201cengaged in a modern-day form of McCarthyism\u201d to target Sandmann \u201cbecause it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against\u201d President Donald Trump.\n\nIn video accounts of the Jan. 18 encounter, a grinning Sandmann is depicted wearing a red Make America Great Again baseball cap as he stares down Nathan Phillips, an Omaha elder and Vietnam veteran who sings and beats a drum as Covington students laugh and jeer around him.\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

She\u2019s stressed repeatedly that the GOP\u2019s votes are procedural and political, not intended to shape policy.\n\n\u201cShe thinks the caucus should vote together,\u201d said one senior Democratic aide. \u201cThe more you act afraid of these things, the more Republicans seize on it and that\u2019s why she\u2019s so annoyed by this.\u201d\n\nBut Hoyer and Clyburn have personally told freshmen they may side with Republicans, as long as Democrats don\u2019t lose the overall vote \u2014 breaking a years-long precedent among party leaders in the majority.\n\n\u201cMy position has always been, if it does no harm, and members feel that\u2019s a vote they need to cast, then it\u2019s fine with me,\u201d Clyburn said in an interview Wednesday. Hoyer, similarly, \u201cbelieves members should vote their districts,\u201d according to his spokeswoman.\n\nThe procedural votes have been particularly vexing for Democrats in traditionally GOP seats. Leaders of the two centrist groups with the most vulnerable freshmen \u2014 the Blue Dogs and New Democrats \u2014 have encouraged their freshmen to vote how they feel rather than enforcing party unity, according to multiple sources.\n\nHoyer and Clyburn huddled with several of those vulnerable members in mid-January and reiterated that same message \u2014 as long as enough lawmakers don\u2019t vote with Republicans to actually approve the GOP-backed amendment. In that meeting Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), a leader of the Blue Dogs, was deputized as the liaison between endangered Democrats and leadership when it came to these votes.\n\nSince then, the topic has repeatedly come up at leadership meetings and on the House floor as lawmakers on both sides of the issue vent about the impasse and blame each other.\n\nMultiple sources privately pointed fingers at Clyburn, saying his whip operation wasn\u2019t assembled in time to keep enough members in line when Republicans started pushing the votes in January. \u201cNow you can\u2019t put the toothpaste back in the tube,\u201d said one Democratic source.\n\nOther members said the opposite, complaining privately that lawmakers on Clyburn\u2019s whip team are too forceful in trying to pressure freshmen to change their votes and side with the majority.\n\nDemocrats struggled with the same problem last time they were in the majority between 2007 and 2011 and had a cluster of vulnerable members in Republican-leaning districts to protect. The Democratic-led House approved the GOP\u2019s procedural votes roughly one-fifth of the time during those years.\n\nBut Democratic leaders are now worried that if one of the particularly prickly GOP amendments succeeds, it could sink whatever Democratic bill is on the floor, an embarrassing flop for the party in power.\n\n\u201cUnity is important,\u201d said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Pelosi ally and senior member of Clyburn\u2019s whip team. \u201cThe default should be, if we have a Democratic majority\u2026 then members should have confidence that the bill being produced is the best we can produce. I think there are rare occasions when a member might feel squeezed, or might have a particular issue that\u2019s important to them. But I don\u2019t think it should be frequent.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Joe Cunningham says: \u201cSometimes I have to break from the party.\u201d | Mic Smith/AP Photo\n\nSeveral Democrats who have voted with Republicans on some of the motions said they feel like they\u2019ve been thrown in the line of fire at a time when GOP political operatives are crafting their next attack ads in a push to retake the majority.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be unified if you\u2019re not here,\u201d said one Democratic lawmaker who has voted for the procedural votes. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make somebody walk the plank for the sake of walking the plank. \u2026 This is really about protecting the majority.\u201d\n\nBut other Democrats complain that the members who vote the most with Republicans are doing so just to lower the overall percentage that they vote with Democratic leaders, hoping it will lessen GOP abilities to attack them as partisan in 2020.\n\n\u201cI just vote for what\u2019s best for my district,\u201d said Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), a freshmen who frequently supports the GOP procedural votes.\n\n\u201cSometimes I have to break from the party,\u201d added Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), who has voted for a majority of the GOP motions. \u201cIt depends on how I feel at the time.\u201d\n\nSome long-time Democrats say they\u2019re frustrated that freshmen aren\u2019t expected to stick with the party.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter, there are a bunch of freshmen, who have determined for whatever reason, that they\u2019re always going to take the safe vote,\u201d said Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, a senior member of the Democratic whip team.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s something that Democrats have to handle,\u201d Richmond added. \u201cThis is not the neighborhood association, this is the United States Congress. You\u2019re going to have to take hard votes.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 approach to letting some members loose has created new opportunities for the House GOP leadership, which has a team of staffers tasked with targeting their opponent\u2019s vulnerabilities in each bill that hits the floor.\n\nHouse Republicans, under the leadership of Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, have designed the measures to be as politically painful as possible for Democrats.\n\nOne amendment would have banned pay increases for federal workers who have been disciplined for sexual misconduct. Another would have forced veterans\u2019 child care centers to suspend any workers who have been accused of drug-related or violent crimes.\n\nMcCarthy and his top deputies couldn\u2019t believe their luck Wednesday when they succeeded with one of their procedural votes and forced Democrats to again confront the controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s (D-Minn.) tweets on U.S.-Israel policy.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats complained, all but 18 Republicans turned around and voted against the underlying bill cutting off aid to Saudi Arabia in Yemen\u2019s civil war \u2014 further proof, they say, that the votes are purely partisan messaging tools.\n\nWednesday\u2019s vote had GOP lawmakers and aides salivating at what they saw as a huge victory in an institution where the minority has almost no power. Republicans never once lost such a procedural vote when they were in the majority.\n\n\u201cThe way I see it is you\u2019re not going to win or lose reelection on the basis of a procedural vote\u201d said Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.), who won a long-time GOP seat last fall. \u201cThe opposition [is] going to try to attack us for everything.\u201d\n\n\n\nLaura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez and John Bresnahan contributed to this report."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/video/2019/02/12/trump-border-security-bipartisan-067714", "text": ""}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/video/2019/02/12/2020-women-democratic-presidential-candidates-067713", "text": ""}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/video/2019/01/09/the-legality-behind-president-trumps-national-security-threat-067612", "text": ""}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/gallery/2019/02/04/matt-wuerker-cartoons-february-2019-003115", "text": "Matt Wuerker\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nPolitical cartoons from the desk of Matt Wuerker."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/15/congress-trump-funding-shutdown-talks-1170931", "text": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's proposed conference committee succeeded in negotiating a bipartisan border security deal. | AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley Government Shutdown How Schumer and McConnell kept Trump out of the shutdown talks While the president claims he\u2019s the dealmaker-in-chief, it was veteran lawmakers who got it done.\n\nThe day before the 35-day government shutdown ended, Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell huddled privately to figure out some way everyone could save face and end the biggest congressional crisis in years.\n\nThe Senate majority leader first floated providing a pro-rated piece of wall money for President Donald Trump, which Schumer rejected. Then the minority leader tried to isolate the troubled Department of Homeland Security spending bill and fund the rest of the government, which McConnell spurned.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFinally, they hit upon a solution.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Here\u2019s my proposal to you. Let\u2019s do a conference committee. They are good at it, they get along, they\u2019ve done the other six budget bills, they can do this,\u2019\u201d Schumer recounted in his office Thursday as a months-long funding crisis was concluding. \u201cAnd he accepted. And I think that paved the way to getting this done.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump first announced he was giving Congress three weeks to reach a border security deal, few in Washington thought bipartisan negotiations would achieve anything.\n\nBut the story of how the conference committee and its leaders succeeded after so many brutal months fighting over Trump\u2019s wall is a simple one, according to more than a dozen lawmakers and aides: Trump largely stayed out of it. And seasoned veterans were allowed to do what they\u2019ve done their entire congressional careers \u2014 figure out diplomatic ways to spend hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

And nothing could get done until negotiators got \u201cPelosi and Trump and Schumer out of the room,\u201d added Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho).\n\nThe negotiations broke down over the weekend, but senior lawmakers didn\u2019t really sweat until Trump was presented with the final product. In true Trump fashion, the president kept everyone waiting to know whether he\u2019d cast the city into chaos once again. And then he stunned even members of his own party by deciding at the eleventh hour to pursue an explosive national emergency declaration to further fund his wall.\n\nThe week leading up to Friday\u2019s government funding deadline was characterized by a dramatic round of ups and downs.\n\nOn Monday, when Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) announced that a deal had been reached, most of Congress was ecstatic and relieved the impasse that led to the longest shutdown in history would finally be ending.\n\nBut with no bill text, Trump was perplexed.\n\nAs Shelby walked the president through the agreement on Tuesday, the president began venting about the legislation. Trump was not happy to learn the bill would leave him with about a quarter of the border barrier funding he\u2019d insisted upon in the run-up to the shutdown.\n\nThe president\u2019s initial anger at what the conference committee produced brought Democratic delight. Over and over, the president had tried unsuccessfully to peel off moderate Democrats to break with Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi and force the party to cave on wall funding.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a great negotiator. He\u2019s a bully. And that\u2019s what the real estate people will tell you in New York. He doesn\u2019t come up with clever compromises, he tries to bully them, sue them,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cHe knows he can\u2019t push me around.\u201d\n\nNegotiators wouldn\u2019t iron out the final details and unveil the measure until late Wednesday night \u2014 further worrying the White House about what exactly was in the bill. Congressional sources described an intense 24 hours of conversations with the president. With no bill text, opponents of the deal began attacking it and concern grew that Trump wouldn\u2019t support it.\n\nThe president and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney began dialing McConnell and House Minority Leader McCarthy (R-Calif.), nervous about certain provisions. The president never threatened to veto the package, but was concerned that it would limit his ability to build the wall.\n\nThe GOP leaders pressed home their main points to the president repeatedly: Democrats agreed to $1.375 billion in new barrier funding that Trump could call a wall, and Republicans rejected a statutory cap for ICE detention beds that Democrats sought.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi said not one dollar for the wall, said she would end all the detention beds, and they\u2019d eliminate ICE,\u201d McCarthy argued in an interview. \u201cThe president came out well on this bill.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump told Shelby he was on unhappy on Tuesday, by Wednesday evening he was feeling better.\n\n\u201cHe seemed to be very interested. I don\u2019t recall him saying he was unhappy,\u201d Shelby recounted.\n\nIn fact, at one point on Thursday, just hours before Congress was set to vote, Mulvaney suggested passing a stopgap spending bill to allow a waffling Trump more time to review the package without tumbling into another shutdown. That\u2019s something most on Capitol Hill loathed: The longer a bill hangs out there, the more likely it is to accrue opposition. And a stopgap measure actually would give Trump less money for his restrictive immigration priorities.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s idea would also have scuttled months of hard work on what may be the last substantial spending agreement before the 2020 election to be crafted by Shelby, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) and the other top two spending chiefs, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas).\n\nThe foursome had already brought the agreement back from the brink of collapse over the weekend after a surprising issue almost derailed the talks: A proposal by liberal Democrats to place a hard cap on the number of undocumented immigrants that Immigration and Customs Enforcement could hold in the interior of the country.\n\nDemocrats maintain they had been negotiating with Republicans on capping detention beds all along, but Republicans insist the idea came out of nowhere over the weekend. It was a flashpoint that threatened to tank the talks, but it also seemed to earn Democrats new leverage over the GOP on fence funding.\n\n\u201cI think that cost a half a billion dollars for us,\u201d said a GOP source involved in the talks.\n\nShelby initially walked away from the negotiations on Saturday over the detention beds dispute: \u201cI said \u2018no way,\u2019 because it was ridiculous,\u201d he said. He then went on TV Sunday and claimed everything was slipping away.\n\nHouse Democratic negotiators held an emergency conference call Sunday morning as Shelby was diminishing the chances of a deal. Pelosi, who had been keeping in close touch with Schumer and negotiators over the weekend, dialed in from the West Coast to get a read on the standoff.\n\nLowey and Shelby then talked on the phone several times, and Lowey suggested the four old bulls meet.\n\nPelosi phoned Lowey and California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, another top Democratic negotiator, on Monday afternoon on her way to the airport, and suggested the Democrats\u2019 position on detention beds was untenable.\n\nLater Monday afternoon the top negotiators \u2014 Lowey, Shelby, Leahy and Granger \u2014 met in Shelby\u2019s office for more than an hour. In the meeting, Democrats expressed flexibility on the detention beds issue, then pressed pause as senators left for a vote.\n\nMeanwhile, House Democratic staffers were busy preparing a stop-gap funding bill they could file as soon as Monday night if the last-ditch effort went nowhere.\n\n\u201cWe thought the talks had completely blown up,\u201d said one Democratic source familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThey spending chiefs reconvened in Leahy\u2019s office, then broke for a House vote. Lowey and Roybal-Allard met with the other House Democratic negotiators one last time. The group agreed to relent on the cap on detention beds in exchange for less barrier money.\n\nLowey, Shelby, Leahy and Granger then met once more at 8 p.m., before announcing the pact. The four wrangled over the number of detention beds to fund in the bill, then moved on to barrier spending.\n\nThe group had been discussing $1.45 billion in funding for barriers, but Lowey said she couldn\u2019t go back to her caucus unless that number was reduced to $1.375 billion.\n\nFinally, they had a deal. Leahy and Shelby stood side by side in front of a crowd of reporters announcing an \u201cagreement in principle\" had been reached, in a bipartisan show of support.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love everything in this bill. I\u2019m sure that Republicans don\u2019t love everything in this bill,\u201d Lowey said Thursday night. \u201cBut we understand \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 that we have a responsibility to fund the government and move on.\u201d\n\nYet the talks again got a dicey on Tuesday as congressional staff haggled over language that would protect a handful of specific \u201csensitive areas\u201d along the border \u2014 including a butterfly nature preserve \u2014 from barrier construction. The language was a top priority for Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the only conferee from the border.\n\nIn the final hours before the bill was set, Democratic and Republican leaders fought over multiple other provisions \u2014 everything from an extension of the Violence Against Women Act to back pay for federal contractors. In the end, all extraneous elements were left out of the final package.\n\nDemocrats also sought limits on reprogramming ICE funds and changes to asylum rules, but Republican negotiators again refused, said the sources.\n\nWithin 24 hours after the text of the 1,159-page bill was released, the Senate had passed it 83-16 and the House had followed suit, 300-128. The president would sign it into law on Friday in the Rose Garden.\n\nYet even as Trump tried to calm anger on the right by simultaneously endorsing the package and declaring plans to declare a national emergency through an unusual floor announcement from McConnell, Schumer kicked back in his office feeling like he\u2019d won the only battle that mattered.\n\nRegardless of how Trump\u2019s gambit plays in the courts, he didn\u2019t get what he wanted from Congress.\n\n\u201cNo wall. That\u2019s the watch word. The whole debate here was whether he was going to get his wall,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t, at all.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferris and Caitlin Emma contributed to this report.\n\n"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/18/marijuana-factories-explosions-safety-issues-1155850", "text": "In 2016, two workers were sent to a burn unit after an explosion, pictured here, at a medical marijuana processor in Oregon.

Nearly all resulted in serious injuries for production-line staff.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe extraction process is continuing to evolve,\" Raymond Bizal, director of California and Oregon regional operations for the National Fire Protection Association, told POLITICO. \"The fire-safety industry has to play catch-up.\u201d\n\nMost of the states where marijuana is legal offer no safety and health guidance for the new industry. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which researches work-related injury and illness, has conducted only two hazard evaluations of legal marijuana facilities, neither of which focused on the extraction of hash oil. Even in those states that do offer safety and health guidance \u2014 Colorado, California, Michigan, Oregon, and Washington \u2014 fire safety officials complain that worker safety protections are often inadequate.\n\nWorker safety is a matter of growing urgency because legal marijuana is a booming business. In 2018 there were an estimated $10.4 billion in U.S. sales of legal medical and recreational marijuana. That translated into 259,000 jobs, according to cannabis research firm New Frontier Data. Some estimates project sales to reach $40 billion by 2021.\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) called for federal legalization on Feb. 11, and even confessed that \"a long time ago\" she'd smoked the stuff herself. \"I did inhale,\" she said (an allusion to candidate Bill Clinton's much-mocked claim in 1992 that he did not). Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), another presidential hopeful, introduced a bill in 2017 to legalize marijuana at the federal level.\n\nBut labor unions complain that state governments are moving too swiftly to license producers, outpacing the states' ability to inspect production facilities for potential safety violations. Unions also want more certification training to teach workers how to handle machinery and equipment properly.\n\nExtracting hash oil from cannabis is dangerous because typically it requires pouring highly-flammable butane or some other volatile solvent into a cannabis-filled pipe. The butane strips THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, from the cannabis plant, which then drips down in liquid form and is collected for consumption in cannabis-laced chocolate, butter, or tea, or, more directly, in hash-oil vape pens.\n\nIn Arizona last year, a fire at a legal medical marijuana facility erupted after a worker improperly stored a can of butane, causing an explosion.\n\n\"This is something fire departments and law enforcement and city code officials will have to deal with,\" Fire Capt. Mark Dillon of Coolidge, Ariz., told ABC\u2019s Nick Ciletti at the time.\n\nWhen performed in illegal marijuana operations \u2014 often located in residential locations \u2014 the processing of marijuana for hash oil has long been known to cause frequent deadly explosions. In 2017 the Drug Enforcement Agency recorded fires or explosions in roughly 10 percent of all illegal extraction labs nationwide.\n\nWith hash oil extraction now legal in 33 states, what once was a hazard for law enforcement to address is fast becoming the responsibility of state regulators of occupational health and safety.\n\nTwo of the 33 states bar the use of butane to extract hash oil in professional operations. New York, for instance, allows extraction only when the agent used is carbon dioxide or alcohol; a processor who wishes to use an alternative method must receive specific approval. Eleven states require a \u201cclosed loop\u201d system that contains the flammable agent, preventing its release into the air, where it can ignite. Rhode Island, which is weighing whether to legalize marijuana, would bar use (and therefore extraction) of hash oil except in certain medical situations.\n\nFollowing an uptick in explosions in Colorado, fire officials there persuaded the National Fire Protection Association, which establishes a fire code for the whole country, to amend its rules to address hazards at facilities that grow and extract marijuana. The revised code requires any hazardous hash-oil extraction process to be performed in a non-combustible room, in a building that contains no child or health care facilities. Staff must be trained on safe operation of the extraction equipment, and the extraction room must be equipped with a gas detection system and multiple fire extinguishing systems.\n\nIn states that are weighing legalizing marijuana, labor groups are pressing to include in legalization bills \u201clabor peace provisions\u201d that require marijuana processors to ease the path to unionization. Doing so, they say, keeps \u201can open line of communication\u201d on worker safety matters. \u201cWe see unions in our work as providing a safeguard for the workers,\u201d said Nikki Kateman, communications director for the United Food and Commercial Workers' Local 338, which is advising New York on safety matters as it legalizes adult marijuana use this year.\n\nSafety at legal marijuana facilities remains mostly a state matter because the federal government hasn\u2019t legalized consumption.\n\nFederal safety and health standards do apply to marijuana companies, but many are too small to fall under the jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Since 1977, a rider that's included routinely in appropriations bills prevents the agency from inspecting farm operations with 10 employees or fewer.\n\nVermont, which has its own occupational safety and health program, says Vermont OSHA has \u201cnot performed any inspections or investigations associated with marijuana cultivation or manufacturing.\u201d The first medical dispensary opened in the state in 2013.\n\nHash-oil processing \u201ccan be done safely,\u201d said Bizal, of the National Fire Protection Association, when it is \u201cdone properly and following the rule and regulations.\u201d But as the industry has grown, safety hazards have proliferated in legal marijuana operations \u2014 some drawing steep fines and even felony convictions of legal proprietors.\n\nIn December, California\u2019s occupational safety and health agency fined a cannabis manufacturer $50,470 after an explosion badly burned a worker who was using propane to extract oil. In June, an explosion at a cannabis producer in Washington sent one worker to the hospital, although it was unclear whether the blast was attributable to hash-oil extraction.\n\nIn 2016, two workers were sent to a burn unit after an explosion at a medical marijuana processor in Oregon. Felony charges were later brought against the business owner. \"This is really not a drug case; this is a case about recklessness and an industrial accident,\" then Oregon's Clatsop County District Attorney Josh Marquis told the Oregonian at the time.\n\nThat same year in New Mexico, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined a medical marijuana dispensary $13,500 after a hash-oil explosion so powerful that it separated the roof from the wall and sent two employees to the hospital. One 29-year-old worker \u201csuffered third-degree burns to a high percentage of his body, had a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit and needed multiple skin grafts,\u201d according to the Santa Fe New Mexican.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers has organized thousands of cannabis workers across the country, often using safety issues as a prod. In New York, where Local 338 is advising the state on health and safety inspection procedures, the union's secretary-treasurer, Joe Fontano, says \u201chaving a collective bargaining agreement allows the union to ensure that proper safety procedures are in place.\u201d\n\nUFCW fears that if states move too quickly on legalization, that will compromise their ability to monitor marijuana workers' health and safety. \u201cIf you over-license,\" one UFCW official said, \"you ... put too much of a burden on inspectors and the enforcement division.\u201d\n\nIf states move too slowly to legalize, however, they risk ending up with more illegal hash-oil extraction operations. Because these aren't supervised at all, they're much more dangerous. In 2017 the DEA\u2019s El Paso office identified 260 illegal extraction labs across the country, about one-third in residential locations. Fires or explosions were reported in more than 10 percent of them.\n\nAt this point marijuana is likelier to be at least partly legal in any given state than not. Thirty-three states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico have legalized marijuana, most for medical use, and 10 states and the District of Columbia permit recreational use as well, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Another 13 states allow the use of CBD products (the non-intoxicating oil in the plant, usually used to treat pain and anxiety) for medical reasons in limited situations. That leaves only four states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas \u2014 with no laws permitting marijuana use under any circumstances.\n\nTwo jurisdictions, Vermont, and Washington D.C., legalized marijuana use but barred retail sale of the product. These jurisdictions maintain oversight over medical marijuana dispensaries and allow recreational use only if users purchase it elsewhere, receive it as a gift, or grow it themselves. That may encourage residents to obtain concentrated hash oil products illegally, or to extract them at home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem that states face after possession becomes legal, but before retail sales and businesses are legal,\u201d Morgan Fox, media relations director at the National Cannabis Industry Association, explained to POLITICO. \u201cThere\u2019s no source for these extracted products and concentrates other than the illicit market.\u201d\n\nSome states see a possible solution to hash extraction's workplace dangers in not allowing extraction at all. In addition to Rhode Island's pending legislation to legalize marijuana but not hash oil, the Arizona Supreme Court is considering whether marijuana extracts are legal under the state's medical marijuana law.\n\nBut management-side attorneys warn that increased regulation will likely make it more difficult for cannabis employers to find trained staff, who must pass certain background checks and receive approval by state\u2019s marijuana regulatory bodies.\n\n\u201cContracting out work isn\u2019t really an option in this industry,\u201d explained George Voegele, a member of Cozen O'Connor's Labor & Employment practice. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for employers to make significant changes to their employee rosters.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/08/ralph-northam-blackface-racism-224931", "text": "AP Photo/Steve Helber Politics Will Purging Politicians for Blackface Really Move Us Closer to Racial Progress?\n\nIssac Bailey is a journalist based in South Carolina and author of the 2018 book My Brother Moochie: Regaining Dignity in the Face of Crime, Poverty, and Racism in the American South.

My job is to help the court understand he is more than one alleged act, even one as despicable as murder.\n\nShortly after leaving the meeting, I came across the biggest news of the day: The Democratic attorney general of Virginia, Mark Herring, admitted to dressing in blackface in 1980 when he was a 19-year-old college student to portray iconic rapper Kurtis Blow. Unless you\u2019ve been living in an off-the-grid cabin, you know it was the second blackface incident in the state in a week: Last weekend, a Virginia newspaper published a photo of Democratic Governor Ralph Northam\u2019s medical school yearbook page from the 1980s, showing two students dressed up, one in blackface and the other as a Ku Klux Klan member. (Northam has denied being either man.) The Internet was soon alight with 2020 Democratic presidential contenders calling for Northam to step down and an endless number of think pieces about blackface.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOther things were happening in the United States, too.\n\nThe Herring news came about 12 hours after Donald Trump, who had risen to national political prominence with the enthusiastic support of white nationalists, gave the State of the Union address before a still mostly white Congress. It\u2019s the same Congress that includes a representative who recently defended the term \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d in an on-the-record interview with the New York Times.\n\nThe Herring news happened in a state where a protester was killed during a rally of white supremacists and white nationalists in 2017. The rally was held to protest the removal of statues in a public square dedicated to men who seceded from the United States to create a new nation where white people would be able to continue to enslave black people.\n\nAmid such a dismal state of racial affairs in the country today, one has to wonder if all the (justified) outrage over blackface is being aimed at the correct place. Are we really focusing on the roots of America\u2019s racial problems, or just working ourselves up over a single symptom?\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/716/1155968404_6001768069001_6001766864001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nIf this expanding purge of those who committed any racial sins in their past keeps engulfing more people, in a few years we could look back at 2019 as the year of dumb, destructive racial politics. Though the blackface awakening is good and overdue, it doesn\u2019t seem wise to \u201ccancel\u201d all past offenders. If we do, it may well be black people who suffer the most, because the superficial will have been conflated with the deep and pervasive, and the energy we should have been spending on dismantling mass incarceration and a legacy of segregated housing and education that still affects much of the country will have been wasted on blackface hunts.\n\nThe list of offenders is already lengthy. Comedian Joy Behar wore makeup darker than her skin at a party long ago. Virginia state Sen. Tommy Norment edited a yearbook decades ago that included racist slurs and photos. Anthony Sabatini, a state representative in Florida, dressed in blackface while in high school as a prank with a black friend. It won\u2019t be hard to find more.\n\nOf course, I understand why Northam\u2019s yearbook photo, and the others, are so wrong. Blackface is ugly. It\u2019s racist. It\u2019s among black people\u2019s worst nightmares, that our political allies may harbor unexamined cruel, even mocking thoughts about us. Secret prejudices are worse when they belong to people in power. And there are several offenses, no matter how long ago they were committed that would absolutely be disqualifiers for anyone who holds offices\u2014employment or housing discrimination, for instance, or a racist assault, verbal or physical.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider where this purge against politicians\u2019 slighter racial offenses might lead. Given that Virginia\u2019s black lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax is embroiled in a growing controversy about an alleged sexual assault, and is now vulnerable himself, purging the governor and attorney general for decades-old racial offenses could upend everything Virginia Democrats accomplished in the past couple of years, including providing a check against Trump both in Virginia and nationally.\n\nSuch dysfunction would also likely affect state Democrats\u2019 fortunes in upcoming Virginia elections. Those elections help decide who controls the redistricting process in a state that has been locked in a years-long struggle over racial gerrymandering. In other words, a purge purported to be about honoring black people\u2019s humanity and addressing past wrongs might undo hard-won black progress.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear that this is a meaningful reckoning on race for white people. Let\u2019s face it: Many white people are clueless about race. They\u2019ve tiptoed around the issue so long they haven\u2019t given themselves a chance to deeply explore its complexity. That\u2019s why they can show up in blackface or in KKK outfits for Halloween, or as \u201cthugs\u201d at college parties, and think they are just being cool or ironic, or are even honoring black stars. And for people who\u2019d never dream of doing something like that, this new game of blackface whack-a-mole offers almost a free pass, an easy way to reassure themselves that they\u2019re on the right side of America\u2019s complex racial divide because they\u2019ve never done something so publicly stupid. It doesn\u2019t force them to look harder at their own transgressions, whatever they are\u2014or to understand why blackface is so wrong in the first place, and the deeper disadvantages blackface just throws into sharper relief.\n\nWe would do well to use Northam\u2019s photo as a starting point for a discussion on those disadvantages, starting with taking a frank look at his chosen field of work. Northam did this 35 years ago in medical school, as did some of his classmates who also became doctors. Does he know that black women are three to four times more likely to die during pregnancy and delivery than white women? Has he ever considered that an implicit bias that subtly demeans black women and dismisses their concerns about their own bodies might play a role? Has he ever urged the school that made him a doctor to consider such things, given that the school seemed to still be comfortable with future-doctors in blackface in yearbooks into the 21st century? What has he done, not only to reorient his own thinking about race, but to use his power to root out racism itself?\n\nGiven Northam\u2019s performance during a now-infamous press conference, which included a near-Moonwalk and his recollection of a different blackface episode, I doubt he has done the kind of soul-searching that should be required of every powerful person in a country that still celebrates slave-owning founders.\n\nHerring learned from Northam\u2019s political missteps and didn\u2019t dance around what he had done. \u201cI had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt was really a minimization of both people of color, and a minimization of a horrific history I knew well even then.\u201d\n\nPretty words. But what has Herring done over the past four decades to uproot racism where he had the power and influence to do so? What does he plan to do going forward? Those questions are more interesting than ones focusing on who is in the line of succession to Virginia\u2019s governorship. What role has Herring played in the drug war that has harmed or destroyed as many black families as the drugs themselves? Did he try to dismantle that system or just go along with it? Will he use this episode to re-examine how bias affects the criminal justice system at every level? How?\n\nThe young black man we are hoping to keep off death row was involved in something much worse than Northam or Herring appearing in blackface. But he is more than that one alleged horrific act. He didn\u2019t leave his mother\u2019s womb to grow up to be put on trial for murder. A confluence of factors in a country still shaped by racism helped lead him there. I\u2019m more interested in uprooting those than I am in decades-old blackface photos."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/15/trump-border-wall-national-emergency-democrats-won-analysis-225102", "text": "After a 35-day government shutdown, weeks of congressional negotiations to avoid a second shutdown and a widespread consensus among voters that the White House was to blame for it all, President Donald Trump ended up with $1.375 billion for border fencing\u2014less money than he would\u2019ve received had he avoided it all by signing the bipartisan spending bill in December.\n\nIt is clear to almost every political observer who has watched the events of the past few days unfold that on this fight, Democrats won and Trump lost.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd equally clear was that the president would try to spin this as a victory, even as he was left to declare a national emergency\u2014circumventing Congress to build his border wall. \u201cWe have so much money, we don\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d Trump said in a speech Friday in the Rose Garden. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with all the money they\u2019re giving us. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nDemocrats consciously decided to hold off on gloating until the funding bill was signed, worried that Trump could renege on the deal. Privately, though, they hadn\u2019t yet tired of all the winning.\n\nBut as a matter of both policy and strategy, is just saying \u201cno\u201d\u2014as Democrats did in these negotiations\u2014a sustainable long-term approach to dealing with Trump? Is it enough to simply block his immigration objectives, or do Democrats need to come up with an alternative policy of their own? And just what should that policy be?\n\nWe asked some of the brightest strategists and policy minds in the Democratic Party. Here\u2019s what they had to say.\n\n\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a risk of Trump being able to define the alternative\u2019\n\nCelinda Lake is a pollster and Democratic political strategist, and the president of the polling firm Lake Research Partners.\n\nFor a long time, Democrats have offered proposals for comprehensive immigration reform. It\u2019s essential that they continue to, both as a matter of policy and politics: Two-thirds of voters believe we need comprehensive reform and support a road map to citizenship, and the proposal is very popular with Latino voters and whites, each of which are important groups for Democrats to win over in 2020.\n\nHaving such a proposal also protects against many of President Trump\u2019s attacks. In the absence of a clearly defined alternative to the president, there\u2019s a risk of Trump being able to define the alternative to his own benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Stopping ill-advised policy is only the down payment\u2019 for what Dems must do next\n\nCecilia Mu\u00f1oz is vice president of New America, and served as director of the domestic policy council for President Barack Obama.\n\nIt\u2019s tremendously important for the sake of the country that Democrats demonstrate the capacity to block the president\u2019s misguided policy agenda, including his insistence on wasting billions on a wall which most of the country understands is more of a symbol than an actual border strategy. But stopping ill-advised policy is only the down payment; the bigger opportunity for Democrats is to demonstrate that what they offer the country is the capacity to govern, to bring order out of the chaos created by this president, and restore our faith that our policymakers can address our challenges effectively.\n\nThere are indeed challenges that become visible at the U.S.-Mexico border. One of these is the fact that we have a refugee crisis in our hemisphere: Instability and violence in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala is leading people to flee, either by sending their children north in the hands of smugglers, or by bringing their children north themselves. This is vastly more than a border management problem; it requires a strategy with international and domestic components, including procedures to protect the integrity of our borders while also living up to our moral and legal obligation to protect those whose lives are in danger. Democrats are right to stand in the way of the president\u2019s worst instincts. Then they must show the country that they can lead by offering policies that are both more effective and more true to our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Trump\u2019s real concern is base politics, not border security\u2019\n\nStephanie Cutter is the co-founder of Precision Strategies and was the deputy manager of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign.\n\nNo one disputes that Democrats are the champions of comprehensive immigration reform, and I expect that we\u2019ll see more on reforms for Dreamers and other issues in the near future. But thanks to the leadership and negotiating power of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Congresswomen Nita Lowey and Lucille Roybal Allard, Democrats now have the chance to make a proactive case on border security.\n\nWhy is it important for Democrats to do that? It\u2019s not just about saying no to an ineffective, costly wall that\u2019s more about President Trump\u2019s politics than actual immigration policy or border security; it\u2019s about offering a better alternative that makes record investments in smart technology, manpower, and other solutions that actually do the job of preventing illegal immigration\u2014and because it does that, exposes that Trump\u2019s real concern is base politics, not border security. Juxtapose that type of proposal with Trump, who shut down the government and bankrupted federal workers because he couldn\u2019t fulfill his promise that Mexico will pay for his wall, and who, in the end, got less for that wall than what was offered before he shut down the government in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters sent a Democratic majority to Congress for moments like this\n\nSymone D. Sanders is a Democratic strategist, CNN political commentator and former national press secretary of Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s immigration objectives are based on fear-mongering, partisanship and empty rhetoric, as opposed to facts, data and reality. The American people understand this, which is why they voted in 2018 to put a check on the president. That\u2019s what voters expect, and Democrats cannot waver on that commitment. When put in this context, one can then understand Democrats\u2019 opposition to Trump\u2019s immigration objectives as more than just a function of a divided Congress. Rather, it is why the American people sent them Washington: to hold the president accountable.\n\nDoes Congress need to work toward comprehensive immigration reform? Yes. Should Democrats lay out what that looks like from their perspective? Absolutely. But that will take months of dedicated time, as well as a real commitment from Republicans to do what\u2019s needed (as opposed to what is popular with Trump\u2019s base)\u2014and it would require a partner in President Trump, which is unlikely. It will take longer than three weeks to fix, and comprehensive immigration reform should not be conflated with Trump\u2019s campaign fantasy of a border wall. The real question is this: How are Democrats expected to negotiate one of the most complex and pressing policy issues of our time with a man whose word can\u2019t be trusted? Frankly, I think the answer is they cannot. Perhaps, comprehensive immigration reform will just have to wait for a real negotiator-in-chief.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn immigration, Dems must offer a more comprehensive vision than Hillary Clinton did in 2016\n\nStanley Greenberg is the co-founder of Democracy Corps, and a former pollster for President Bill Clinton, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Nelson Mandela.\n\nAs long as President Trump is focused on building the highest wall possible as a symbol of America repelling the dark hordes he imagines coming in caravans and hiding Muslim terrorists, opposition to Trump\u2019s policy will be front and center. That\u2019s smart politics: Our real-time dial testing on Trump\u2019s recent State of the Union speech found that voters view Trump\u2019s claims about the wall with great skepticism. His threatening talk about \u201ccaravans\u201d and a border \u201ccrisis\u201d backfired, even among white, working-class women. Literally every mention he made of the wall turned voters off, and it would be a strategic mistake for Democrats not to oppose him on this.\n\nBy and large, Democrats think the current immigration system is broken and favor comprehensive immigration reform\u2014which is a big policy that manages immigration, including elevated enforcement, expanded family and work immigration, and a path to citizenship for those who have not committed other crimes and will pay back taxes. In 2016, the problem was that Hillary Clinton and others only remembered the path for citizenship for the undocumented and the Dreamers. But as we move closer to 2020, I\u2019m sure Democratic candidates will become more articulate about how we champion our multiculturalism and manage immigration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018In the weeks ahead,\u2019 House Dems should lay the groundwork for comprehensive immigration reform\n\nNeera Tanden is president and CEO of the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that congressional Democrats emerged from this fight as the victorious party. But while Democrats in Congress were able to successfully crush the president\u2019s demands for a $5.7 billion border wall, the Trump administration\u2019s detention policies are still a disaster\u2014with officials rounding up immigrants who have lived in and contributed to our country for decades.\n\nMoving forward, Democrats in Congress should begin to lay the groundwork for comprehensive immigration reform and build a truly effective system which is consistent with our nation\u2019s values. At the core, the principal underpinning of this approach should be the rule of law. The central tenets of comprehensive reform are supported by an overwhelming majority of voters from across the political spectrum: offering an earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who already serve as an integral part of our society; making smarter and more effective investments to strengthen our borders (instead of fixating upon an absurd border wall); designing a legal immigration system that matches the needs of families, workers, and American businesses; and ensuring that people seeking asylum have a fair opportunity to receive humanitarian protection.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, this work should begin with the introduction and passage of legislation in the House that provides permanent protections for Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status holders whose lives have been thrown into chaos by this administration. Congressional Democrats should own the widespread consensus around the issue of immigration\u2014the American people stand with them, not Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorder security shouldn\u2019t mean \u2018a medieval wall from the Pacific to the Gulf\u2019\n\nBob Shrum is a longtime Democratic strategist, and the Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics at the University of Southern California.\n\nIn effect, there is a Democratic alternative to Trump\u2019s immigration policies, along the lines of the 2013 \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill from Senators McCain, Schumer, Rubio, Durbin and others: a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including the Dreamers; liberalized rules for skilled immigrants; and E-Verify to be combined with border security. (And that border security is not a medieval wall from the Pacific to the Gulf.)\n\nThis can pass the House, but not a Senate cowed by Trump, who would veto it in any event. For now, Democrats can block Trump, and that\u2019s popular. And after 2020, they can probably push through comprehensive reform, which contra-Trump, is very popular.\n\n\n\n\n\nDems must advance immigration reform \u2018that protects immigrant communities and assures their safety and dignity\u2019\n\nK. Sabeel Rahman is president of Demos, a progressive think tank.\n\nTrump\u2019s wall and approach to immigration are a direct threat to the safety and well-being of immigrant communities. Let\u2019s be clear: It\u2019s another way for this administration to attack communities of color. This is a deep fight for our values and fundamentally it is about who counts as a full member of our society. By taking a moral stance on immigration and leading with our values, progressives are winning the larger fight for an America we can be proud of. In fact, a growing number of Americans support citizenship for people who are undocumented.\n\nDemocrats should back up this fight by advancing immigration reform that protects immigrant communities and assures their safety and dignity. This includes a direct, fair, and inclusive road to citizenship for immigrants without papers and provisions to ensure that undocumented immigrants are treated with respect and dignity by their employers and by law enforcement. Reforms must also be enacted to assure ICE and CBP accountability for atrocities like the family separation crisis, and which end the practice of arbitrary raids, prosecution, and harassment of communities of color under the guise of immigration enforcement. When all immigrants have full and equal rights, we will finally have an immigration system based on fairness and that upholds true American values.\n\nThis article tagged under: Immigration\n\nDemocratic Party\n\nPolitics"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/14/trump-national-emergency-border-precedent-225055", "text": "Mark Wilson/Getty Images Soapbox Trump\u2019s National Emergency Is Great News for Future President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez The president\u2019s latest decision will backfire on conservatives.\n\nMatt Latimer is a former speechwriter for President George W.

He is currently a co-partner in Javelin, a literary agency and communications firm based in Alexandria, and contributing editor at Politico Magazine.\n\nI hope President Donald Trump and his short-sighted supporters have been enjoying the fun they\u2019ve had at the Green New Deal\u2019s expense. Unfortunately for them, the president\u2019s plan to declare a national emergency, which the White House announced Thursday and which could allow Trump to build his wall without congressional approval, may have just made a Green New Deal inevitable in 2021\u2014or whenever he\u2019s out of the White House.\n\nBy now, we\u2019ve all become numb, alarmingly so, to the nutty ideas the president of the United States has floated or in some cases enacted to undermine the basic norms of our democratic institutions: firing FBI personnel on various pretexts, discounting election results he doesn\u2019t like, befriending vicious dictators, claiming judges are biased based on their ethnicity, alleging massive voter fraud without evidence, ignoring intelligence findings he doesn\u2019t agree with, and on and on and on. But as bizarre and dangerous as these have been, his plan to declare a national emergency is by far the absolute worst.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nShame on any \u201cconservatives\u201d who roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders and let him take this path because they are sick of arguing with him. (You know who you are.) This is going to backfire on them in a major way\u2014and the tragedy is that every one of them knows this. The core of conservatism has always been a distrust of a powerful national government and the necessity of imposing restraints on it. That\u2019s out the window now, like nearly every other tenet that held the movement together.\n\nI used to laugh when my more progressive friends warned me that Trump wanted to turn America into a third-world banana republic. He\u2019d never pull that off, I\u2019d tell them. The Constitution will stop him. Members of Congress will stop him. The GOP will stop him. Now, I\u2019m the one who is the fool. I\u2019ve tried very hard to restrain myself from frantic pronouncements, but this national emergency declaration is the closest my friends have ever come to seeing their worst fears realized. Is there any other way to see it?\n\nThe notion that a president of the United States can simply circumvent the national legislature out of pique, declare something that has been going on for years as an \u201cemergency,\u201d and then implement policies our elected representatives did not vote for, allocate money for or in any other way authorize is totally antithetical to representative democracy and the checks and balances system. If Trump is correct constitutionally, which he isn\u2019t, then what did the Founders create a Congress for in the first place? I\u2019d like to think that the Supreme Court will call a stop to this nonsense in a 9-0 decision, as they did in 1974 when they forced the executive branch to turn over to Congress tapes of President Richard Nixon\u2019s private conversations. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve lost so much faith in conservatives\u2019 ability to draw any red line against Trump that I find it easy to believe that the conservative majority of the court will go along with this, anyway. As a result, Congress will no longer matter. As a result, the Supreme Court will no longer matter, either.\n\nYou would think that a president of the United States would care about the long-term threats his actions might have on our democracy. But obviously Trump\u2014a man who reportedly said that amassing more crippling debt doesn\u2019t matter because he\u2019ll be out of office when we have to deal with it\u2014doesn\u2019t care about any of this. Obviously, the Republican Congress is too scared of their own voters to care about that. But here\u2019s what they should care about: They are making their most vivid, frenzied nightmare come true.\n\nFor a decade now, the right has warned about a progressive \u201cdictator\u201d like Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton forcing the United States to pursue policies that the majority does not want. Now they are making it so much easier for the next Democratic president to do exactly that. Shortly after learning of Trump\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency to build his beloved border wall, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said a left-wing president might just as well declare an emergency to impose any policies they want, too. As Elizabeth Warren tweeted: \u201cGun violence is an emergency. Climate change is an emergency. Our country's opioid epidemic is an emergency.\u201d You see where this is headed.\n\nBut maybe I\u2019m missing something. Maybe Trump has a plan to stop all of this, too. Maybe we are only a couple of months away from Trump donning a scary robe, declaring another \u201cemergency\u201d and postponing the 2020 elections. If Emperor Palpatine can do something like that, why can\u2019t he? Is there anyone with the courage to stop him? We will find that out very shortly.

They didn\u2019t go to the vigils; they didn\u2019t watch the CNN town hall on U.S. gun policy; they couldn\u2019t even go to work. \u201cWe were just trying to get through a normal day, trying to get out of bed,\u201d April told me when I spoke to her over the phone in January.\n\nBy late March, they had come to see things differently. They started paying more attention to the news and tracking everything that had gone wrong to cause their daughter\u2019s death. And, as survivors of the massacre that killed 13 other students and three staff members fought to combat gun violence across the country, staging rallies and urging legislators to pass gun reform legislation, April and Phil fought back, too, steadfastly demanding change at home in the School District that failed to keep their daughter safe.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThey lobbied district officials to change security protocols. They demanded full explanations and apologies from the Broward superintendent and the MSD principal. They wanted Broward Sheriff Scott Israel removed from his post. April, who was an elementary school principal in Broward at the time of the shooting, even accepted a job as director of school safety and security for the district.\n\nOne year later, the Parkland student activists who captured the nation\u2019s attention have gotten results. They organized the dozens of March for Our Lives protests around the world that attracted millions of activists. Last March, Rick Scott\u2014then Florida\u2019s governor and now a U.S. senator\u2014signed into law the state\u2019s most sweeping gun reform legislation in recent memory.\n\nBut where the Parkland activists met with success on the state level, April and Phil say they have been blocked in their district. So far, no one has issued what they consider a satisfying apology for the February 14 massacre. Sheriff Israel was removed from his post last month, but he is challenging the decision in the state Legislature. When April tried to make meaningful changes in safety procedures in her new job, she found herself entirely left out of the decision-making process and frustrated by the slow pace of reform. April even described how district officials made her jump through hoops just to take appropriate time off to mourn her daughter.\n\n\u201cThat was something we just didn\u2019t imagine,\u201d April told me, \u201cthat we\u2019d have to fight this hard, or as hard as we are, to try to just make things OK.\u201d\n\nApril and Phil say they eventually realized they couldn\u2019t trust district officials to avoid a repeat of last year\u2019s tragedy. And, with their other daughter, Evelyn, still in high school, they couldn\u2019t take any chances. So, when the school year started in August, the three of them moved to Seattle (their son, Robert, is a college student in Florida). They\u2019d tried to make something good come from what April calls \u201cour tragedy.\u201d But if trying their hardest wasn\u2019t enough, the only option left was starting over.\n\nEven on the other side of the country, the Schentrups are still haunted by the sense that had officials done things differently before February 14, Carmen would still be alive. They pored over all 458 pages of last month\u2019s report from the MSD Public Safety Commission, an investigative body created last March by the Florida Legislature to find out what happened and make recommendations for the future. The report gave an excruciatingly detailed, second-by-second account of the massacre that killed Carmen and of the decisions that allowed it to happen. The Schentrups found some comfort in the fact that the report\u2019s conclusions were similar to their own: that the School District and the Sheriff\u2019s Office, among other organizations, were inadequately prepared to protect students\u2019 lives at MSD.\n\nTop: Fire rescue vehicles block the road to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, following the shooting.

Even if it\u2019s only starting to happen almost a year later, that\u2019s still something. \u201cThe fact that the commission really looked into [everything] was a good thing,\u201d April said. But the same people are still at the top in the school district\u2014the principal and the superintendent\u2014even when, according to the Schentrups, they haven\u2019t seriously admitted their failure and offered explanations of future plans. Phil put it simply: \u201cHow did their policies fail before, and how have they changed those policies to ensure that people are doing the right things?\u201d A year later, he said, April and Phil still don\u2019t have the most difficult answers.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the frustration,\u201d April added. A year after Carmen was murdered, \u201cthere\u2019s no answers to our questions.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nAs Valentine\u2019s Day came to a close last year, the Schentrups waited at a Marriott hotel with the frantic families and friends of the MSD students and faculty members who were still unaccounted for. At 2 a.m., some FBI officials arrived to tell April and Phil the news they had been dreading for hours. One member of the school board was there that night, too. \u201cI remember telling her that I just wanted to know what happened,\u201d April told me. \u201cAt the time I was just thinking about Evelyn, to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again with Evelyn or at MSD.\u201d The school board member told April she\u2019d do what she could to find out what had taken place.\n\nApril didn\u2019t hear from her again for almost three months, until she and Phil signed up to speak at a school board meeting in May. The school board member called April the next day. \u201cI thought the timing was ironic,\u201d April said. This lack of empathy, or even consideration, would become familiar.\n\nFor April, unlike most family members of MSD victims, interaction with the Broward Schools administration and the school board did not begin on February 14, 2018. She had worked for the district since moving to South Florida in 1998: first as a teacher, then as an assistant principal, and finally as a principal at Pembroke Pines Elementary, a position she held for seven years. After Carmen\u2019s death, April received an outpouring of support from teachers and colleagues at her school. But she felt that the district didn\u2019t extend the same warmth and flexibility. \u201cFrom an employee point of view, it was frustrating,\u201d she explained. The district gave her one day of bereavement leave to mourn her daughter. She had to get creative with how to take time off to properly grieve; she took a part-time medical leave, meaning she still had to go to school a couple days a week.\n\nLeft: The front door of the Schentrup family\u2019s home in Bellevue, WA. Right: Portraits and various items commemorating Carmen Schentrup\u2019s life sit in the family living room underneath the TV set. | Chona Kasinger for Politico Magazine\n\nOn Easter Sunday, April found out that the teachers at MSD were given as much time off as they needed, with no requirement to use up sick days or accrued time off. \u201cI wasn\u2019t told or given that option,\u201d April said. It wasn\u2019t until her boss took the matter to district administrators and asked them to fix it that April got her vacation days back. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think that I would have to work so hard to secure the same treatment as the other teachers who were at the school,\u201d April said.\n\nSecuring leave turned out to be the least of April\u2019s troubles. When Evelyn wanted to return to MSD with her friends when the school reopened two weeks after the shooting, April and Phil didn\u2019t object. But that all changed when they started to re-enter the world and sort through the horror stories of what went wrong the day Carmen was killed. \u201cThe more we learned about all the things that led up to Carmen\u2019s death, it was a lot harder to send Evelyn back to school, and a lot harder for her to want to go back to school,\u201d April said.\n\nThe most painful detail\u2014the moment the shooter walked onto campus\u2014still plays on an endless loop in their heads. All schools in Broward are supposed to have a \u201csingle point of entry,\u201d meaning just one open gate that is monitored by a staff member at all times during the school day. April knew this; she\u2019d been doing it for years at her elementary school. \u201cI just assumed that every school was doing it,\u201d she told me.\n\nOn the day of the shooting, Nikolas Cruz stepped out of an Uber, rifle bag in hand, and easily entered the school through an open, unguarded gate. To prepare for afternoon dismissal, school security monitor Andrew Medina had opened that gate, which was supposed to remained locked until school was dismissed, half an hour early.\n\nDemanding accountability on this point has become something of an obsession for the Schentrups. \u201cMSD literally opened their gates, left them unmonitored, and let a shooter walk on campus unimpeded, walk through unlocked doors unimpeded, unpack his firearm unimpeded, and go and murder 17 people,\u201d Phil said. The massacre took all of eight minutes, after which the shooter simply dropped his weapons and fled with the other students evacuating the school. \u201cYou can spend money up the wazoo to secure schools, but MSD had everything it needed to keep Nikolas Cruz off campus,\u201d Phil added.\n\nCouple that with Medina\u2019s admission to investigators that he had recognized Cruz when he passed him on campus that day but did nothing to stop him and didn\u2019t put the school on lockdown: \u201cI knew who the kid was. \u2026 We had a meeting about him last year and we said, \u2018If there\u2019s gonna be anybody who\u2019s gonna come to this school and shoot this school up, it\u2019s gonna be that kid.\u2019\u201d Medina remained in his post through the end of the school year last June, when public pressure led to his dismissal. Medina became the first district employee to be fired after the shooting.\n\nA handful of others also faced consequences relating to their actions on February 14, including several police officers who have been reassigned to new posts or forced into early retirement. But Principal Ty Thompson and Superintendent Robert Runcie remain in their posts.\n\nSome Parkland families, including the Schentrups, want Runcie out. Thompson, though, is more popular in the district; many MSD families and community members have praised him for helping the community heal in the wake of the shooting. But April and Phil don\u2019t see it that way. They have criticized Thompson for failing to maintain a single point of entry and allowing the school\u2019s gates to remain open and unmonitored before the end of the school day.\n\nBroward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie speaks to the media at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on the first day of school on August 15, 2018 in Parkland, Florida. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nPhil recounted a conversation he had with Thompson after the shooting, when the principal told Phil that it was common practice for all high schools to open the gates earlier to make dismissal easier. Phil doesn\u2019t care; because of the decision to allow the gates to unlock early, 17 people died. \u201c[Thompson] gambled with my daughter\u2019s life,\u201d Phil said. \u201cMy daughter lost her life. He\u2019s become a hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talk about accountability, but really you just want people to stop lying to you,\u201d Phil explained. \u201cYou want people to stop hiding the truth and playing games with you.\u201c\n\nA Broward County Public Schools spokesperson did not comment on any of April or Phil\u2019s claims. \u201cOur District remains committed to providing support for our students, staff, families and communities as we continue to heal,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn July, Runcie created a position for April: director of school safety and security for Broward County Public Schools. Her first priority was oversight, which involved clarifying expectations for administrators at the district\u2019s 234 schools and putting a system in place to enforce security protocols. But when April suggested including principals in conversations about what actually works safety-wise, she was ignored. When she asked the district\u2019s head of facilities for a list of schools without a single point of entry, she was told that list didn\u2019t exist\u2014and she\u2019d have to drive to all the schools to see for herself. She watched the district decide, without consulting her, to pay a school safety consulting firm $900,000 to do an independent investigation.\n\nApril realized her job was a \u201cfake role,\u201d designed to \u201cplacate\u201d her, as she put it, when she sat down at a meeting with assistant principals just before the start of the school year, and they all had copies of a memo she\u2019d never seen that detailed new security guidelines and plans. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even part of the conversation,\u201d April said. As she saw it, the district\u2019s decision not to consider many of her recommendations fit with what she recognized as a pattern: a willingness to neglect other opinions when they strayed from what the district wanted.\n\nA few months before April started her new job, Florida had passed sweeping new gun control legislation that, among other things, raised the minimum age for firearm purchases to 21 and instituted a three-day waiting period. It also included numerous provisions to address school safety deficiencies and support mental health programs.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Emma Gonzalez, center, listens during the March for Our Lives Rally in Washington, DC on March 24, 2018. | Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSome parts of the law required the state\u2019s school districts to make changes themselves. April thought that an important part of her new role would be overseeing how Broward followed through on the law\u2019s safety reforms. She had some experience in the field: After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, she became vigilant in tightening security at her school.\n\nBut when she got to her post, April says she found the district wasn\u2019t serious about putting these reforms in place quickly, before the start of the new school year in August. One example is the requirement, from the March bill, that each district have an app with which students and staff can anonymously report questionable or problematic behavior. The MSD shooter was a former student with a history of disciplinary problems and run-ins with school officials. After the shooting it became clear that in this, too, the district had failed, by not properly heeding the numerous warnings about Cruz and by opting not to report several campus crimes.\n\nBecause officials couldn\u2019t agree on which app to use, students returned to school with no outlet to register concerns or fears. \u201cSomething as simple as that\u2014it just feels like a lot of dragging their feet,\u201d April said.\n\nThere were other decisions April saw as red flags. Runcie announced in March that he was considering installing metal detectors at MSD, and later committed to that plan before walking it back in early August. \u201cWhen I looked into it, no one had really started the pre-work on looking into how to install metal detectors,\u201d April told me. \u201cIt just felt like there was no sense of urgency on anything.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not an environment into which she wanted to send Evelyn, who started 10th grade in August. \u201cThat\u2019s difficult\u2014knowing that the same people that failed one daughter are still in charge of the other,\u201d April said. So, when Evelyn started 10th grade in August, it wasn\u2019t at MSD.\n\n\n\n***\n\nTop: A photo of Carmen and some family members sits in the Schentrup living room. Bottom: Philip and April Schentrup clasp hands wearing bracelets that say \u201cSchentrup strong\u201d along with Carmen\u2019s name and day she died. | Chona Kasinger for Politico Magazine\n\nThe family chose to move to Seattle because Phil\u2019s company is based there and he traveled there often from Florida. Still, the move was \u201cpainful,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI would summarize this whole mess by saying: April and I are just left with a lot of bad choices ... a struggle if we stay, a struggle if we move there.\u201d But it was never really a question. \u201cKnowing what we know, it\u2019s very hard, in good conscience, to send our daughter back to a school run by people who have a history of failure,\u201d Phil told me just before they moved last fall.\n\nPhil isn\u2019t shy about telling those people he has a problem with how they\u2019ve handled things. Phil told me that Superintendent Runcie visited the Schentrups at their Parkland home a week or two after the shooting. Phil said he told Runcie that day to \u201cbe the hero,\u201d to find out what went wrong and fix it. But a couple months later, when Phil and April sat down with Runcie to talk about moving forward, he continued to tell them he still didn\u2019t know all that had gone wrong leading up to the shooting, Phil recounted. \u201cTo plead ignorance in the worst tragedy that\u2019s ever befallen Broward County ... seems in my mind irresponsible and reckless,\u201d Phil told me. \u201cHow can you not know? How was that not the thing you wanted go look into the day after?\u201d\n\nThere has been some accountability, even if it is not exactly what Phil and April hoped for. The armed police officer who was stationed at the school and hid for nearly 50 minutes after he heard gunshots no longer works for the Sheriff\u2019s Office (he went into early retirement and receives a hefty pension from the state). Then there\u2019s Medina, and another security monitor who hid in a closet; both were fired in June. The school\u2019s head of security remained in that position until he was reassigned to an administrative post three months into the school year. Among the other six Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies who arrived on the scene and did nothing, all have been either reassigned or are currently under investigation.\n\nMost of these changes are recent, stemming from the commission\u2019s January report. The report unequivocally and painstakingly details scores of failures related to the MSD attack: the school safety protocols at MSD that teachers either did not know about or that simply did not exist; the FBI\u2019s bungled handling of tips about the alleged shooter; the school district\u2019s inaccurate reporting of disciplinary problems, including by the alleged shooter; the Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s misguided active shooter response policies; and much more. The report also offers recommendations for improvement.\n\n\u201cMaybe 11 months is better than never,\u201d Phil said, when I spoke with him in January. But even that feels too long. \u201cThe apathy of the people who we as taxpayers and citizens expect to address things is unbelievable, unimaginable until you have to deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe biggest change came last month, when Florida\u2019s new Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, visited Parkland to publicly remove Broward Sheriff Scott Israel from his post. (Israel is challenging his suspension in the Florida Legislature.) For months he had faced a public outcry objecting to his leadership, including from most of the victims\u2019 families and from a prominent police union, which sponsored a billboard along I-95 that read, \u201cThere is no confidence in Sheriff Israel.\u201d Israel jumbled the facts when he spoke to the state public safety commission. Critics said he failed to train officers on proper responses to an active shooter situation. Many of the problems that emerged on and after February 14 had first become apparent and gone unaddressed over a year earlier, when a mass shooting killed five people at the Fort Lauderdale airport.\n\nNevertheless, Israel told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper last spring that he has \u201cgiven amazing leadership to this agency,\u201d and repeatedly defended his handling of both the MSD attack and the airport shooting. \u201cI\u2019m glad DeSantis removed Israel,\u201d Phil said. \u201cHis failure before and after the shootings at the airport, MSD and other instances are astounding.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough for the Schentrups. It\u2019s worth wondering whether anything will be enough for them. Nothing\u2014not a full-throated apology from the school board members, the superintendent and principal, nor the firing of everyone in charge\u2014can change the fact that lots of things did go wrong on February 14, and as a result, the Schentrups\u2019 oldest daughter never got to turn 17.\n\nI met April at a bar in Washington, D.C., to watch President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address in early February. She stood in the back of the crowded bar with Debbi Hixon, whose husband Chris, MSD\u2019s football coach, had been killed at the school trying to disarm the shooter; and Jennifer Montalto, whose 14-year-old daughter Gina was also killed that day. They wore T-shirts that said \u201cStand with Parkland,\u201d the name of an advocacy group they started last summer with the relatives of the other MSD victims. Among the dozens of slightly intoxicated young people who shouted at Trump as he spoke, the three women from Parkland looked out of place.\n\nWe settled in on the bar\u2019s third floor. A group of activists from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence handed out \u201cState of the Union bingo\u201d cards, with keywords that people could mark if Trump mentioned them in his speech. He got to some of the words quickly: \u201cChina,\u201d \u201ccaravan,\u201d \u201ctariff.\u201d April, Debbi and Jennifer watched for an almost an hour-and-a-half as Trump made no mention of their cause. \u201cBackground checks\u201d and \u201cgun violence\u201d remained uncovered. No one got bingo that night.\n\nThe portrait from Carmen Schentrup\u2019s funeral sits in a corner of a lower floor in the Schentrup family\u2019s Bellevue home. | Chona Kasinger for Politico Magazine\n\n\u201cHe completely avoided the gun issue,\u201d April said, shaking her head. We left the bar and walked to Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, as if she were in Washington for a normal trip. She wore a button that read \u201cMay the Force Be With You\u201d over a picture of Carmen\u2019s face. On my way out, she handed me a rubber bracelet with Carmen\u2019s name and the dates of her birth and death.\n\nBack in Seattle, the Schentrups are now trying to approach the anniversary of the tragedy like any other day. \u201cIt\u2019s not like just February 14 is a day without Carmen. Every day is a day without Carmen,\u201d April told me. She paused. \u201cI no longer see February 14th as Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d Of all the things that we\u2019d discussed\u2014the people she thinks failed Carmen, her fear of Evelyn returning to MSD, the godforsaken single point of entry\u2014this was what made her cry.\n\nWhat\u2019s hardest to accept is the nagging reality that everyone will, one day, move on. \u201cPeople have been supportive, but they have their own lives,\u201d Phil said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to deal with their problems, and it\u2019s hard to maintain focus.\u201d A year has passed, and the community hasn\u2019t tired yet. But Phil knows the day will come. \u201cEverybody\u2019s just waiting for people to tire out, and their whole strategy is to do nothing. And that\u2019s the most frustrating part \u2026 because as a parent all you want them to do is something.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Florida\n\nGuns\n\nFeature"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/tag/feature", "text": "FEATURE\n\nThe ultra-Orthodox in Israel are allowed to live by their own rules.

He\u2019s been in elected politics his entire adult life, and although he\u2019s been willing to go his own way \u2014 he voted against the Defense of Marriage Act in the 1990s when that wasn\u2019t popular \u2014 he\u2019s pragmatic enough not to get carried away with wild enthusiasms.\n\nHe\u2019s managed to thrive in an increasingly red state. In 2016, Donald Trump won Ohio. In an otherwise nightmarish midterm in 2018, Republicans won every statewide race, except against Brown who secured a third term. Ohio is not Alabama, but it\u2019s not New York or California either, states where a Democratic can discount any need to appeal to culturally conservative voters.\n\nFinally, Brown\u2019s base is unions that have no patience for pie-in-the-sky environmental schemes that threaten their jobs, or radical schemes to overturn current health care arrangements, when many of them have gold-plated plans they want to protect.\n\nAll of this means that Brown has the sense to steer clear of proposals that will almost certainly diminish a Democrat\u2019s chances of beating Trump.\n\nOn paper, Brown looks like a strong general election candidate, and not just because he\u2019s avoiding ridiculous excesses.\n\nThe natural play for Democrats in 2020 would be to nominate someone, like Brown, who has a good chance of winning back the Blue Wall states and therefore putting away the election (barring some unforeseen event that opens up Hillary states to Trump).\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Brown would have won against Trump in 2016. He has a much stronger connection to working-class voters than Hillary Clinton, and never would have dismissed them or the Upper Midwest. He came up in politics hanging out in union halls, and warns against coastal condescension toward the Midwest.\n\nBrown can claim some measure of vindication with the rise of Trump. It has moved the center of gravity of American politics in his direction. The senator was a voice in the wilderness on globalization, and now there\u2019s a Republican president who makes much the same critiques and has brought his party \u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 around with him.\n\nBrown\u2019s economic populism is no longer an outlier. Instead, the point of contention is whether Trump or Brown represents the best version. Brown believes Democrats shouldn\u2019t \u201cshy away from populism because Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump and Steve Bannon get called \u2018populists.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe question, at the same time, is whether the Democratic Party has been moving beyond Brown and his style of politics. The left\u2019s disdain for working-class whites has, if anything, grown over the first two years of the Trump presidency. And as Ron Brownstein pointed out in a recent analysis for CNN, noncollege whites are becoming a less important part of the Democratic Party, while the influence of college-educated and African-American women grows.\n\nLike Bernie Sanders, Brown will have the disadvantage of being a white male more interested in class rather than racial politics, at a time when the most vocal part of the party\u2019s base is obsessed with intersectionality.\n\nPart of Brown\u2019s calculation has to be that he can leave the crowded left-most lane in the primary to others. And, so, yes, it has come to this: In the inflamed, #resistance-driven contemporary Democratic Party, Sherrod Brown is a voice of relative moderation.\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under: Sherrod Brown\n\nOhio"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/01/kamala-harris-porn-california-attorney-general-facebook-twitter-silicon-valley-224534", "text": "Nancy Scola is a reporter covering technology for POLITICO Pro.\n\nThe San Francisco office of California\u2019s Department of Justice occupies a 14-story tower amid what might be the most formidable density of high-tech money and power in the world. The top floor looks across to Twitter\u2019s headquarters, just five blocks away; Facebook is 30 miles down the peninsula in Silicon Valley; and Google not far beyond that.\n\nOn the afternoon of February 4, 2015, executives from those companies, as well as Microsoft and other online giants, filed through the building\u2019s doors and into a distinctly unglamorous, windowless below-ground room. They sat in rows. The companies there had made hundreds of billions of dollars collectively during the freewheeling internet boom of the aughts and 2010s, and they weren\u2019t accustomed to being summoned by local law enforcement. If anything, politicians were usually eager to catch a bit of their reflected glamour. President Barack Obama had dined with high-tech CEOs and invited industry leaders to the White House for advice; Hillary Clinton, then preparing her 2016 White House bid, was making speeches in Silicon Valley.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut as the internet had become a central part of American life, and as social media exploded as a force, concerns were growing that something was going uncontrollably wrong. Just months earlier, a hacker breaking into iCloud had stolen and published the private photographs of a sweeping collection of female celebrities, including the actresses Gabrielle Union, Kirsten Dunst and Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence, the 24-year-old \u201cHunger Games\u201d star, called the experience a \u201csex crime.\u201d And while those stars could afford lawyers and PR experts to fight such a violation, there were uncounted women, and some men, who struggled to reel back horrifying photos of themselves once posted online.\n\nAlongside the tech executives in that room sat lawyers for victims and experts on online harassment. At the head of the group was the person who had brought them all here: the state attorney general, a career public prosecutor named Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris had built much of her career looking out for victims of exploitation, whether that was child abuse or sex trafficking. She had been looking into so-called \u201crevenge porn\u201d for months. And now, as a prosecutor with the full power of California\u2019s legal infrastructure behind her, she had a plan to change the way this online crime was policed. Observers tended to focus on the malicious hackers who broke into accounts and posted them on big national platforms. But Harris had begun to see the real issue as the platforms themselves.\n\nThe meeting was closed to the press, and no transcript has been released. But the message was clear, says Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor who was present: This was a serious crime, and it needed to be stopped.\n\nFirst, don\u2019t call it revenge porn. It\u2019s not, said Harris to start the meeting, recalls Citron.\n\nHarris made the point that this had nothing to do with love affairs gone wrong, and it wasn\u2019t online mischief. It wasn\u2019t even about sex, really. It was a crime, the way domestic abuse was a crime. Said Harris, as Citron remembers it, People do it to torment people. They do it to make money. And to call it pornography is to misunderstand the problem, because there\u2019s no consent, It\u2019s \u201ccyber exploitation,\u201d and let me tell you how it ruins lives.\n\nTo Citron, who had been working for years to push this exact issue into the public conversation, it felt like a watershed. She draws a parallel to domestic violence and workplace harassment, serious offenses that were once seen more lightly and largely ignored. Here was the self-described \u201ctop cop\u201d in all of California \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest state and the geographical center of the global tech industry \u2014 making the decision that these were crimes, and uniquely devastating crimes. This meeting was a shot across Silicon Valley\u2019s bow.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t threaten to prosecute the companies, or even flex the considerable muscles she had as AG, but there\u2019s no question the message got through. The next month, Twitter banned nonconsensual intimate photos and videos from its service. That summer, Google began stripping explicit photos from its search results at victims\u2019 request. Next, Microsoft said it would block links to intimate content on its Xbox Live gaming service.\n\n\u201cI cannot emphasize enough how leaders in technology have stepped up,\u201d said Harris during a news conference on cyber exploitation in October of that same year. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting any of them were happy to get a call from the AG saying, \u2018Come in, we want to talk with you.\u2018 But they all did. They did.\u201d\n\nHarris won a U.S. Senate seat the next year, and launched her presidential campaign last weekend with a rally in Oakland.\n\nBut all has not been kumbaya with the tech industry. Harris didn't go after Facebook or Google directly, but she did launch two high-profile prosecutions for online sexual exploitation, and her aggressive legal tactics\u2014peeling away the legal protections that insulate online platforms from the content they host\u2014have gotten her sideways with many people in her state\u2019s most important industry. Mike Masnick, who writes the influential blog Techdirt and has emerged as a critic, worries that Harris\u2019 approach threatens to destroy an online ecosystem that, despite its problems, has produced a flourishing of ideas and tools and human connections. \u201cIt\u2019s something of a populist position,\u201d he says of Harris\u2019 legal push, \u201cbut I fear where that populist position ends up undermining the internet as we know and love it.\u201d (Harris, through a spokesperson, declined repeated requests for an interview.)\n\nHarris through the years. | Flickr, AP, Getty Images\n\nNow, with the downside of technology again at the center of the national conversation, Harris is almost uniquely positioned among the presidential candidates to understand some of the thorniest issues that face the country on this front, and how government might tackle them. But in the Senate she has been largely quiet. When Congress took up an internet-policing bill closely connected to her own legal work, she barely played a role, and in fact initially refused to sign on.\n\nWhy is she sitting it out? Harris has burst quickly onto the national stage; she currently polls behind only Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders among Democrats as a likely challenger to Donald Trump in 2020. Her legal fight against online harassment is one of her most innovative, and least-understood, contributions to public policy. But it\u2019s also potentially toxic with important Democratic constituencies. Harris, by all accounts, is unfazed by such concerns. In her inaugural address as attorney general of California, in 2011, she quoted someone who\u2019d also once held that job: Earl Warren, who later became chief justice of the United States. Said Harris with a laugh, \u201cEverything I did in my life that was worthwhile I caught hell for.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nAt 54, Harris is a member of the exact cohort of Americans whose careers grew alongside the Internet itself. The year she graduated from Howard University, in 1986, her college yearbook reported that personal computers were becoming a campus \u201cmainstay,\u201d though one professor warned students to save their $3,000 unless they really had a need for one. Howard at the time was linked to five other historically black colleges on a small network; the professor running the project expressed his aspiration to one day connect it to ARPANET, the Defense Department network that within a few years would evolve into what we know as the Internet.\n\nAs Harris moved up the legal ladder \u2014 a law degree at the University of California\u2019s Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco; jobs with the Alameda County district attorney and the San Francisco city attorney \u2014 the Internet was growing, too. With it came a spirited debate over what laws should apply to this new realm of civic activity. With the rise of the web, more people began to shift their lives online, and thinkers and philosophers began to stake out this new territory as a special place requiring special protections. In 1996, one of the foundational texts of that debate arrived on the scene: techno-libertarian thinker John Perry Barlow\u2019s \u201cThe Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,\u201d which would quickly go what would later be called viral:\n\n\u201cGovernments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind,\u201d it began. \u201cOn behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.\u201d\n\nAs sententious as the wording was (in an interview, Barlow would later tell me that he was drunk when he wrote it), it was responding to a very concrete concern. The day Barlow released it, President Bill Clinton signed the Telecommunications Act into law \u2014 an attempt both to boost the commercial potential of the nascent internet and to tame it. Buried in the Telecommunications Act was a bill called the Communications Decency Act, which made it a federal crime to use the internet to spread \u201cpatently offensive\u201d sexual or otherwise graphic content, or push obscene content to minors. Its supporters said this was only necessary to protect children from the excesses of this new medium. (Its champion, Nebraska Democrat James Exon, said on the Senate floor: \u201cThe information superhighway should not become a red-light district.\u201d) Barlow and its opponents were horrified: It was as though in this important new digital landscape, the Constitution's free-speech protections suddenly didn\u2019t apply.\n\nIn the years to follow, Barlow and his ilk were ascendant. The Supreme Court struck down major parts of the Communications Decency Act on First Amendment grounds, and other courts did away with much of the rest. It was the techno-libertarians, not the techno-skeptics, who would set the tone for a more freewheeling conception of online life \u2014 one that would come to be a bigger sector of the economy than even they might have imagined.\n\nHarris pursued a sprawling set of cases as a public prosecutor in the 1990s and 2000s, from homicides to drug dealing to crimes targeting LGBT people, and developed a reputation as a tough lawyer. \u201cAs a career prosecutor,\u201d Harris wrote in her 2010 book Smart on Crime, \u201cI believe that nothing is more important than how we choose to keep ourselves, our families, and each other safe.\u201d In speeches about her inspiration, she quotes civil rights leaders like Cesar Chavez and Fannie Lou Hamer. \u201cMy sister, Maya, and I joke we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice,\u201d she has said more than once.\n\nMuch of her work as a prosecutor had little to do with technology. But by the time she ran for attorney general of California in 2010, it had become clear that the internet was not just a commercial bonanza, but also a hyper-efficient mechanism for personal harm, whether by allowing online harassment, or facilitating the easy buying, selling and renting of women, girls, and occasionally men. She won the election; among the challengers she beat was Facebook\u2019s former top lawyer. And it was clear that tech was now in her sights. When she delivered her inaugural remarks on the steps of a Sacramento History Museum, it wasn\u2019t much more than a hundred words into the speech that she promised to protect Californians from \u201conline predators.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 focus on technology was fairly novel. It was only three years earlier that Steve Jobs, by then Apple\u2019s CEO, had stood on stage at downtown San Francisco\u2019s Moscone Center to announce the first iPhone, saying what with hindsight was justifiable bravado, \u201cApple is going to reinvent the phone.\u201d When Harris took office, law enforcement across the country was still struggling to figure out how this ubiquitous new version of the online world would change their jobs. \u201cWe quickly realized that everyone who was arrested was arrested with a smartphone. It didn\u2019t matter what the crime was,\u201d says Travis LeBlanc, then a special assistant attorney general and senior adviser to Harris.\n\nBut while the technology was new, say those close to Harris, the new state attorney general realized the crimes it enabled were old and familiar ones. In 2012, Harris issued a 134-page report called \u201cThe State of Human Trafficking in California,\u201d and the role of technology figured prominently. Harris has called trafficking \u201cmodern day slavery,\u201d and in the report she said that the internet was making it worse, with perpetrators now using social media, online marketplaces, and other digital tools to both find and sell victims, often anonymously. The situation, wrote Harris, was \u201catrocious.\u201d\n\nHarris was uniquely poised to do something about it. She had a sprawling department of more than 4,000 workers and a budget of over $800 million, and she had a powerful legal tool in California\u2019s Constitution, which, unlike the U.S. Constitution, includes an explicit right to privacy.\n\nWhen it came to technology, she took a multiprong approach, and one that often roamed far afield from the courtroom. She engaged in what she likes to call \u201cconvenings\u201d with tech companies, in sessions like the 2015 basement meeting. She pushed for legislation to expand local officials\u2019 ability to prosecute cybercrimes in which either victim or perpetrators lived outside their home district. If that approach to the job sounds exhausting, her staff agrees: \u201cShe wants to solve every single problem out there, the world\u2019s biggest problems,\u201d LeBlanc told me. \u201cAnd there are obviously only 24 hours in a day. She\u2019s only one person. Her staff are [each] only one person.\u201d\n\nIn trying to push Silicon Valley firms to change their behavior, Harris borrowed from a civil-rights tactic called \u201cinterest convergence theory,\u201d which holds that advocates make progress when they can show how their causes align with the self-interest of those in power. Tech companies should want to make their websites and platforms safer, her argument went, because people who feel unsafe will leave them. That hurts corporate bottom lines.\n\nIf that appeal to self-interest failed, she made it clear she was also willing to play a more traditional game: \u201cI\u2019m very well aware that I have a carrot and a stick,\u201d Harris has said. \u201cI prefer to start with the carrot. But I\u2019m also prepared to use the stick.\u201d\n\nAs Harris\u2019 push gained momentum, she began triggering criticism that she was running roughshod over some fundamental rights, including free speech. One case involved a bill she\u2019d sponsored just before taking office as attorney general, when she was San Francisco\u2019s district attorney. Harris pushed to ban registered sex offenders from using any social media sites. Though the idea might have seemed like a smart way to stop online predators, it\u2019s also of questionable legality. \u201cIt\u2019s the type of thing that might get you some votes, but that will also get you a constitutional challenge,\u201d says Chris Hoofnagle, a professor of internet law at the University of California at Berkeley. The bill did not pass. (The U.S. Supreme Court would in 2017 strike down a similar North Carolina ban; Justice Anthony Kennedy, a civil-libertarian voice on the court, said the state was wrong to cut off access to \u201cperhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen today to make his or her voice heard.\u201d)\n\nThose around Harris say that Harris knew she was walking a fine line on cyber-exploitation, but thought it one worth walking. As Citron, the Maryland law professor puts it, Harris wanted to answer the question: \u201cHow do you address this problem without letting anti-porn lunatics take over?\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nOn October 7, 2016, an airplane arrived from Amsterdam at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. Onboard was an executive named Carl Ferrer, the CEO of Backpage.com, an online martketplace for everything from used cars to odd jobs to strippers, a business said to be worth more than a half-billion dollars. Waiting for Ferrer when he landed was a team of local law enforcement agents, who arrested him on a warrant issued by Harris in California.\n\nOne of Harris' biggest internet victories was the takedown of the online classified site Backpage.com. Second from left, Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer is pictured; second from right, UGotPosted creator Kevin Bollaert, another Harris target, is pictured. | AP, Wikimedia Commons\n\nBackpage was by far the biggest internet fish Kamala Harris had gone after. The arrest warrant alleged that Ferrer oversaw the posting of paid ads for prostitutes, including minors. Working with Texas authorities, she also had Backpage\u2019s Dallas offices raided. The case would turn out to be something of an embarrassment in legal terms. But it was a huge political win for Harris, and it embodied exactly the mix of political ambition and legal risk-taking that makes people in the tech world nervous about her.\n\nBy that time, Harris had already notched one major win in her campaign against internet harassment. In 2013, she had arrested a 27-year-old San Diego resident named Kevin Bollaert who ran a website called UGotPosted. Its business model was as vicious as it was simple: It solicited nude photos along with the personal details \u2014 name, address, Facebook profile \u2014 of the people in them. The photos had often been stolen, or taken in secret and posted without consent. Once Bollaert posted the photos and details, often triggering a barrage of phone and online harassment of the women in the pictures, Bollaert would then charge victims to have them removed.\n\nBollaert\u2019s defense was that his site was a neutral platform, and he had no legal liability for what people posted there. It was a defense based on Section 230, a piece of federal law that had survived, orphanlike, from when the courts scuttled most of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Section 230 limited the liability of so-called online intermediaries, declaring that \u201cno provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d In the 20-plus years since, this one passage of the law had become a linchpin of internet freedom, and a rallying point for the techno-libertarians whose thinking dominated Silicon Valley. At the highest level, it protected Facebook, Twitter and others from being held responsible for illegal content their users posted. At the lowest, it protected operators like Bollaert the same way. Bollaert argued that his nude-photo platform and his take-down service, a sister company called ChangeMyReputation.com, which purported to be a straightforward online reputation-management service, were protected because his was an open platform.\n\nInternet Law and Sex A brief history. The Telecommunications Act of 1996\n\nOn Feb. 8, 1996, Bill Clinton signed into law the first major overhaul of telecommunications regulation in over six decades. Title V of the legislation, commonly known as the Communications Decency Act, would impose criminal sanctions on anyone who used the Internet to transmit \u201cobscene or indecent\u201d material to persons under 18. Section 230\n\nJust a year later, in the landmark 1997 case Reno v. ACLU, the Supreme Court struck down most of the CDA on First Amendment grounds. However, one part was saved: Section 230 said Internet service providers weren\u2019t liable for content posted by third parties. That became a central protection for the massive online platforms which would grow in the next decade. FOSTA-SESTA\n\nIn 2018, triggered in part by the furor over Backpage.com\u2019s sex ads, Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed a bill \u2014 the joint Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) and Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) \u2014 loosening Section 230\u2019s protections when it came to federal and state sex-trafficking laws.\n\n\u201cIs it illegal to host a website where bad things happen?,\u201d asked Bollaert\u2019s attorney in her closing argument. \u201cIs it illegal to hold up a big blank canvas to anyone who wants to paint it?\u201d\n\nIn one sense, Harris\u2019 case simply ignored the \u201cinternet\u201d part of Bollaert\u2019s internet operation and treated his behavior as real-world crimes; her office charged him with both extortion and identity theft. But many also saw it as a direct attempt to weaken a law that was protecting a huge and important industry. Harris and her team argued that it was clear that Bollaert\u2019s site wasn\u2019t like Facebook or Twitter, open platforms where users decide what to post. Bollaert, instead, was a publisher. One legal analyst who worked on the case attempted to upload to UGotPosted a photo of her cat, named Shiloh. The cat photo was rejected, which the prosecutors said was proof Bollaert was actively managing the site with the goal of exploiting real people.\n\nA jury agreed, and Bollaert was found guilty and sentenced to 18 years in prison. In a press statement on the day of his conviction, Harris declared it a landmark in holding bad actors accountable, even online. \u201cSitting behind a computer, committing what is essentially a cowardly and criminal act, will not shield predators from the law or jail,\u201d she said. Bollaert appealed, but the court found that by requiring identifying details on victims before they were posted, Bollaert was actively engaged in posting the offending content, and was thus not protected by Section 230. Harris had scored the country\u2019s first major revenge porn conviction \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t lost on advocates that she had done it by whittling down the definition of a protected site.\n\nThe Backpage case she prosecuted in 2016 was much bigger, and Harris tried to take it one step further. An online classified site, Backpage had been launched in 2004 by the owners of the country\u2019s largest chain of alternative newsweeklies as a way to tap into the digital ad revolution triggered by Craigslist. It became known for its \u201cadult\u201d section, which critics said was a hub for illegal prostitution \u2014 some of it nonconsensual \u2014 and human trafficking, including that of minors. Law enforcement officials had been watching Backpage from the start, and had been trying, with little success, to get Backpage taken down. Backpage wasn\u2019t simply an online classified site, they believed: It functioned as an online brothel, with the full knowledge of its operators.\n\nBackpage, however, had largely operated with the protection of Section 230. Its owners argued that they were running a legitimate classified ad platform and weren't liable for how people chose to use that ad space.\n\nHarris decided to come at them head-on. After a three-year investigation by her office, Harris had Ferrer arrested on charges of pimping and pandering. Harris herself was given play-by-play updates during the dramatic arrest and raid in Texas, according to her staff. Ferrer was extradited to California and jailed. The prosecutors\u2019 request for a warrant argued that it was \u201cobvious\u201d that ads on the Backpage site were for illegal prostitution and trafficking, and that Ferrer and other company stakeholders, who were also charged, were knowingly profiting from those postings. \u201cThe Communications Decency Act was not meant to a shield from criminal prosecution for perpetrators of online brothels,\u201d said Harris. Her de facto chief of staff at the time, Venus Johnson, put it more bluntly in a recent interview: \u201cIt was a long time coming,\u201d she said.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t how Backpage\u2019s lawyers saw it. \u201cFrankly outrageous,\u201d one of Backpage\u2019s attorneys called Harris\u2019 theory of the prosecution. He pointed to a 2013 letter to Congress by 49 attorneys general of U.S. states and territories \u2014 including Harris \u2014 which argued that Section 230 needed to be amended to allow state officials to prosecute sex trafficking crimes. In other words, she knew full well that Section 230 didn\u2019t allow her to press this case. This wasn\u2019t the Bollaert case, Ferrer\u2019s lawyers argued. Ferrer had taken a hands-off approach to the site, and thus was inarguably legally protected.\n\nThere was one other important fact about the arrest: It occurred just weeks before the November 2016 election, in which Harris was running for U.S. Senate.\n\nThe dramatic arrest was widely covered not only in California newspapers, but by USA Today, NPR, CNN, the New York Times, and scores of other publications. Harris featured prominently in the coverage. Backpage\u2019s general counsel, in a press statement, called Ferrer\u2019s arrest and the office raid \u201can election-year stunt, not a good faith action by law enforcement.\u201d In a statement released to the public as they asked a judge to drop the charges, Backpage shareholders Michael Lacey and James Larkin, who were charged alongside Ferrer, added a few digs of their own: \u201cMake no mistake; Kamala Harris has won all that she was looking to win when she had us arrested,\u201d they said. \u201cLike Sheriff [Joe] Arpaio, she issued her sanctimonious public statement, controlled her media cycle and got her \u2018perp walk\u2019 on the evening news.\u201d\n\nOn the legal front, at least, the court agreed with Backpage. On December 9, 2016, a Superior Court judge threw out Harris\u2019 case on Section 230 grounds. \u201cAny rational mind would concur that the selling of minors for the purpose of sex is particularly horrifying,\u201d wrote Superior Court Judge Michael Bowman. But, said the judge, the government\u2019s hands were tied by free speech and the law of the internet: \u201cCongress has spoken on this matter and it is for Congress, not this Court to revisit.\u201d Harris, in a statement, called herself \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Bowman\u2019s ruling.\n\nLeBlanc, Harris\u2019 one-time senior adviser, who by then had moved to a job back in Washington running a bureau of the Federal Communications Commission, called it \u201can innovative lawsuit.\u201d Added LeBlanc, \u201cwhen you do something that hasn\u2019t been done before, there\u2019s some risk that you take.\u201d\n\nBy that time, however, there wasn\u2019t much risk for Harris herself: She had easily won the Senate seat in a 25-point victory over rival Loretta Sanchez. Harris refiled an amended set of charges and left for Washington. The California Department of Justice stayed focused on Backpage, and the next California attorney general, former congressman Xavier Becerra, would keep up the pursuit, focusing on the more technical complaint that Backpage\u2019s operators had committed bank fraud by disguising the true origins of their revenue from payment processors skittish about working with the site. In April 2018, Ferrer pled guilty to state and federal counts of money laundering and conspiracy. Federal authorities, pursuing their own charges, seized the site and Backpage shut its doors.\n\nAt some level, Harris\u2019 prosecution worked. Her aggressive approach had opened the door to the case that eventually took down the site. And to her supporters who saw her crusade as long overdue, it was a win \u2014 however tortured the road. To the tech world, however, it was clear that Harris was willing to steamroll the legal protections the industry considered, and still considers, central to its business model. \u201cHer position was perfectly clear,\u201d says Eric Goldman, professor at Santa Clara University\u2019s law school, and head of its institute of technology. \u201cShe was doing everything in her power to undermine Backpage, and she was willing to sacrifice Section 230 to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhen Harris took her seat in the Senate, she became arguably one of the most tech-savvy members of a body sorely lacking in digital know-how. But she hasn\u2019t made technology her key issue in Washington, and if anything has shied away from the topic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something of a populist position,\" Harris critic Mike Masnick says about her legal push, \"but I fear where that populist position ends up undermining the Internet as we know and love it.\u201d | Getty Images\n\nIn the fall of 2017, she and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, introduced a bill that would criminalize the knowing distribution of revenge porn, but it never attracted a single Senate co-sponsor beyond the original three. She did pose questions to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in his April 2018 Senate hearing, and COO Sheryl Sandberg that September, but otherwise hasn\u2019t been a high-profile player in the debates over Facebook\u2019s privacy violations.\n\nHer most notable absence came on the issue closest to her own record. In the spring of 2018, Congress debated and passed a bill that would change how Section 230 applies to sex-trafficking cases, freeing state and federal officials alike to bring prosecutions. The federal measure was targeted at Backpage, but would also apply more widely to online operators. Silicon Valley dug in against it, with Google calling it a \u201cdisaster\u201d: making online platforms more liable for sex-trafficking content would lower their incentive to police for it, the company argued. In September 2017, New York Times writer Nicholas Kristof published an industry-shaming column called \u201cGoogle and Sex Traffickers Like Backpage.com.\u201d After winning some wording changes and once its passage looked inevitable, mainstream tech companies later dropped their opposition to the bill.\n\nThe issue would normally be squarely in Harris\u2019 wheelhouse, but she played no public role in either drafting or advancing the bill. In fact, she was not among its original 25 backers in the Senate, and initially balked at signing the bill at all, though she eventually added her name to the measure three months after it was introduced. Those close to her say she and her staff worried that the bill was so vaguely written that companies, unsure how to comply with it, would simply stop attempting to clean up their platforms.\n\nDid Harris\u2019 White House ambitions lead her to back off? If history is any guide, political figures can get eviscerated when they\u2019re seen as cracking down on free speech: In the 1980s, Tipper Gore was vilified by critics for pushing for parental advisory labels. And in the mid-2000s Hillary Clinton was hotly criticized for attempting to impose restrictions on violent video games. Said Clinton at the time, \u201cWe need to treat violent video games the way we treat tobacco, alcohol, and pornography.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 aggressive record on online exploitation could pose a problem with two core Democratic constituencies: civil libertarians, who serve as an ideological validator inside the party, and the tech industry, which has served as a cultural one \u2014 not to mention the major fundraising power of Silicon Valley.\n\nEvan Engstrom is the executive director of Engine, a California-based policy advocacy group representing small tech companies. He worked closely with Harris\u2019 Senate office on the sex-trafficking bill, which his group opposed. \u201cObviously there was a lot of skepticism going in because of the positions she took as AG,\u201d says Engstrom. \u201cHer reputation wasn\u2019t all that great. But I can say with enthusiasm that they were responsive, engaged and thoughtful.\u201d\n\nStill, Harris hasn\u2019t appeased all critics. Says Techdirt\u2019s Mike Masnick, \u201cin a lot of circles, she\u2019s certainly looked upon as being friendly to tech, of having a close relationship with tech, and I wish that were more true.\u201d\n\nGoldman, the Santa Clara professor, says that we\u2019re already beginning to see the negative repercussions of a chipping away of free speech online in a way that diminishes the online world. Craigslist has taken down its own adult section. Tumblr now bans \u201cadult content,\u201d including depictions of genitalia and sex acts. And Patreon, a platform for artists and other creators to connect with supporters, has banned from its platform fundraising for the production of legal pornographic material. Says Goldman, \u201cOne way to think about it is the Internet has shrunk a bit. The boundaries have moved in.\u201d\n\nAs a candidate for president, Harris would benefit greatly for having tech show up big for her, not just merely see her as acceptable. Harris could likely use the U.S. tech industry\u2019s financial largess. She\u2019s been a government lawyer all her life \u2014 the only client she\u2019s ever had, she has said, has been the people of California; her top salary as attorney general was $157,000, less than some of her staff earned. Silicon Valley has become a major stop on Democrats\u2019 fundraising circuit, the way Hollywood once was. During her 2016 run, she took in a bit of tech money \u2014 some $214,000 from the internet industry, per the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign fundraising. But she raised far more from the television, movie and music industries that have long been critical of the internet, to the tune of nearly a million dollars.\n\nLeBlanc, the former California special assistant attorney general, now a lawyer in private practice in Washington, D.C., says that Harris isn\u2019t blind to possible tensions with the tech industry, and their effect on what\u2019s next for her in politics. She\u2019s just not distracted by them. \u201cEvery elected official in any state is concerned about where their major industries are on issues,\u201d says LeBlanc, \u201cbut I think she follows her own moral compass.\u201d\n\nWhat remains today for Harris is a reputation on tech that is largely in the eye of the beholder. Harris is, at once, a tech-savvy law enforcement official who looked the internet\u2019s dark side squarely in the eye, a single-minded tough-on-crime type who cared little about her effect on digital world, a circumspect state official who ultimately did not go hard enough on her home state\u2019s biggest tech corporations, a creative regulator who came up with nuanced solutions to high-tech problems, or\u2014depending on the case, legal question or even day\u2014some blend of all those.\n\n\u201cShe was in the heart of Silicon Valley and she didn\u2019t take no nonsense,\u201d says Danielle Citron, the law professor. \u201cI think her preference is, \u2018It\u2019s good for business, but let\u2019s figure out how it\u2019s good for society.\u2019 I don\u2019t think she\u2019s cowed by anybody.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story", "text": "The Friday Cover\n\nPeople predict the president will collapse under the stress of the Mueller investigation.

Pence pointedly reiterated the dictates in a second speech, even after being issued a flat denial the first time around.\n\nOn the foreign stage, White House officials say Pence has sometimes settled into a role as the administration\u2019s bad cop, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as the diplomat who sticks around to hash out particulars and the president as the showman who swoops in from time to time. And it\u2019s a role Pence will likely continue to play in the next few months, as Trump\u2019s schedule becomes increasingly campaign-focused.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest example of the unique way the Trump administration conducts business \u2014 past vice presidents have been sent to overseas locales farther down the geopolitical priority list. But with Trump preferring domestic travel \u2014 and the ever-present potential for gaffes and protests when he does venture overseas \u2014 Pence has increasingly become the face of Trumpism abroad. To his supporters, Pence is seen as an powerful defender of the president\u2019s agenda \u2014 someone who has not once veered from his script in a way that undermined Trump. But critics say Pence has done little more than exacerbate already tense relationships between the U.S. and allies by simply repeating Trump\u2019s threats and grievances in a different tone.\n\n\u201cThe vice president consults with the president before and during all of these major trips and he\u2019s always delivering the message that the president wants him to deliver,\u201d said former Pence Press Secretary Marc Lotter, who recently joined Trump\u2019s 2020 operation.\n\nNow, Pence is turning his focus to Venezuela, an issue where he has been at the front and center from the beginning for the Trump administration. Pence was the first senior Trump administration official to phone Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 the day before he declared himself interim president of the economically strapped country. In the weeks since, many Latin American countries and America\u2019s EU allies have followed the U.S. government in recognizing Guaid\u00f3 as the true Venezuelan leader.\n\nAnd in his speech Monday, Pence plans to reaffirm \u201cthe United States\u2019 unwavering support\u201d for Guaid\u00f3 just 48 hours after the opposition leader and more than 600,000 volunteers will attempt to bring humanitarian aid packages into the country that Maduro has been blocking at the border. Backed by a coalition of Latin American governments, Pence will declare that \u201cthe time has come for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to step aside,\u201d the White House said Thursday.\n\nIt will be Pence\u2019s fifth trip to Latin America since taking office.\n\n\u201cHe wants to keep the drumbeat going,\u201d a senior White House official told POLITICO, adding that both Pence and President Donald Trump believe the situation in Venezuela \u201ccould become the most significant foreign policy event of this administration.\u201d\n\nVenezuela is just one of myriad foreign policy issues Pence has folded into his portfolio.\n\nPence was the most senior official sent to a gathering on Middle East policy in Warsaw last week.\n\nAt the event, he diverged from his prepared remarks to call on the United States\u2019 European partners \u201cto withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\u201d Trump announced last year that the U.S. would exit the agreement \u2014 in which Tehran pledged to curb its nuclear program in exchange for economic sanctions relief \u2014 calling it a disaster for America.\n\nIn Warsaw, Pence accused European allies of undermining U.S. sanctions that were reimposed against Iran after Trump abandoned the accord, though he declined to name-check Germany, France or Britain for launching a mechanism last month that\u2019s designed to allow for continued trade with Iran. He reiterated the same talking points during a speech days later at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top leaders from around the world.\n\n\u201cIt is an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the [European Union] and create still more distance between Europe and the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was a moment that surprised foreign diplomats, who felt that Pence\u2019s remarks might actually embolden Iran, giving its officials easy attack lines. Indeed, Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif referenced Pence\u2019s Warsaw comments during his own speech in Munich.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel also picked up on the remarks, accusing the Trump administration of strengthening adversaries like Iran and Russia with its demands. Germany, France and the European Union had all declined to send their top diplomats to the Warsaw gathering.\n\nThe senior White House official said Pence\u2019s fiery comments were meant to signal the administration\u2019s move \u201ctoward a tougher stance against Iran, which includes pushing allies to withdraw\u201d from the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThe vice president used bilateral meetings in Munich and Warsaw to highlight not just the security threat posed by Iran,\u201d said the official, but to also challenge European allies on their business with a regime that has been known to \u201cstifle free speech, kill gay people and persecute political dissenters.\u201d\n\nPence has also occasionally popped up as a key player in the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing denuclearization negotiations with North Korea. It was his comparison of North Korea to Libya that drew fierce backlash from Pyongyang last May, temporarily jeopardizing a planned summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un \u2014 the showman aspect the president relishes. Trump will meet again with Kim next week in Vietnam for their second optics-heavy international summit.\n\nPart of the reason Pence enjoys such autonomy on the foreign stage is due, in part, to his proficiency at weaving profuse Trump flattery into his appearances, according to a former White House official.\n\nIn Munich, for instance, Pence spoke Trump\u2019s name 30 times, claiming at one point that \u201cunder President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership, America is leading the free world once again.\u201d In Warsaw, a transcript of Pence\u2019s speech shows 16 mentions of Trump by name, with four additional references to \u201cthe president.\u201d By comparison, then-Vice President Joe Biden mentioned President Barack Obama only once by name in his 2015 speech to the Munich Security Conference.\n\nBehind the scenes, Pence has even worked with president on developing and messaging the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy agenda.\n\nFollowing months and months of meetings with Christian leaders and national security experts, Pence successfully pressured administration officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development to funnel millions of dollars to Christian and Yazidi religious communities in Iraq that the Islamic State has decimated. The United Nations would have otherwise distributed the funds.\n\n\u201cI called it to [Trump\u2019s] attention that we could bypass U.N. programs and fund religious-based NGOs directly,\u201d Pence told the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview, adding that Trump agreed \u201con the spot.\u201d\n\nPence is expected to remain mostly in the foreign policy lane as the 2020 campaign draws more of Trump\u2019s attention and the administration works to broker a trade agreement with China and win Congress\u2019 approval of its renegotiated trade deal with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe vice president will help sell the U.S.-Canada-Mexico deal \u2014 which would update the NAFTA trade agreement \u2014 with a Midwest swing in the coming weeks, according to two people familiar with his plans. The tour is expected to bring Pence to a host of farm towns and domestic manufacturing plants, where he will meet with small crowds and deliver remarks in an attempt to pressure Capitol Hill into swiftly passing the accord.\n\nRead this next: EU body updates rules on harassment"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/orban-faces-backlash-after-attack-on-juncker/", "text": "A Hungarian government-sponsored attack campaign on European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker backfired as senior officials in the European People's Party (EPP) rebuked Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nSome officials called for an apology while others said that Orb\u00e1n and his party, Fidesz, should be kicked out of the EPP, the mainstream center-right group that has controlled EU politics for decades.\n\nAnd Juncker, speaking at an event in Brussels, declared, \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nThis week, the Hungarian government unveiled a taxpayer-financed campaign attacking Juncker, along with the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, and accusing officials in Brussels of plotting to impose migration policies that go against Hungary's interests. In reality, the EU has been paralyzed from adopting any new policies on migration largely because of Orb\u00e1n's refusal to agree to any compromise that would take pressure off frontline countries such as Italy.\n\nThe chorus of voices speaking out in defense of Juncker suggests that Orb\u00e1n will face a renewed push to oust him from the EPP.\n\nSo far, party chieftains, including the EPP president, Joseph Daul, have protected Orb\u00e1n, mindful that the 12 seats Fidesz holds in the European Parliament are important for the EPP's majority and its future election prospects. The EPP also fears Fidesz joining forces with Euroskeptics if it is kicked out of its current home.\n\n\"Parts of the speech on the State of the Nation and the poster campaign against Jean-Claude Juncker cause great incomprehension and anger in the EPP,\" Manfred Weber, the party's candidate for Commission president and leader of the group in the European Parliament, told the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung on Thursday.\n\n\"I find some of the wording unacceptable. One cannot belong to the EPP and campaign against the current EPP Commission president,\" Weber said. \"That is not acceptable. I expect the CDU [the German Christian Democrats] and CSU [Christian Social Union] to look into this as well. Viktor Orb\u00e1n must realize that he is currently moving ever further away from the EPP.\"\n\nWeber has been an ally of Orb\u00e1n in the past, though in the fall Weber voted in favor of a Parliament resolution to open disciplinary proceedings against Hungary for allegedly breaching core EU values. In initiating the so-called Article 7 proceedings, the Parliament cited concerns about judicial independence, corruption, freedom of expression, academic freedom, the rights of minorities and migrants, and other issues.\n\nOrb\u00e1n, however, has remained defiant in the face of criticism from Brussels, insisting that he is a defender of \"illiberal democracy\" and \"Christian Europe,\" and that Hungary will not tolerate being dictated to by Western Europe.\"\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that Orb\u00e1n is really trying hard to provoke EPP ...\" \u2014 An EPP politician\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister's continued combative rhetoric has presented a growing problem for Weber and the EPP ahead of the European Parliament election. Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans, who is the center-left Party of European Socialists' candidate for Commission president, has used Orb\u00e1n to warn that a vote for the EPP and Weber could lead to a governing coalition in the European Parliament that includes far-right forces.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is the most prominent national EPP leader, weighed in on Thursday in defense of the Commission president. \"Jean-Claude Juncker has my full solidarity,\" she said.\n\nEPP insiders on Thursday said they anticipate a more forceful statement \u2014 potentially including a demand for the ouster of Fidesz \u2014 by Merkel and Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who succeeded Merkel as leader of the CDU, the governing EPP party in Germany.\n\nSeveral EPP officials said the group has not yet made any decision to expel Fidesz, but said the issue would be discussed at an EPP group meeting next week. Still, an official from the EPP group said: \u201cWe have now placed the missile on the launchpad.\u201d\n\nThe question of expelling Fidesz has largely been in the hands of Daul, the EPP president who is close to Orb\u00e1n and previously has sought to rein in the combustible Hungarian. Though many in the EPP share some of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s positions on migration, they have also been shocked by his disloyalty to the political family and his attacks on Juncker, among the party's most public figures.\n\n\"... In Europe there is no progress if nations are fighting against each another. There is no progress if there is hatred in the world. We had this in Europe. Enough is enough.\" \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker\n\nDaul has long said there was never sufficient backing among EPP member parties to expel Fidesz. According to EPP rules, the suspension or exclusion of a member can be made with a vote by \u201cseven ordinary or associated member parties from five different countries.\u201d\n\nIn Brussels on Thursday, Gabriele Bischoff, the president of the Workers' Group in the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), publicly voiced support for Juncker who participated in a panel discussion at the committee's plenary session.\n\n\"I just wanted to assure you we are all appalled about these kinds of messages of spreading hate and that we all together stand here in solidarity and support and we will do the utmost to make sure that this is not possible anymore in any country in Europe,\" Bischoff said.\n\nIn 2015, Juncker famously greeted Orb\u00e1n by declaring \"Hello, dictator\" and slapping him on the cheek. But on Tuesday Juncker called for Orb\u00e1n to be kicked out of the EPP and on Thursday, in response to Bischoff's support, referred to Orb\u00e1n as his \"friend\" but said there is no place for hate.\n\n\"I will convey the message to my good friend Viktor Orb\u00e1n,\" Juncker said, drawing laughs from the audience. \"Yeah,\" Juncker pushed back on the giggles, \"he is a good friend.\"\n\nThe moderator of the panel, Shada Islam of Friends of Europe, interjected sarcastically, \"You keep good company, sir.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Juncker replied, \"but I am totally unable to hate someone and I am very much surprised if I am seeing these posters now spread around in Hungary full of hatred. But I am not giving in. I am not like that. I want to be exactly the opposite of that. In Europe there is no progress if nations are fighting against each another. There is no progress if there is hatred in the world. We had this in Europe. Enough is enough.\"\n\nOrb\u00e1n and his allies, however, show no sign of retreat.\n\nThe Commission and EPP \u201cshould be capable of self-criticism,\" Orb\u00e1n's chief of staff, Gergely Guly\u00e1s, told reporters, pointing to Brexit and the migration crisis as failures of the Juncker Commission.\n\n\"The recent actions of Mr. Orb\u00e1n and his government are crossing new red lines, beyond the ones already crossed\" \u2014 Swedish MEP Gunnar H\u00f6kmark\n\n\u201cWe have always been loyal to the European People\u2019s Party,\u201d he said, emphasizing that Orb\u00e1n did not initially support Juncker\u2019s appointment as Commission president and that Juncker has tried to get Fidesz kicked out of the EPP.\n\nThe Hungarian government intends to continue its broadside against Juncker, Soros and Brussels. While there are already anti-Juncker posters and videos, Guly\u00e1s announced that the government will send a letter to each Hungarian citizen explaining its campaign.\n\nOne EPP politician said it appears Orb\u00e1n is trying to bait the EPP into expelling his party.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that Orb\u00e1n is really trying hard to provoke EPP to actually get rid of them,\u201d the politician said. \u201cOrb\u00e1n just doesn\u2019t want to call it quits himself because he needs the \u2018final chapter\u2019 to be played publicly so that he can tell his disciples around Europe that \u2018see, EPP is actually a force that wants to destroy Europe \u2014 they wanted to get rid of us, the saviors of Christian Europe.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome rank-and-file EPP members in the European Parliament expressed outrage at Orb\u00e1n and deep exasperation.\n\n\"The recent actions of Mr. Orb\u00e1n and his government are crossing new red lines, beyond the ones already crossed,\" Swedish MEP Gunnar H\u00f6kmark wrote in a letter to Weber. \"With an anti-Semitic tone, he is attacking Brussels, the president of the European Commission, our EPP colleague Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU as a whole by portraying them as enemies of the Hungarian people. He neglects that all decisions taken by the EU are part of a process where Hungarian MEPs and the Hungarian government are included. It is populism of the worst kind.\"\n\n\"I propose that we, as a matter of urgency, address the question of Mr. Orb\u00e1n and Fidesz at the next group meeting and at an extra meeting with the Bureau of the group already next week,\" H\u00f6kmark added.\n\nRead this next: UK food supply under threat from no-deal Brexit"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-body-updates-rules-on-harassment/", "text": "European Union flag | Photo by Carl Court via Getty Images EU body updates rules on harassment Complaints have been made of bullying by a senior member of the European Economic and Social Committee.\n\nAn EU body that brings together employers and workers adopted changes to its rules on Wednesday to allow it to sanction members found guilty of harassing their colleagues.\n\nMembers of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) found guilty of harassment can now receive sanctions ranging from a written warning to suspension from authoring reports, chairing study group meetings, and participating in missions, depending on the severity of the member's behavior.

It depends on whom you speak to.\n\nTo some, Begum \u2014 the East London schoolgirl who joined the Islamic State group in Syria and now wishes to return home \u2014 is a groomed child, indoctrinated by predatory men, a young mother in urgent need. To others, she is a terrorist cheerleader, an unrepentant participant in the destruction of a nation, who deserves everything she gets.\n\nFor all the debate over what she is, the U.K. Home Office has decided what she is not: As of this week, Shamima Begum is no longer a British citizen.\n\nHer story has caught the public\u2019s attention. But she is also just one of a growing number of Britons to have had their U.K. nationality revoked over the past few years by an obscure executive power that allows the government to remove citizenship without judicial oversight.\n\nWhen I started investigating this so-called royal prerogative power in 2013, its use was sparing. Successive immigration acts, signed in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks and the 7/7 London bombings, allowed ministers to revoke an individual\u2019s citizenship if they were deemed \u201cseriously prejudicial to the public good.\u201d\n\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid admitted that around 150 Britons have had their citizenship removed since 2010.\n\nAlthough the power was criticized by human rights groups, it could only be used on dual-national Britons \u2014 that is, the U.K. couldn\u2019t revoke someone\u2019s citizenship if it left them stateless.\n\nThat changed in 2014, when the coalition put forward the Immigration Act, which critics argued created two tiers of British citizen: those somehow inalienably more British because they were born in the country and counted only Britons among their immediate ancestry, and those who could be targeted by the law because they were either naturalized or came from non-British lineage.\n\nBegum, with her Bangladeshi heritage, falls into the latter camp. And she is far from alone, as became obvious when Home Secretary Sajid Javid admitted that around 150 Britons have had their citizenship removed since 2010.\n\nThe government argues that because Begum could apply for Bangladeshi citizenship in future, she isn\u2019t technically stateless. This is hard to take seriously. It would be analogous for the government to demolish your house, then deny it had made you homeless because you could theoretically build another. As one leading legal expert put it in 2014 when the law passed: \u201cStatelessness is not about options or eligibility, but about the facts here and now.\u201d\n\nStatelessness has been likened to \u201cmedieval exile\u201d and a tactic \u201cbeloved of the world\u2019s worst regimes.\u201d The British government is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which entitles each human to citizenship and the freedoms and protections it bestows. Yet the government repeatedly wheels out the falsehood that \u201ccitizenship is a privilege not a right.\u201d Citizenship is neither a privilege nor a right; it is rather \"a state under which an individual is afforded rights.\"\n\nAs a citizen, even one accused of serious crimes, it is your right to receive a fair trial, access legal counsel, know the charges against you, and avoid cruel and unusual punishment. As a \u201ccitizen of nowhere,\u201d to borrow a phrase from Theresa May, you have no rights at all.\n\nIt bears repeating that at the time an individual is stripped of their nationality they are to the letter of the law innocent. Prerogative power is executive, and while the accused have a de facto right to appeal to the judiciary, such recourse is rarely used (since the suspect is normally outside the U.K. when the order is given) and even more rarely used successfully (since the evidence against them is kept secret).\n\nIt could be that these people are guilty of serious crimes. That is, after all, the Home Office\u2019s argument, though we must trust them on the evidence. The government can use the \u201croyal prerogative\u201d when ministers suspect a citizen of terror-related offences, or believe they acquired their nationality fraudulently, but it requires no trial or conviction in order to take effect.\n\nBut aside from the human rights aspect \u2014 individuals involved have little or no habeas corpus protections \u2014 citizenship-stripping raises more security concerns than it purports to solve.\n\nIf the government believes its citizens to be dangerous terrorists, does it not have an obligation to prosecute and, if guilty, punish them? Its current approach is tantamount to cutting them loose abroad and leaving other countries to deal with the grave risks they allegedly pose.\n\nCitizenship-stripping and statelessness run contrary to nearly every international legal, human rights, and security and moral norms. Yet several countries have in recent years followed Britain\u2019s lead to adopt such powers.\n\nThe process cuts to the heart of what it means to be a citizen, of Britain or anywhere. Do we believe that under the law all citizens should be treated equally, regardless of race or background? I believe most people \u2014 certainly most politicians \u2014 would say yes.\n\nThe rights and responsibilities of citizenship cut both ways. Does a country like Britain really bear no culpability for a young woman who was born, raised and ultimately indoctrinated within its borders? As Begum\u2019s case so starkly highlights, the government believes the answer to this to be: It depends on your background.\n\nA schoolgirl with solely British heritage who traveled to Syria to join a group responsible for terrible atrocities would, under the government\u2019s own legal justification, still be British today. Shamima Begum isn\u2019t. Irrespective of how we view the young woman, that\u2019s a dual-standard that should concern us all.\n\nPatrick Galey is a journalist and writer who investigated the U.K.'s citizenship-stripping program between 2013 and 2014.

How this once-maligned practice can support investor and corporate needs while playing a positive role in the financing of a changing economy.\n\nThe term shadow banking was coined in 2007 to describe parts of the financial intermediation process conducted outside of the commercial banking system.That is, the process of taking in funds from a depositor and then lending them out to a borrower. The term has somewhat pejorative connotations derived from the role played by shadow banking in the financial crisis (2008), including the proliferation of complex and opaque financing vehicles, poor loan origination practices and high system-wide leverage. However, there is growing recognition among policymakers as well as investors that a more transparent and safer shadow banking system can support the efficient functioning of capital markets and play a positive role in the financing of the economy. Indeed, alternative financing channels are likely to grow in importance in the years ahead if traditional bank lending remains constrained.\n\nShadow banking can be distilled into two elements, wholesale markets-based credit intermediation and alternative lending channels. The former includes certain types of investment funds and securitization vehicles, as well as activities such as securities financing transactions. Alternative lending channels include marketplace lending and other forms of nonbank direct loan provision. In each case, the shadow bank (or nonbank) credit intermediation process is considered to be \u201cbank-like\u201d because it typically involves short-term funding or borrowing to facilitate longer-term lending or investment in less liquid assets, resulting in maturity transformation, liquidity transformation, credit risk transfer, or leverage.\n\nShadow banking is also interconnected with the banking system. However, shadow banks differ from traditional commercial banks in four key aspects: (i) they are not subject to prudential regulation such as capital adequacy rules; (ii) their deposits/liabilities are not insured/guaranteed by government; (iii) shadow banks do not \u201ccreate\u201d money; (iv) shadow banks do not have recourse to central bank liquidity, largely because of the other three factors. It is important to take account of these differences when determining the appropriate scope and calibration of shadow banking regulation.\n\nAlternative financing channels are likely to grow in importance in the years ahead if traditional bank lending remains constrained.\n\nMarkets-based finance\n\nWholesale markets-based credit intermediation includes money market funds, leveraged hedge funds, broker/dealers and securities lending agents, and securitization vehicles. It also includes activities such as securities financing transactions (for example, repurchase agreements and securities lending) and the reuse of collateral associated with these transactions.\n\nThis part of the shadow banking system is mostly well regulated. In the European Union, for example, regulation of alternative investment funds addresses liquidity risk, leverage, transparency and investor protection considerations.\n\nThe focus of shadow banking policy initiatives has shifted toward securitization. In Europe, reform of securitization markets has gained new impetus under the guise of the capital markets union (CMU) initiative and its focus on the creation of simple, transparent, and standardized securitization.\n\nGreater investor participation in securitization markets, coupled with supply-side measures such as reduced regulatory capital charges for high-quality or \u201cqualifying\u201d securitized assets, would also help banks to free up their balance sheets for more traditional lending, providing a boost to credit availability.\n\nOverall, wholesale markets-based credit intermediation makes up the vast majority of the shadow banking system, particularly in economies with advanced financial markets, such as the European Union.\n\nWholesale markets-based credit intermediation makes up the vast majority of the shadow banking system, particularly in economies with advanced financial markets, such as the European Union.\n\nAlternative lending\n\nAlternative lending channels include a variety of nonbank loan companies, such as microfinance companies specializing in credit provision to small businesses, mortgage servicing firms, entities providing entrusted loans and letters of credit, peer-to-peer (P2P) loans and online lending platforms. Additionally, alternative asset managers are engaging in direct loan provision to borrowers traditionally serviced by banks.\n\nTechnology has been a key enabler of the growth in alternative lending channels, underpinned by big data analysis capabilities. Blockchain technologies are expected to further accelerate the growth in these channels. The 2016 CFA Institute Fintech Survey Report shows that \u201cwhile robo-advisers are already having a market impact in investment management, blockchain technologies are increasingly entering the public consciousness,\u201d and are considered to be a potential future opportunity in the medium- to long-term.\n\nIndeed, the asset management industry is playing an increasingly important role in direct lending. Against the backdrop of a low interest rate environment, demand for higher-yielding investments from pension funds, insurance companies, endowments and other institutional investors has encouraged alternative asset managers such as hedge funds, private equity funds and business development companies to enter the leveraged lending and direct loan markets.\n\nShadow banking can play a positive role in supporting economic growth.\n\nCrowdfunding is another example of use of technology that enhances access to the capital markets facilitating the granting of loans. Crowdfunding supports small companies and startups, which can raise finance without having to repay their investors.\n\nAlthough alternative lending channels remain relatively small compared with both traditional bank lending and mainstream markets finance, they have high growth potential. As this part of the shadow banking sector increases in prominence, adequate levels of transparency and investor protection will become essential to maintain investor confidence and market integrity. In the long-term, the sustainability of these credit channels will depend on the extent to which they can compete on fair terms with bank finance.\n\nShadow banking can play a positive role in supporting economic growth by diversifying sources of finance, deepening and broadening the available pool of capital for companies, and lowering funding costs for corporates and banks. Policy measures to support transparent and simple markets-based finance are desirable to attract investor interest and support the supply of funds, while adequate levels of transparency and investor protection in alternative lending vehicles are necessary to ensure market integrity. Within this sphere, marketplace lending and direct lending from within the asset-management sector may to continue to grow and play an increasingly important role in the provision of credit to the real economy.\n\nProper monitoring of credit flows and systemic risks is fundamental to prevent defaults that would endanger financial stability.\n\nIf well structured and supported by appropriate policy measures, the shadow banking system can support a variety of investor and corporate needs and enhance the efficient functioning of capital markets. However, since shadow banking activities have been playing a much bigger role in the financial sector than they did prior to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, proper monitoring of credit flows and systemic risks is fundamental to prevent defaults that would endanger financial stability. A legislative procedure on a revised prudential framework for investment firms, which would also attempt to address the systemic risk issue of shadow banking, is now being negotiated by EU legislators.\n\nAuthors:"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/author/josina-kamerling-head-of-regulatory-outreach-for-cfa-institute-for-the-europe-middle-east-and-africa-emea-region/", "text": "Log in to access content and manage your profile.

Ana Lidia Pereira, president of the youth wing of the European People\u2019s Party (EPP), Europe\u2019s biggest party, said no, \u201cwomen should be in those positions because they have the equality, not because of the quota\u201d, adding that it would take time to achieve that.

He was working on a story about the \u2018Ndrangheta, a notorious Calabrian-based mafia group that had crossed into Slovakia. J\u00e1n\u2019s reporting showed the group had deep ties to Slovakian politics and was involved in EU farm subsidy fraud. I had never met him but I knew Holcova was very fond of him.\n\nI remember telling Holcova that this would not stand, that we would act decisively. But I don't think I was convinced of it myself. I felt utterly powerless.\n\nReporters are not supposed to be killed for their work. It\u2019s a breakdown of our values and social norms. The feeling of reporting in an environment where this can happen is a little like painting a house when it is on fire.\n\nJ\u00e1n worked the most dangerous beat, in the nexus of organized crime and politics. It\u2019s a growing area. In some places, it\u2019s all that\u2019s left. Maltese blogger and journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb just a few months before J\u00e1n, was all too familiar with the dangers of it.\n\nCountries like Hungary, Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and most of the states of Central Asia are run by political parties that use organized crime as part of their governing structures.\n\nCriminal groups provide global reach and money laundering skills, not to mention drugs, prostitutes, assassins, and all the other elements of a modern autocratic state. In return, they are protected.\n\nAbout 20 to 30 years ago, organized crime globalized with the help of what we call the \u201ccriminal services industry\u201d \u2014 the Western banks, law firms, registration agents, Golden Visa peddlers, business intelligence firms, hedge funds and lobbyists who service their needs. Through their new friends, these Western actors met corrupt politicians and businessmen from the east. Their expertise opened up new opportunities for corruption and hiding wealth. Everyone became very wealthy.\n\nThese deaths are painful beyond words.\n\nThis profoundly undemocratic money moved to the West, safely laundered and hidden in hedge funds, investment banks, and high-end real estate. It then became increasingly political, investing in everything from Brexit to extremist and nationalist groups. The money has undermined democracy while supporting increasingly plutocratic laws and goals that worked in their favor.\n\nSince most of this crime takes place across international boundaries, and law enforcement is mostly restricted to national boundaries, investigative reporters and civil society groups are the only natural enemy of these bad actors.\n\nJ\u00e1n was part of that family of reporters who track crime and corruption globally. They have almost no resources. They are soft targets and easily killed. Since justice in many of these same corrupt countries is political, those guilty will likely not face full accountability. It's a recipe for more violence.\n\nThese deaths are painful beyond words. Jano was a rare reporter. He had a passion for the work that allowed him to overcome its many challenges. When the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project got access to the Panama Papers, he left so quickly to pour over the files in Prague that he forgot his toothbrush and ended up sleeping on the floor of our partner\u2019s office. He was hell-bent on becoming an expert on freedom of information requests and could coax hard-to-find records out of online databases.\n\nThe death of someone with such talent and personality is an indescribable loss. We miss his passion, his research, his experience every day. He would have written fantastic stories.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I fear more than getting a call like the one I received a year ago, but I know it will come again.\n\nDrew Sullivan is editor and co-founder of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliaments-watershed-moment-election-2019/", "text": "Don\u2019t look now, but the European Parliament has something of a spring in its step.\n\nOnce a mere consultative body, the much-mocked, often-forgotten sibling of the European family has spent the last five years flexing newly discovered muscles.\n\nOn a range of portfolios \u2014 from trade to copyright reforms to emission standards for vehicles to the respect for the rule of law in EU countries \u2014 the Parliament has emerged as an unexpected check on the powers and ambitions of the European Commission and national governments.\n\nThe question now is: What happens next? The European Parliament election in May is expected to be transformative, ushering a new class of MEPs who as a group will be younger and more likely to be Euroskeptic than their predecessors. The new chamber will also almost certainly be the most politically fragmented in the institution\u2019s history.\n\nWill this wave of disruption produce a Parliament that is more confrontational and even more ready to exercise its powers, providing the Council and Commission with even bigger headaches? Or will the institution be rent asunder by its divisions and disagreements and allow its new-found influence to leak away?\n\nWe\u2019ll soon find out.\n\nWarning shot\n\nFrom the buzzy, wall-free TV studios to the visitor groups and advisers marching with purpose in all directions, there\u2019s a feeling in the Parliament\u2019s corridors that the institution has come into its own.\n\nLike legislative bodies everywhere, the Parliament has no shortage of crooks and clowns, but as an organ it also has started to provide deeper scrutiny of the Commission\u2019s proposals than most national parliaments do of their governments.\n\nTake the controversial copyright reform still winding its way through Brussels. The Parliament\u2019s decision to reject a draft of the bill in July served as a warning shot that the institution can no longer be expected to serve as a rubber stamp.\n\nAnd while it was national governments that ultimately had the most influence over the final version of the reform, their positions were in no small part influenced by members of the European Parliament, like the German Pirate Party\u2019s Julia Reda, using their office as a platform to shape the public discourse back home.\n\nThe Parliament has also set itself up for an institutional showdown with the European Council over the selection of the next Commission president.\n\nFew in the Brussels old guard are ready to embrace the Parliament. Commission officials dismiss MEPs as egotistical blowhards. Diplomats gripe about the institution\u2019s free-spending ways. But it\u2019s becoming increasing clear it can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nAmong those who take it seriously is Michel Barnier. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator visits the institution nearly every week with updates on his talks with the U.K.\n\nThough the Parliament has had no formal role in the negotiations \u2014 which have been led by the Commission under a mandate from the Council \u2014 it will get a vote on the final agreement.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s trade mavens are no doubt also watching the chamber closely. Parliament is expected to vote in March on whether the EU should start trade talks with the U.S. While the resolution is non-binding, a resounding \u201cno\u201d would be a bad sign, as any free-trade deal would ultimately need the institution\u2019s blessing.\n\nThe Parliament is also wading into the affairs of national governments. A report by the Dutch Green MEP Judith Sargentini alleging abuses by the Hungarian government ratcheted up pressure on Budapest and the center-right European People\u2019s Party to which Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n belongs.\n\nA vote in September based on the report declared that Hungary is at risk of breaching the EU\u2019s core values and put the country on a collision course with Brussels.\n\nThe Parliament has also set itself up for an institutional showdown with the European Council over the selection of the next Commission president. In February 2018, it declared it is ready to reject any nominee not selected through the so-called Spitzenkandidat system, in which Europe\u2019s political parties pit \u201clead candidates\u201d against each other ahead of the European Parliament election.\n\nWithin weeks EU leaders rejected the Parliament's position: They reserved the right to nominate a Spitzenkandidat, but refused to be limited to choosing from only Spitzenkandidaten.\n\nGrowing Euroskepticism\n\nThe coming election \u2014 and the five-year term that follows it \u2014 will test the Parliament\u2019s ability to maintain its newfound influence.\n\nThe institution\u2019s powers have been built up under a series of EU treaty revisions since 1970. MEPs now have the power to reject the appointment of European commissioners, block trade deals and influence tens of billions in spending each year \u2014 but only if they manage to work together to form majorities.\n\nThe 150 million Europeans likely to cast a vote in the European Parliament election from May 23-26 are set to elect a group of MEPs so fragmented that few of the traditional ways the chamber has operated can be expected to apply.\n\nIn a typical election year, close to half of the Parliament is thrown out by their parties or voters. That\u2019s likely to be the case again in May. Two months before election registration deadlines in many countries, POLITICO has confirmed 190 MEPs are voluntarily retiring. It would be no surprise if 400 new parliamentarians descend on Brussels in June.\n\nSabine Thillaye, of the French parliament\u2019s EU affairs committee, typifies the mood among many of the newer parties vying to make an impact in Parliament: \u201cWe want young MEPs that come from civil society,\u201d she said of her La R\u00e9publique En Marche party\u2019s plans.\n\nBut the new crop of EU legislators will be different from their predecessors in other ways too. Most notably, a large number are likely to belong to populist parties that have been traditionally hostile to the EU.\n\nBroadly, Euroskeptic parties are on track to win 250 of the Parliament\u2019s 705 seats.

Currently, most of the current Euroskeptic MEPs are split into four separate political groups in the Parliament, diluting their influence.\n\nIn the unlikely case that they are able to work together as a bloc, Euroskeptics would be become the Parliament\u2019s largest political group.\n\nWere Salvini to succeed, he will have gathered a force capable of blocking appointments and taking charge of up to six of Parliament\u2019s 20 committees.\n\nEven uncoordinated, the influx of Euroskeptics will be disruptive. Its members will use the chamber floor to rail against the EU, and their sheer numbers will force traditional, pro-EU parties into uncomfortable alliances if they are to adopt measures that might otherwise have been waved through.\n\nJan Zahradil, a European Conservatives and Reformists MEP running for European Commission president, says the price of his party\u2019s support will be the pursuit of \u201cless one-size-fits-all and ever-closer union and more decentralized, flexible \u2014 multispeed, if you wish \u2014 European integration instead.\u201d\n\nFabio Massimo Castaldo, a Parliament vice president and the most senior MEP of Italy\u2019s anti-establishment 5Star Movement, insisted that the major pro-EU parties will \u201cbe forced to negotiate with us on every single file, every single amendment.\u201d\n\nFor the first time since the European Parliament was first directly elected in 1979, Europe\u2019s two largest parties \u2014 the center-right European Peoples Party and center-left Socialists \u2014 are expected to get less than 50 percent of the vote between them.\n\nThis will force the parties\u2019 leaders to bring in other partners, such as the ALDE liberal group or the European Greens. \u201cThis majority with four parties will be much more difficult to sustain and make work,\u201d said Alain Lamassoure, the longest-serving French MEP.\n\nOn some files, Europe\u2019s mainstream conservatives might decide it\u2019s easier to reach out to Euroskeptics to push through legislation.\n\n\u201cThe EPP will need to discuss with us to avoid delays and slow speed in the adoption of legislation,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Meuthen, a German MEP and the lead candidate for the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany.\n\nA different beast\n\nThe nature of the new Parliament will depend on the exact outcome at the ballot boxes, as well as post-election deal-making. But one thing is clear: It won\u2019t make things easier for the Europhiles who have typically been in charge of the Council and Commission.\n\nTo begin with, appointments will likely be pushed through with the slimmest of majorities, with the composition of the Commission shaped by horse-trading among ideological opponents. The selection of the Parliament\u2019s leadership too is likely to be a heated affair, as new forces and old scramble for choice committees.\n\nAs loud and potentially organized Euroskeptics drag EU political debate onto new terrain, fragmentation will likely sap Parliament\u2019s ability to assert the sort of united front needed to do battle with the Council and Commission on legislative issues.\n\nWere Euroskeptics to actually engage in European politics, their role in Parliament could give them a real say over the future of the EU.\n\nWork on some files could get bogged down altogether, if the institution is unable to come up with a position a majority can agree on.\n\nMaintaining the institution\u2019s roles as a regulatory innovator and political provocateur will require the Parliament\u2019s leaders to work together, said Fredrick Federley, a prominent young Swedish liberal MEP. \u201cIn order to get leverage with the Council, we need to stop in-house fighting between committees,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the Euroskeptics are able to band together \u2014 or if some Euroskeptic parties are able to strike deals with mainstream conservatives \u2014 the Council and Commission might find themselves dealing with an entirely different type of beast.\n\nIndeed, they might discover that the Parliament\u2019s power has been trained against them.\n\nBecause of Brexit, few Euroskeptic groups are openly advocating leaving the EU, and so some have set their sights on upending politics in Brussels instead.\n\nGiven their light presence in the Council and the antipathy of most civil servants in the Commission, the Parliament will provide Euroskeptics with the best opportunity to make their voices heard.\n\nSimply forming a blocking minority would be enough to gum up the works \u2014 stopping the next version of the Sargentini report on rule of law in Hungary, for example.\n\nWere Euroskeptics to actually engage in European politics, their role in Parliament could give them a real say over the future of the EU."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-sought-to-pay-its-companies-from-frozen-libyan-funds/", "text": "Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi, who was killed in 2011 | Salah Malkawi/Getty Images Belgium raised \u2018liberating\u2019 Libyan funds as it sought cash for companies The UN has accused country of acting illegally by allowing money to flow from Gaddafi\u2019s accounts.\n\nBelgium asked Libya to settle debts owed to Belgian firms from the Gaddafi era while also raising the prospect of allowing payments from funds frozen by sanctions, a letter from Foreign Minister Didier Reynders has revealed.\n\nBelgium's government is under increasing pressure to explain why it allowed hundreds of millions of euros in interest to flow to unknown recipients from frozen accounts in Brussels that belonged to Muammar Gaddafi's regime, which was toppled in 2011. The U.N. concluded in September that Belgium had broken the law by allowing such payments, which were made between 2012 and 2017.\n\nOne possible explanation for Belgium's decision emerged on Wednesday after POLITICO and Belgian media obtained the letter from 2012, in which Reynders spelled out to the Libyan government that he wanted the bills of Belgian companies to be paid after mentioning the possibility of the frozen funds being unblocked.\n\nReynders wrote to Foreign Minister Achour Ben Khayal that Belgian troops had helped liberate Libya and \"in this spirit\" he now wanted to inform him about Libyan assets in Belgium. He noted the technical possibility \"to liberate\" these frozen assets, and then mentioned debts of a number of Belgian companies, including gunmaker FN Herstal and another business in the defense sector.\n\nIn the letter dated August 1, 2012 Reynders explains to Ben Khayal that there is a \"formal possibility\" under EU sanctions laws \"to liberate frozen assets for inter alia humanitarian objectives.\"\n\nReynders attached a list of nearly \u20ac30 million in outstanding payments to eight Belgian companies. \"In order to settle these arrears, I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with the payment orders for each individual contract. This will undoubtedly improve the conditions related to export finance and facilitate further commercial activities between our two countries,\" he wrote.\n\nIt is unclear, however, whether any of the money ultimately released from the Libyan accounts by Belgium was used to pay these specific debts. David Mar\u00e9chal, a spokesperson for Reynders, said the minister has no knowledge of any decision to unfreeze the funds or whether Belgian businesses had been paid.\n\n\"We don't know anything. It's not the foreign affairs minister that would know this,\" he said. \"The foreign affairs ministry does not unblock money.\"\n\nReynders rejects wrongdoing\n\nIn a letter on February 12 this year to Eric Van Rompuy, chairman of the Belgian parliament\u2019s finance committee, Reynders played down any link between unfreezing of funds and the debts owed to companies in Belgium. He also sought to pass responsibility to the finance ministry.\n\nReferring to the letter to Ben Khayal, Reynders said: \u201cI want to draw your attention to the fact that this letter was written during a period and in a context in which, in accordance with the applicable rules, the possibility to unfreeze these funds for humanitarian projects in favor of the Libyan population was being studied. That required, however, the cooperation of the Libyan authorities,\" Reynders wrote. \u201cI also take the opportunity to repeat once more that the freezing or releasing of funds in Belgium falls under the competence of the finance minister.\"\n\nThe letter is the latest development in a battle over funds belonging to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) but located in Belgium.\n\nSophie Dardenne, director of CK Technology, which sells shooting range equipment and appeared on the list in Reynders' letter, said her company has never received full payment from Libya but this is because business in the country was never carried out.\n\nShe said that CK Technology signed a contract with the Libyan state for \u20ac4.2 million. It received an advance of \u20ac600,000, an amount she said remains blocked in a bank account due to international sanctions.\n\n\"This money is blocked but as the contract was not executed it's logical that it is reimbursed at some point,\" she said, adding that the contract was originally for gear designed to protect Libyan security forces.\n\nOfficials at the Belgian gunmaker FN Herstal \u2014 another company on the list, said to be owed \u20ac536,087 \u2014 did not respond to calls. Other companies on the list were involved in sectors such as poultry, water and satellite communication.\n\nThe emergence of Reynders' 2012 letter is the latest development in an ongoing domestic and international battle over funds belonging to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) but located in Belgium.\n\n\"The Belgian government and European authorities must collaborate with the parliament so that light is shone on this issue\" \u2014 Georges Gilkinet, Belgian Green MP\n\nLast year, a U.N. panel of experts on Libya said that Belgium is in violation of international sanctions targeting the assets once owned by Gaddafi by paying out interest and other earnings from the funds.\n\nThe panel said that considering the instability in the country, the disputes over the authority of the LIA and the lack of an oversight mechanism, unfreezing money \"could lead to the misuse and misappropriation of funds.\"\n\nConfusion around the legal status of the EU's sanctions regime on Libya has played into the dispute over whether the release of the money was in accordance with international law.\n\nA senior EU official said that at a meeting of RELEX, an expert group at the Council of the EU composed of diplomats from member countries, on October 20, 2011, Belgium asked whether the interest on Libya's sovereign wealth generated after September 16, 2011 was not subject to asset freeze. \"The representative of the Council legal service indicated that, in his view, this was the correct interpretation of the EU legal acts,\" the official said.\n\nGeorges Gilkinet, a Green party member of the Belgian parliament\u2019s finance and budget oversight committee, said Reynders has serious questions to answer.\n\n\"Mr. Reynders has always declared that he has not intervened in the matter of unfreezing Libyan funds. We see, however, with his letter to the Libyan authorities that he was at the center of the question,\" he said. \"What was the content of the discussions that he held with Libyan authorities before sending this letter? ... The Belgian government and European authorities must collaborate with the parliament so that light is shone on this issue in which Belgium is the only state not to have respected its international obligations.\"\n\nGilkinet said that both Reynders and Steven Vanackere, who was finance minister in 2012 when the funds were unfrozen, would be summoned to answer questions by the Belgian parliament in March. Vanackere, a member of the CD&V party who is currently a director at Belgium's central bank, has denied knowing anything about funds being unfrozen in Belgium.\n\nHowever, a letter from the Belgian finance ministry to Euroclear \u2014 a financial institution headquartered in Brussels \u2014 dated October 4, 2012 showed Marc Monbaliu, a top civil servant at the ministry, saying that \"the legal department of the European External Action Service of the European Union considers that there is no longer any legal basis to freeze interest on the Belgian funds.\"\n\nRead this next: 3 UK Conservative MPs resign from party"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/top-lithuanian-judges-arrested-in-anti-corruption-crackdown/", "text": "Log in to access content and manage your profile.

The campaign has hired more than 30 full time staffers so far and has begun building out a surrogate network devoted exclusively to putting pro-Trump talking heads on TV and radio \u2014 a move that reflects Trump\u2019s fixation with how he\u2019s portrayed in the media.\n\nTop advisers briefed Trump on the emerging structure Tuesday evening at the White House.\n\nThe setup has the hallmarks of a more traditional campaign associated with a president running for reelection. But coming from this ad-lib president \u2014 whose 2016 effort was wracked by constant infighting that spilled into the press, no apparent organizational structure, and unclear lines of authority \u2014 it marks a major departure from business as usual.\n\nNo organization by itself can inoculate the campaign from the omnipresent drama that\u2019s surrounded Trump since he announced for president four years ago. But the campaign sees the structure as an attempt to run as functional an operation as possible.\n\n\u201cI was one of the few members of the original 2016 team with prior presidential campaign experience. While ultimately successful, the campaign was primarily staffed with inexperienced and untested political operatives and often lacked a cohesive organizational structure,\u201d said Michael Glassner, a presidential campaign veteran who serves as chief operating officer on the reelect.\n\n\u201cFor the 2020 reelection,\u201d he added, \u201cwe have a vastly different operation.\u201d\n\nThe plan isn\u2019t without potential downsides. With such a large payroll at such an early stage of the campaign, the campaign runs the risk of over-spending before Democrats have even picked their nominee.\n\nEven before the hiring spree, the campaign\u2019s spending had drawn scrutiny. The reelect spent $2 million more than it raised between the beginning of October and the end of December.\n\nBut the Trump team had long planned for the early spending. In 2017, Republican National Committee and Trump campaign officials quietly decided to invest over $10 million \u2014 which would have otherwise been spent on midterm races \u2014 on a two-year program to identify small donors. The initiative was used to expand the campaign\u2019s list of contributors, whose donations are being used to finance the Trump 2020 infrastructure.\n\nTo some extent, Trump is simply exploiting the natural advantages of incumbency. Sitting presidents have long used their perch to prepare for reelection by hiring staff, building a fundraising war chest, and developing a national campaign infrastructure.\n\nYet at a time when Trump\u2019s poll numbers have ebbed, the intense early planning also reflects the political peril the president is confronting.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of president and you have to build a structure that supports him in a tough race,\u201d said John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster who advised the Trump 2016 campaign and is expected to work on the reelect. \u201cYou have to be more flexible and you have to be more ready for things that are unexpected.\u201d\n\nThe Trump political world remains deeply unstable and prone to changes in leadership. Many current and former Trump White House officials are convinced there will be turnover at the top as the 2020 campaign intensifies. There's also widespread concern tensions will flare between the campaign and the administration if either side is perceived as making a mistake.\n\nYet the new organization is intended to clarify the decision-making structure. And squarely at the top of that chain is Parscale. Each of the 11 department heads will report to the 43-year-old campaign manager, and he will serve as the main point person for Trump and his family.\n\nThe Trump campaign named three new department chiefs on Tuesday. White House aide Cole Blocker will serve as finance director, Agriculture Department official Tim Murtaugh as communications director, and Marc Lotter, a former adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, as director of surrogates.\n\nTen senior staffers are expected to take up residence in the campaign\u2019s 21,000 square-foot Rosslyn, Virginia headquarters by the end of the month. In total, the campaign expects to have nearly 100 people on payroll by the end of the year.\n\nParscale has quietly been conducting interviews since late last year and has reached out to an array of senior Republicans.\n\nWhile the organization\u2019s tight structure is reminiscent of past presidential reelection bids, Trump aides say the campaign will be non-traditional in some ways. They point out that two digital strategists, Parscale and Gary Coby, have been tapped for senior roles \u2013 an indication that digital and data will form the nucleus of the campaign.\n\nTwo other top campaign aides, meanwhile, have launched an unprecedented effort to stave off mayhem at the GOP convention and to ensure that its a smooth running pro-Trump infomercial. Another top official, Chris Carr, is overseeing a field deployment plan that, for the first time, is being run in conjunction with the RNC.\n\nAnd in another break from precedent, the campaign is planning an early and aggressive effort to brand the Democratic field as being out-of-the mainstream and socialist. The offensive is expected to be spearheaded by a handful of communications staffers working out of the Rosslyn, Virginia headquarters, with assistance from others stationed in swing states.\n\nAt the campaign\u2019s request, the RNC has begun funding video tracking efforts of Democrats while they campaign in early primary states.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re an incumbent,\u201d said McLaughlin. \u201cBut he\u2019s really still a non-traditional president.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-5stars-digital-democracy-struggle/", "text": "ROME \u2014 When Gianroberto Casaleggio, the idealogue behind Italy\u2019s governing 5Star Movement, died in 2016, he left a final gift for his followers \u2014 a pioneering internet platform with the grand aim of bringing direct democracy to the masses.\n\nThe populist movement, which grew out of a blog, has been a pioneer in digital democracy, consulting its online base on candidates, policies and partnerships via Casaleggio\u2019s trailblazing software system, Rousseau, named after the godfather of the French revolution.\n\nBut on Monday, during a vote that threatened to bring down the government, the Rousseau system experienced multiple technical failures, leaving many members struggling to vote.\n\nCritics of the system don\u2019t just question its reliability \u2014 they also charge that it\u2019s not secure or transparent, and that it is open to manipulation.\n\nThe software allows for internal direct democracy, with some limitations. Members of the 5Star Movement can choose between approved candidates for local, regional, national and European elections, suggest and debate new laws and policies, and vote in consultations.\n\n\u201cMany of us are very satisfied because after years of low participation, members have returned to vote in large numbers\" \u2014 Massimo Lazzari\n\nWhen the 5Stars went into a coalition government with the right-wing League last summer, it was put to the vote and received 94 percent support.\n\nOn Monday, Rousseau users got a chance to vote on another big decision \u2014 whether Interior Minister Matteo Salvini should stand trial for kidnapping. Salvini, leader of the 5Stars' coalition partner the League, faced possible prosecution over his refusal to let 177 migrants disembark from the Diciotti rescue ship last year.\n\nThe issue was put to 5Star members ahead of a Senate committee vote on whether to remove Salvini\u2019s immunity from prosecution.\n\nThe stakes were high. Blocking a trial risked alienating 5Star voters by betraying a sacred totem of the movement \u2014 the principle that politicians deserve no special privilege has long been one of their battle cries. But if senators voted to put Salvini on trial, coalition tensions could deteriorate further and cause the government to collapse.\n\nIn the end, 52,000 Rousseau members voted by 59 percent to 41 percent to save Salvini from trial. The movement\u2019s senators followed suit on Tuesday and the Senate committee rejected a request to lift Salvini\u2019s immunity by 16 votes to 6.\n\nSupporters of the Rousseau system saw the vote as a welcome return to the movement\u2019s roots.\n\n\u201cMany of us are very satisfied because after years of low participation, members have returned to vote in large numbers,\u201d said activist Massimo Lazzari. \u201cThere is debate.\u201d\n\nNew platform, old politics?\n\nBut some analysts saw the use of Rousseau as a highly political move to get the leadership out of a bind.\n\nLetting Salvini go to trial could have meant the end of the coalition and an early general election, which the 5Stars are not well positioned to fight. The movement has been dropping in the polls and lost half its support in a regional election in Abruzzo last week.\n\n\u201cA part of the electorate doesn\u2019t accept the relationship with Salvini, but this vote is a way to liberate the leadership from responsibility,\u201d said Raffaele Marchetti, a professor of political science at Luiss University.\n\n\u201cIn principle it is a great concept. It is revolutionary. But in practice it is badly made\" \u2014 Massimo Lazzari\n\nSalvini may not be going before the courts but the decision to hand his fate to Rousseau put the software system itself on trial.\n\nThe poll sparked a volley of internal and external criticism, undermining Rousseau\u2019s credibility as a means of establishing consensus.\n\nThe technical problems left some users unable to cast their ballot for hours. One of those affected was Carlo Rienzi, director of consumer group Codacons. He said: \u201cIt is absurd that a movement that makes transparency and popular participation their battle-cries cannot manage to guarantee participation to its members in a public consultation.\u201d It\u2019s clear that Rousseau \u201cis not capable\u201d of managing this kind of vote, he said.\n\nBut others, such as Rome-based activist Lazzari, support Rousseau, even as they acknowledge shortcomings.\n\n\u201cIn principle it is a great concept,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is revolutionary. But in practice it is badly made, it is clunky and confusing and it always breaks when there is a vote.\u201d\n\nLazzari blamed a lack of investment in the product and lack of transparency over the finances. 5Star MPs are obliged to contribute \u20ac300 a month to the running of Rousseau, totalling more than \u20ac1 million a year.\n\n\u201cThat should be more than sufficient,\u201d Lazzari said.\n\nBlack box\n\nThe system\u2019s lack of transparency also worries some. The computer code supporting the web system is not open-source, noted Marco Canestrari, a former employee of Casaleggio and author of \u201cSupernova, How the Five Star Movement Died.\u201d Direct democracy interfaces used by other groups such as the Pirate Party in Germany have allowed external volunteer web developers to carry out checks and highlight issues with the code, which is usual practice in the tech community.\n\n\u201cThere are literally thousands of ways that a small mistake in the code could theoretically affect the vote,\u201d said Canestrari.\n\nThe Rousseau system has also been shown to be vulnerable to hacking. One hacker, known as @R0gue_0 on Twitter, claimed to have sold the data of tens of thousands of users. This week, he ridiculed Rousseau\u2019s technical glitches on Twitter, while insisting he was not the cause. The Italian data watchdog has expressed concern, issuing a fine of \u20ac32,000 after the 5Stars illegally handed over data on members to third parties.\n\nCritics further complain that Rousseau\u2019s votes are not independently regulated. Jacopo Iacoboni, author of \"The Experiment,\" a book investigating the 5Star Movement, said: \u201cThere is no evidence that suggests that the votes have been manipulated but without third-party regulation we can\u2019t be certain and the poll is not credible.\u201d\n\nTwo previous Rousseau votes have been certified by an independent Norwegian firm, which found that one poll had come under an external attack with dozens of other votes uncertified. But the 5Stars have said that the costs of doing this for every vote are prohibitive.\n\nEven if the software works as it should, Rousseau consultations are still open to pre-digital problems, such as accusations over how the question is posed.\n\nA 2017 vote on allying with Britain\u2019s UKIP in the European Parliament was phrased in a way that left voters confused. Monday\u2019s vote on Salvini was publicized only 24 hours in advance \u2014 not much time to come to terms with a complicated issue, based on constitutional law. And the question was posed in such a way that a \u201cyes\u201d vote meant that Salvini should not face trial.\n\nThere is also little clarity as to when members should be consulted. Officially, the decision is up to the political leader Luigi di Maio. But Rousseau is controlled by Gianroberto Casaleggio\u2019s son, e-commerce entrepreneur Davide Casaleggio.\n\n\u201cWe invented the Renaissance, banking, even fascism. In theory, Rousseau could evolve and go all over the world\" \u2014 Massimo Lazzari\n\nIn the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, such unobstructed access to the data of voters has been increasingly seen as an unreasonable concentration of political power. This is reflected in a fall in the number of Rousseau members from 140,000 to 100,000 \u2014 after many failed to give permission to have their data stored.\n\nBut the 5Stars are now looking to export their system to other European countries. With the European election in May, Di Maio last month tried to re-gift the legacy of Gianroberto Casaleggio to France\u2019s Yellow Jackets, as a precursor to talks on a possible alliance in the European Parliament.\n\nThe refusal of the French was another blow to Rousseau\u2019s credibility. But some voters still have faith.\n\n\u201cRousseau is not great in all aspects, it needs work,\u201d said Lazzari. \u201cBut Gianroberto\u2019s dream was a Rousseau for all, not just 5Star members \u2014 a continual referendum, that\u2019s the final objective.\u201d\n\nItaly is \u201cthe cradle of innovation\u201d he said. \u201cWe invented the Renaissance, banking, even fascism. In theory, Rousseau could evolve and go all over the world.\u201d"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/interactive/optics-the-little-greek-newspaper-that-could-in-turkey/", "text": "Optics The little Greek newspaper that could (in Turkey)\n\nISTANBUL \u2014 A harried man in his fifties darts up and down the narrow alleys around Istiklal Avenue on the European side of Istanbul, carrying packages of tightly folded newspapers in his arms. His name is Sebahattin Esen and though he doesn\u2019t speak any Greek, he\u2019s the longest-working distributor of Turkey\u2019s oldest Greek newspaper, Apoyevmatini (\u201cAfternoon\u201d).\n\nThe paper caters to Istanbul\u2019s Greek community, known as the R\u00fbm, and has been in circulation for 94 years. Today, Istanbul is home to some 600 Greek families, most of whom get a copy of the paper, says Michalis Vasiliadis, its publisher.\n\nLaunched in July 1925, Apoyevmatini was the second paper to appear in the newly established Republic of Turkey, after the Turkish daily Cumhuriyet. Five days a week, it covered the politics of Turkey and Greece, and the goings-on of Turkey\u2019s Greek community. Alongside harder news, readers can find announcements of christenings, graduations and obituaries.\n\nWith the advent of online journalism, the paper also launched an electronic version in 2007. \u201cWe have people reading it in Australia, Canada, Brazil, Belgium, France, everywhere,\u201d says Vasiliadis\u2019 son Minas, the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief. \u201cWe have some young Greek-Americans who, although they don\u2019t speak very much Greek, they buy Apoyevmatini online to show it to their fathers who used to live in Istanbul.\u201d\n\nBut the Greek community isn\u2019t the only one to show a fondness for the publication. When Apoyevmatini was on the verge of shutting down in the wake of the financial crisis in 2010, the Turkish-speaking community jumped in to help.\n\nTurkish researcher Efe Kerem S\u00f6zeri saw a video about the paper\u2019s inevitable closing, and launched a campaign that brought the paper 300 new subscribers, all of whom were Turkish. They couldn\u2019t read the Greek paper but wanted to support it. \u201cIt was very touching,\u201d Minas recalls.\n\nThe future of the newspaper is still uncertain. The number of Greeks who live in Istanbul is dropping and press freedom in the country has \u201cdeteriorated rapidly\u201d in recent years, according to the European Parliament. Still, Minas is determined to keep the publication alive. \u201cI will do everything in my power. After all, Apoyevmatini is part of Istanbul\u2019s cultural history.\u201d\n\nAuthors:"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-orgy-of-psychotherapy-great-debates/", "text": "CORMOLAIN, France \u2014 In a large, bright village hall in a small village in deepest Normandy, 50 angry people want to decide the future of France. They are by turns passionate, funny, deadly serious, rambling, misinformed, confused, concise and intelligent.\n\nIn a political variant of the Tour de France, a nationwide series of \u201cgreat debates\u201d are taking place across the country. Unlike the Tour de France, the ones performing are life\u2019s spectators.\n\nThreatened by the Yellow Jacket movement\u2019s ever-mutating anger and demands, French President Emmanuel Macron dreamed up the \u201cGreat National Debate\u201d in desperation last December. The goal? To allow the French to air their grievances and discuss what has gone wrong in France. To take people away from their internet anger factories and reconnect them to democratic institutions. It has taken off like nothing else in his 21 months in office.\n\nIn Cormolain \u2014 a small town east of Bayeux in Normandy, population 411 \u2014 a small crowd gathered in its new salle de f\u00eates one recent evening to stage their own debate.\n\nDenis, 61, a retired council worker, takes the microphone. \u201cAll you people in Paris, you say you didn\u2019t see the Yellow Jackets coming,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere were you then? Why didn\u2019t you know? Is there no internal intelligence service in France? Are there no local politicians? These problems are not new. The poverty and misery and lack of opportunities in rural areas are not new. Why didn\u2019t you see it?\u201d\n\nMacron certainly seems to have been released from the panic of the early weeks of Yellow Jacket protests.\n\n\u201cMacron has been in government for five years. He\u2019s been president for nearly two years. Why didn\u2019t he know about all this? What is his excuse? Why did he take money \u2014 in diesel taxes, in new taxes on pensions \u2014 from people who have a little and give it to people who have a lot?\u201d\n\nThe debate \u2014 like the almost 3,000 that have already taken place \u2014 is being recorded and transcribed. The results will be given to a committee to be translated into three or four issues for possible legislation \u2014 or maybe, a referendum in June or September. At least 3,000 more meetings are slated to take place before then, and 1 million suggestions or complaints have been posted online. If nothing else, the transcripts will provide a rich seam of material for historians of the future: a kind of French Domesday Book, in which all the county\u2019s most trivial and profound sources of anger or anxiety in 2019 are revealed.\n\nSome have suggested that part of the reason the Yellow Jackets rebellion erupted last November was that the French no longer have many places where they can voice concerns, moan or gesticulate out in the open. There are fewer factories, caf\u00e9s and bars. The Great Macron Talk-In has presented them with an opportunity. It has become a gargantuan radio phone-in: a nationwide orgy of group psychotherapy.\n\n'Life-crushing'\n\nThe grand d\u00e9bat was widely mocked by the French media. The gatherings were boycotted by members of the Yellow Jackets. Perhaps they were right to be skeptical. The debates \u2014 where the four official subjects are taxation and spending; the organization of the state; democracy and citizenship; and the \u201ctransition\u201d to a more ecologically friendly economy \u2014 have helped to noticeably take the wind out of the sails of the movement.\n\nMacron has attended half a dozen meetings himself, taking questions in impressive, seven-hour, shirt-sleeved sessions. Psychotherapy for the head of state? He certainly seems to have been released from the panic of the early weeks of Yellow Jacket protests.\n\nFrench national media have given plenty of coverage to this Macron-splaining. They have taken less interest in local debates like the event I\u2019m attending in Cormolain.\n\nThe first speaker doesn\u2019t give his name. He is 56 years old. We know this because he mentions it several times. It seems to haunt him, as if he has suddenly realized that he is facing the scrapheap. He lost his factory job more than a year ago and has not found another.\n\n\u201cYou contact the unemployment people for help, training or something,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say it may take a year before they can do anything. Fine, but you break the 80 kph speed limit and you get the response through the post from government in two days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always worked. I\u2019m 56 years old. Now there\u2019s nothing at all. No jobs. No factories. It\u2019s all tourism. What is there for me in tourism? I\u2019m 56 years old.\u201d\n\nHe goes on and on. There are cries of anger from the hall. \u201cOK. We\u2019ve got the picture. You\u2019re not the only one.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople blame Europe, but the problem is in Paris\" \u2014 40-year-old woman at Cormolain meeting\n\nA woman in her early 40s, one of youngest people in the room, stands up. She is an organic farmer. She wants to talk about how \u201clife-crushing\u201d it is to deal with the French bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t apply their own rules. They tell you one thing is the law, and then they do something else,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople blame Europe, but the problem is in Paris. There are people sitting there with nothing better to do than to make our lives a misery. They have a great talent \u2014 a talent for splitting hairs 14 times. Lengthwise.\u201d\n\n'We obey the rules. Others don't.'\n\nAn old man near me takes the microphone. His name is Ren\u00e9, a retired farmer in his late 70s, maybe early 80s, and looks like an older Jeremy Corbyn. He has brought a sheaf of hand-written notes.\n\n\u201cI have a pension of \u20ac1,000 a month. I\u2019ll show you the details. You can\u2019t live on \u20ac1,000 a month. And I see all these retired politicians on fat pensions from the state. All the old presidents and prime ministers. That should be abolished for starters. Edith Cresson \u2014 how long was she prime minister? And she\u2019s on a fat pension. I worked hard all my life, but I get \u20ac1,000 a month.\u201d\n\nHe starts to ramble. The meeting grows restless. He finally gives up the microphone, and it goes to an imposing man named Roger, 74, who is a retired farmer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the Yellow Jackets are right or wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019ll say this: Without them, we wouldn\u2019t have got anything. We would have been ignored. The little bit Mr. Macron has conceded we would not have had without the Yellow Jackets. People say they\u2019re violent. I don\u2019t know. I was a farmer. I went on demonstrations, and we knew that there had to be a little bit of violence or no one listened.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn all my years I have never seen a president as arrogant and as ignorant as Mr. Macron,\u201d he adds. \u201cHe comes from a world that doesn\u2019t know suffering and doesn\u2019t understand hard work.\u201d\n\nOthers want to talk about rural transport \u2014 how it\u2019s impossible for poor people to switch from diesel to electric cars; how night work and shift work makes ride-sharing impossible; how there aren\u2019t enough buses.\n\nThere\u2019s talk about farming \u2014 specifically, how worried farmers are about the weedkiller glyphosate, and how impossible it is to farm without it. Other countries will cheat when it\u2019s banned in France from 2022, they say.\n\n\u201cWe obey the rules. Others don\u2019t. We\u2019re like a man running a 5-kilometer race with a 20-kilo sack on his back,\u201d says one participant.\n\n'Envy and jealousy'\n\nMost everyone agrees Paris is too remote, that it refuses to understand the problems of rural areas. Members address the local Macron-supporting MP, Bertrand Bouyx, as \u201cyou people from Paris\u201d even though he is a pharmacist from Bayeux, a town some 25 kilometers away.\n\nThe mood is one of anger and anxiety. People talk about the complexity of modern life, of feeling perpetually cheated. There\u2019s an impressive understanding of some issues, an impatience with others.\n\nThe subjects that don\u2019t come up are as instructive as those that do. There is none of the anti-Semitism or the outlandish conspiracy theories that proliferate on Yellow Jackets social media feeds or \u201canger pages\u201d online. There is little mention of Europe, no mention of immigrants. One of the main Yellow Jackets demands \u2014 that professional politicians be replaced by a system of popular decision-making on the internet \u2014 doesn\u2019t come up at all.\n\nFran\u00e7oise, an auxiliary nurse in her 50s, is one of the last people to speak.\n\n\u201cYes, there is misery, I see it ever day in my work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a lot of envy and jealousy in France. People looking over their shoulder at what others have got. I feel worried for France. This is a wonderful country. I\u2019ve seen what other countries are like. We don\u2019t know how lucky we are sometimes.\u201d\n\nShe makes a plea to those in the room. \u201cPlease no more violence. The shops in town centers are at the end of their tether with all this violence. We need to come together. We need to be grateful for what we have. And yes we need Europe, because a small country like France can\u2019t win on its own.\u201d\n\nMacron will have to cope with the success of the monster he has created.\n\nShe receives a round of applause \u2014 the only one of the night.\n\nAs the meeting wound down, it was clear many people were doubtful whether the grand d\u00e9bat will change anything. And yet, they were relieved to have delivered their fragment of the truth.\n\nMacron will have to cope with the success of the monster he has created. How to synthesize 6,000 meetings? Should the debates be institutionalized, like the citizens\u2019 assemblies that precede referendums in Ireland? How do you synthesize the grievances of thousands of people into legislation or a single referendum question?\n\nThe government will inevitably be accused of using an elephant to give birth to a mouse. I speak briefly to one of the organizers at the end of the debate. \u201cA fiery meeting,\u201d I say. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was calm. I\u2019ve been to others where the shouting never stopped.\u201d\n\nJohn Lichfield is a former foreign editor of the Independent and was the newspaper\u2019s Paris correspondent for 20 years."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eastern-europe-problem-isnt-russia-georgia-abuse-of-power-governance/", "text": "There\u2019s an enemy stalking the post-Soviet states of Eastern Europe \u2014 undermining governments, attacking the economy and sowing instability.\n\nRussia? No. The greatest threat to countries like Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine lies in their own poor governance and abuse of informal power.\n\nAnd while these weaknesses make them more vulnerable to their powerful eastern neighbor, the blame for their consequences ultimately lies at home.\n\nTo be sure, Russian military aggression poses a major threat to Ukraine. Its brazen seizure of three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crew in the Azov Sea last year is a prime example. But this type of open affront is the exception, not the rule.\n\nRecent developments in Georgia provide a good example. U.S. bilateral military assistance \u2014 as well as the long-delayed sale of anti-tank Javelin missiles to Georgia \u2014 has slackened the country\u2019s fear of Russian military aggression and reduced the urgency of its demands for NATO membership.\n\nThese days, the biggest issue in Georgia isn\u2019t threats from Moscow; it\u2019s the political foul play that risks jeopardizing its biggest infrastructure project in years.\n\nIndeed, relations between Russia and Georgia have greatly improved since diplomatic relations were cut off in the wake of the Five Day War in 2008, when Moscow lost direct influence inside Georgia and recognized the two breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n\nThese days, the biggest issue in Georgia isn\u2019t threats from Moscow; it\u2019s the political foul play that risks jeopardizing its biggest infrastructure project in years: a deep-water port at Anaklia on the Black Sea coast.\n\nSlated to open in 2020, the project is intended to cement Georgia\u2019s position as a valuable East-West transit route by allowing it to receive large container ships, and boost its road and rail traffic. The project has attracted international backers: The first phase, costing $600 million, is partly funded by a group of four international lenders, and the European Commission has pledged to help finance the second phase, including road and rail connections. SSA Marine of Seattle, a major U.S. port operator, is set to manage the terminal.\n\nBut its future looks decidedly uncertain.\n\nThe project is closely associated with former Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, who resigned last year after falling out with Bidzina Ivanishvili, another former prime minister and the major backer of the ruling party Georgian Dream.\n\nA recently launched money-laundering investigation into TBC, the bank in charge of the port project, is widely seen as being politically motivated \u2014 payback perhaps by Ivanishvili, who is still the power behind the throne of the new government. The former prime minister\u2019s parochial interests, or those of his business friends, in the rival port of Poti may also be a factor. Last week, the government announced a new expansion project for Poti\u2019s port.\n\nFormally, the government of Georgia has expressed its full support for Anaklia, and the project has a good chance of weathering the crisis. It is too important not to. But the uncertainty created by the power struggle has already created instability and given openings to outsiders seeking to interfere.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no shortage of foreign ill-wishers. For Russia, Anaklia would be a competitor to its own Black Sea ports. It also sits uncomfortably close to their client statelet of Abkhazia, leading one Russian commentator to call it a covert U.S. military project.\n\nTurkey may not be fond of the project either, as Anaklia would be a direct rival to its own ports on the Black Sea. And while the Chinese formally support the project, they are rumored to be less than enthusiastic about its management structure, after their own attempt to own and manage the project was reportedly rebuffed.\n\nSadly, struggles like these are nothing new in Georgia \u2014 informal government and behind-the-scenes power plays have long been a part of how the country is run.\n\nThe analyst Ivlian Khaindrava memorably said of former President Mikheil Saakashvili, much beloved in some circles in the West, that he had a \u201cgovernment by day\u201d that talked to Western interlocutors and a \u201cgovernment by night\u201d that took the real decisions.\n\nGeorgia dropped in the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Democracy Index for 2018 and currently looks like a de facto one-party state governed by Ivanishvili\u2019s Georgian Dream party. Yet compared to other post-Soviet countries in Eastern Europe, it\u2019s doing relatively well.\n\nIt still has checks and balances. Nongovernmental organizations and parliamentarians have just won the first round of another row over the way the country is governed, forcing 10 candidates for the Supreme Court with dubious reputations to withdraw their candidacies after a major public backlash against them.\n\nCountering instances of Russian aggression, especially in Ukraine, is still important. But that is only half the story in these countries.\n\nProblems of corruption and cronyism are writ even larger in Moldova and Ukraine. Moldova in particular looks like a \u201ccaptured state\u201d where business and politics are fused together and large parts of the state are required to serve the needs of powerful individuals, rather than the national interest.

And Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics has filed a motion against the Department of Justice demanding that the agency provide documents pertaining to the legal justification of the president\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\nThe states behind Monday\u2019s lawsuit argued that Trump engaged in an \u201cunlawful scheme\u201d when he \u201cused the pretext of a manufactured \u2018crisis\u2019 of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency and redirect federal dollars appropriated for drug interdiction, military construction, and law enforcement initiatives toward building a wall on the United States-Mexico border,\u201d according to a copy of the complaint obtained by POLITICO.\n\nA White House spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nOne Republican close to the White House said the latest lawsuit satisfies the president\u2019s prediction last week that opponents of his declaration would bring a case in the Ninth Circuit, which boasts some of the country\u2019s most liberal jurists and has become a hot spot for cases against the Trump administration. Trump slammed the San Francisco-based court as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in his remarks on Friday, claiming that he would probably get a \u201cbad ruling\u201d there before the case reaches the Supreme Court.\n\nThe complaint repeatedly underscores the larger political context, arguing that the president is indulging in a \u201cvanity project.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of awkward to say that on Presidents\u2019 Day we\u2019re going to be suing the president of the United States, but sometimes that\u2019s what you have to do,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said during a Monday appearance on CNN, after telegraphing for weeks that he is prepared to take swift legal action if Trump follows through on his repeated vows to invoke an immigration emergency to justify diverting wall funding.\n\nBecerra, who is leading the states coalition, alleges that Trump \u201chas veered the country toward a constitutional crisis of his own making\u201d despite a refusal by Congress refusing to allocate the funds needed to start construction.

Now it's finally happened.\n\nPundits and pollsters are racing to weigh in on the decision of seven Labour MPs to leave their party and sit in the House of Commons as a group of independents.\n\nSome are heralding the creation of the so-called Independent Group as the start of a new political era akin to the one started by Emmanuel Macron in France. Others are predicting that the bid to blow up Britain\u2019s two-party system is bound to end in tears.\n\nThe truth is we\u2019ll have to wait and see. While there are many reasons for doubt, there are also reasons to believe the Labour rebels stand a chance of redrawing the rules and battle lines of British politics.\n\nLet\u2019s start with cold water. To begin with, to pull a Macron \u2014 to come from virtually nowhere to win victory at the polls in the space of months rather than years \u2014 you need, well, someone like French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nIn 21st century politics, leaders aren\u2019t everything. But they still matter \u2014 a lot. At the moment, it\u2019s by no means obvious who among the seven rebels would (or even could) be capable of becoming the face of such an insurgency, never mind its driving force.\n\nIf more MPs join the rebels \u2014 be they Labour MPs fed up or facing deselection or Tory MPs who are increasingly facing the same dilemma \u2014 things could snowball quickly.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s their putative pitch to the electorate. We don\u2019t know what they\u2019re for, only what they\u2019re against: a party they believe has become institutionally anti-Semitic, and that is led by a man disliked and distrusted by many voters.\n\nThey consider Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to be lying to his own overwhelmingly pro-EU mass membership by effectively colluding with Prime Minister Theresa May to deliver Brexit. Going into bat for a second referendum on leaving the EU in the hope of convincing voters to overturn their previous decision might pay dividends in the short term \u2014 but in the long term it won\u2019t be enough.\n\nThere may be a market for a party that is vaguely left-of-center on the economy, but there will be far fewer takers for a party spinning a defiantly liberal line on, say, immigration, crime and welfare.\n\nResources are crucial, too. Not only do parties spend millions of pounds at elections, they are also surprisingly expensive to run between contests. They need tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of members who can contribute at least some of that money, who campaign for them on the ground, who select their candidates and who ultimately help anchor them to whatever worldview they espouse. None of this can be conjured up out of thin air.\n\nNor, of course, can a proportional electoral system \u2014 the one thing that would presumably transform the prospects of any new party. As it stands, Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system constitutes the most hostile environment imaginable. Unless, like the Scottish National Party (SNP), your support is geographically concentrated, winning anything below around 30 percent of the vote means you\u2019ll never win your fair share of seats in the Commons. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) that broke away from Labour in the 1980s found this out to its ultimate cost.\n\nBut while the parallels with the SDP are instructive, the Independent Group\u2019s fate is by no means sealed.\n\nFor one thing, at least among voters, if not among party members, we live in a much less tribal society. As partisan as our era might sometimes seem, political identities are more fluid, and fewer and fewer people are \u201cLabour (or indeed Conservative) through-and-through\u201d these days.\n\nNotions of what\u2019s \"left\" and what\u2019s \"right\" have been disrupted, even eroded, by a politics that revolves as much around culture as economics \u2014 and of course around Brexit, which is a heady brew of both.\n\nThat means there may be more voters up for grabs than many imagine, especially when we consider that many people are turned off by ideology and just want competence \u2014 something they don\u2019t seem to be getting from either of the two main alternatives currently on offer.\n\nMacron may be finding it tough to deliver on his promises right now, but it\u2019s clear he sensed this dynamic. And it\u2019s notable that he won the presidency without a change to France\u2019s similarly non-proportional electoral system.\n\nThe French president also took advantage of the fact that we now live in a 24/7 media cycle with an insatiable craving for novelty. That means any new party, if it gets its messaging and its image right, can attract far more attention far more quickly than ever before.\n\nIf more MPs join the rebels \u2014 be they Labour MPs fed up or facing deselection or Tory MPs who are increasingly facing the same dilemma \u2014 things could snowball quickly.\n\nDigital platforms might also be a big help when it comes to crowdfunding and recruiting new members. Absorbing the Liberal Democrats \u2014 a party whose brand may be bust and whose leader has made no impact \u2014 would obviously provide a massive boost, too.\n\nThe odds on this splinter group turning into a full-blown split seem pretty long right now, and the odds of it resulting in a successful party to rival at least one of the big established parties even longer. But we shouldn\u2019t write off the seven \u2014 magnificent or otherwise \u2014 just yet.\n\nTim Bale is professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nRead this next: Trump can\u2019t run the Mueller playbook on New York feds"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-anti-fraud-office-seizes-400-tons-of-sham-shampoo-china-fraud-eu-olaf/", "text": "An employee straightens a row of Dove shampoo bottles | Tengku Bahar/AFP via Getty Images EU anti-fraud office seizes 400 tons of sham shampoo \u20ac5 million worth of Dove, Head & Shoulders and Pantene was likely on its way to Europe from China via Latin America, says OLAF.\n\nThe EU's anti-fraud office (OLAF) helped seize nearly \u20ac5 million worth of counterfeit shampoo in Colombia and Mexico that was likely headed to Europe, the agency said.\n\nWorking with Spanish customs as well as Colombian and Mexican authorities, OLAF said 400 tons of fake shampoo produced in China had made their way across the globe, being loaded and unloaded from different vessels in a number of ports.

The Independent Group aims to reach across outdated divides and tackle Britain\u2019s problems together,\" their website states.\n\nAll seven are supporters of a second referendum and frustration with leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s reluctance to take that path contributed to their decision to leave.\n\nAnd while it would be wrong to see the split as a solely Brexit-driven event (anger at anti-Semitism in Labour ranks and wider political and ideological differences with Corbyn also played their part) the timing, 39 days before the day the U.K. is scheduled to leave, means that Brexit will utterly dominate the agenda of this new parliamentary group.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the short-term impact on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and its chances of being ratified by the House of Commons will be negligible.\n\nAs supporters of a second referendum, none of the founding MPs are likely to back any Brexit deal unless a public vote is a condition of it passing \u2014 and it\u2019s likely they would have voted along those lines whether in or out of the Labour Party.\n\nBut it is an interesting moment for the wider campaign for that second referendum.\n\nOne key factor to look out for is whether other supporters in the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and even the small number of Conservative backers, rally to the Independent Group as the Brexit drama unfolds in Westminster over the coming days and weeks.\n\nThe MPs have kept their policy platform vague, and even the minimalist branding seems designed to portray the group as a blank canvas that other MPs of different persuasions could potentially feel comfortable joining up with.\n\nMeanwhile, the well-established, cross-party People\u2019s Vote campaign instantly distanced themselves from the breakaway MPs, despite its members being long-standing supporters and, in the case of Chuka Umunna, one of the campaign\u2019s most visible spokespeople.\n\n\u201cWe are not a political party, nor are we ever going to allow ourselves to be associated with just one faction of any political party,\u201d a People\u2019s Vote spokesperson said, going on to suggest that the campaign\u2019s priority remains persuading the Labour leadership to swing behind a second referendum.\n\nThe backing of the Labour Party en masse is, after all, the only realistic route to the House of Commons legislating for a second referendum.\n\nUnder Theresa May, and with a large faction of die-hard Brexiteers, the Tory party will never endorse such an approach.\n\nIt is no wonder then that the People\u2019s Vote group does not want to be associated with the splitters. The seven will be viewed very dimly by the Labour frontbench \u2014 as would a campaign affiliated with them. (\"Sit as independents, vote as independents, fight elections as independents and then independently help the Tories stay in power,\" was one instant reaction from Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth.)\n\nIf anything, there is a risk for Umunna and Co. that their breakaway will achieve nothing more than a hardening of Labour frontbench resolve not to go for a second referendum. The Labour leadership is already mindful of not alienating the half of the population \u2014 and a third of Labour voters \u2014 who backed Leave. Being upbraided for that stance by people who have just quit your party may not be very persuasive.\n\nUmunna himself sees it differently, telling this morning\u2019s press conference that seven MPs leaving his party might help persuade Corbyn to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and get behind a fresh public vote.\n\nAnd the decision to break away now certainly suggests the Independent Group thinks they can influence the manner of the U.K.\u2019s exit (or non-exit) rather than simply plotting a future course for the country outside of the EU.\n\nTheir hope might be that polls will begin to show that the Independent\u2019s Brexit stance is making a large number of voters think about switching from Labour \u2014 and that this will be a powerful inducement to the Labour frontbench to change course.\n\nIt\u2019s a risky strategy and its chance of success \u2014 like so much in Brexit politics over the coming weeks \u2014 profoundly uncertain.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.

They have jurisdiction over the president\u2019s political operation and businesses \u2014 subjects that aren\u2019t protected by executive privilege, a tool Trump is considering invoking to block portions of Mueller\u2019s report. From a PR perspective, Trump has been unable to run the same playbook on SDNY that he\u2019s used to erode conservatives\u2019 faith in Mueller, the former George W. Bush-appointed FBI director. Legal circles are also buzzing over whether SDNY might buck DOJ guidance and seek to indict a sitting president.\n\nThe threat was highlighted when SDNY prosecutors ordered officials from Trump\u2019s inaugural committee to hand over donor and financial records. It was the latest aggressive move from an office that has launched investigations into the president\u2019s company, former lawyer and campaign finance practices. New York prosecutors have even implicated Trump in a crime.\n\nAdd it all up and the result is a spate of hard-to-stymie, legally perilous probes that appears on track to drag on well into Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign. SDNY stands poised to carry on Mueller\u2019s efforts whenever the special counsel\u2019s office closes shop, and it\u2019s likely to draw even more attention if freshly confirmed Attorney General William Barr \u2014 who now oversees the Russia probe as DOJ head \u2014 clamps down on the public release of Mueller\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cWhen you combine their experience with the traditional independence of the southern district and the reputation it has, this is like another Mueller investigation going on,\u201d said Nick Akerman, a former SDNY assistant attorney who also worked on the Watergate prosecution team.\n\nMueller can take credit for spawning significant parts of SDNY\u2019s work. The two DOJ units have shared staff, witnesses and leads, and SDNY has been well-positioned to pick up anything that is outside Mueller\u2019s primary lane of investigating collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nA Mueller referral to SDNY, for example, triggered an FBI raid on Michael Cohen's office and hotel room, according to Cohen\u2019s former lawyer. And the fruits of that raid culminated late last year in Cohen\u2019s guilty plea, in which the longtime Trump fixer and former personal attorney admitted in federal court that Trump directed him to make hush money payments to sway the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe New York federal prosecutors are far from finished. They\u2019re still seeking interviews with Trump Organization executives, according to a source with knowledge of the probe. And Trump\u2019s inaugural committee confirmed earlier this month that it had received a wide-ranging subpoena from SDNY for documents as part of a probe into how the group raised and doled out a record $107 million. Investigators are looking at everything from potential mail and wire fraud to illegal foreign contributions and money laundering.\n\n\u201cThis is why I\u2019ve been saying for months that the Southern District of New York investigation presents a much more serious threat to the administration, potentially, than what Bob Mueller is doing,\u201d Chris Christie, a former New Jersey governor and former federal prosecutor, told ABC News earlier this month.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO on Friday, Giuliani downplayed any broader concerns that his former office posed a wider threat to the president.\n\nElaborating on MSNBC, Christie said that SDNY, unlike Mueller, has \u201cno restrictions on their purview.\u201d\n\n\u201cBob Mueller has a task: It\u2019s Russian interference and potential collision in the 2016 election,\u201d he said. \u201cSouthern District of New York is whatever the heck you want.\u201d\n\nSDNY poses an potent threat because the office has accumulated a perfect storm of witnesses who have guided Trump throughout his career, from his businesses to his meteoric rise in presidential politics up through his inauguration to the White House.\n\nThe list of cooperators includes Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization\u2019s longtime chief financial officer; David Pecker, the CEO of the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company who has admitted to working with Trump for years to kill incriminating media stories; and Rick Gates, who served as Trump campaign deputy and then de facto leader of the inaugural committee. Gates pleaded guilty in the Mueller probe to lying to the FBI last February but his sentencing has been delayed while he cooperates in \u201cseveral ongoing investigations,\u201d according to a filing last month from the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\nThen there\u2019s Cohen, Trump\u2019s longtime fixer who is scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison sentence next month. Christie called Cohen a \u201ctour guide\u201d for SDNY investigators into the president\u2019s orbit.\n\nAnother concern for Trump: SDNY\u2019s independence. Its nickname is the \u201cSovereign District of New York,\" and former prosecutors who have worked there describe its authorities and experience as unique among the nation's 93 U.S. attorney offices.\n\nTrump-appointed officials are also not directly overseeing SDNY\u2019s Trump-related investigations. The president\u2019s hand-selected SDNY head, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, has recused himself from the probes, deferring to a pair of longtime federal prosecutors: Robert Khuzami and Audrey Strauss.\n\nAn SDNY spokesman declined to comment for this story.\n\nAlumni from the office have said SDNY's investigative powers and independent streak are so robust that \u2014 depending on what it finds on Trump \u2014 the office could skirt DOJ legal protocol dating to Watergatethat holds a sitting president can\u2019t be indicted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thoroughly convinced the SDNY will make its own evaluation. They will not say that\u2019s a department policy,\u201d said Jon Sale, a former SDNY and Watergate prosecutor who is close with Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously looking at the president and I wouldn\u2019t rule out that they could decide you can indict a sitting president.\u201d\n\nTrump's attack-Mueller playbook can\u2019t be replicated in New York. For starters, the bounds of what SDNY is looking at don\u2019t deal with Trump\u2019s tenure in the White House, meaning any push back on executive privilege grounds won\u2019t fly. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said they\u2019ve resisted Mueller\u2019s attempts to get the president to answer questions about potential obstruction of justice matters dealing with his time in the Oval Office. And they continue to signal the president\u2019s team should be allowed to review the special counsel\u2019s finished report to ensure it doesn\u2019t violate the president\u2019s rights.\n\nTrump is limited in his abilities to use his bully pulpit against SDNY \u2014 which has nowhere near the name recognition of the special counsel \u2014 in the way he has used Twitter, rallies and even the State of the Union to lambaste Mueller.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the president isn\u2019t concerned about SDNY. Trump reportedly complained about SDNY\u2019s pursuit of Cohen to Matthew Whitaker, his former acting attorney general, though Whitaker last week denied to Congress that the president had chided him.\n\nGiuliani has confirmed Trump\u2019s frustrations with SDNY\u2019s handling of the Cohen probe.\n\n\u201cThe president and his lawyers are upset about the professional prosecutors in the Southern District of New York going after a noncrime and the innuendo the president was involved,\u201d Giuliani, who served as the U.S. attorney leading SDNY for more than five years during the Reagan administration, told CNN in December.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no upside for Trump in attacking the southern district, whereas there might be in attacking Mueller\u201d \u2014 Andrew McCarthy, a former SDNY prosecutor and National Review columnist\n\nBut in an interview with POLITICO on Friday, Giuliani downplayed any broader concerns that his former office posed a wider threat to the president.\n\n\u201cThe same thing will happen as has happened over the last two years with all of these things. They\u2019ll run them down and they\u2019ll find out the president didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Not a darn thing,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nTrump\u2019s complaints about the Mueller probe \u2014 railing against his team of \u201cangry Democrats\u201d and even going after the special counsel himself in more than 70 mentions on Twitter since last March \u2014 have helped the president turn his political base against the Russia investigation. A voters, a record low 13 percent of registered Republican voters reported having a favorable view of Mueller in a recent POLITICO/Morning Consult poll. While that can help the president maintain GOP support in an impeachment battle, legal experts and Trump\u2019s allies have said similar attacks on SDNY won\u2019t matter much should the battleground become a court of law and not the halls of Congress.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one you can\u2019t win,\u201d said Andrew McCarthy, a former SDNY prosecutor and National Review columnist whom the president has cited on Twitter while blasting the Mueller probe. \u201cThere\u2019s no upside for Trump in attacking the southern district, whereas there might be in attacking Mueller.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, SDNY\u2019s efforts have found a allies in Democratic lawmakers who have made the U.S. attorney\u2019s office a key feature of their hearings, floor speeches and in written demands of Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nAhead of Whitaker\u2019s recent appearance before Congress, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler told the acting DOJ head that SDNY\u2019s work would be one of his primary lines of questioning. And in a follow-upletter after the hearing, the New York Democrat pressed Whitaker over his denials that Trump lashed out at him about SDNY. Whitaker\u2019s rebuttals, Nadler said, were \u201cdirectly contradicted by several media reports\u201d and other people with \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d of the calls he got from the White House.\n\nIn a floor speech last week announcing his opposition to Barr\u2019s confirmation, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, warned that any Trump pardons for people tied up in either the Mueller or SDNY investigation \u201cwould represent an abuse of power that would require a response by Congress.\u201d\n\nBarr said SDNY\u2019s work stands on the other side of a red line that he wouldn\u2019t let Trump cross. Pressed by Democratic senators during his confirmation hearing last month, the soon-to-be attorney general said he\u2019d protest the removal of SDNY\u2019s head if he thought the president had nefarious intentions.\n\n\u201cI would not stand by and allow a U.S. attorney to be fired for the purpose of stopping an investigation,\u201d Barr said.\n\nRead this next: Visegrad summit in Israel canceled, says Czech PM"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/on-kosovo-three-presidents-and-a-prime-minister-trump-eu-peace-deal-serbia-vucic-thaci-munich-security-conference/", "text": "MUNICH \u2014 The good news is they got on really badly.\n\nThat\u2019s about the only thing the presidents of Serbia and Kosovo agreed upon after an acrimonious public debate at the weekend that laid bare how hard it will be for them to seal a peace deal, even two decades after the 1998-1999 war between their nations.\n\nBoth Kosovo\u2019s Hashim Tha\u00e7i and Serbia\u2019s Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 said their bad-tempered exchange was useful because it buried any false hopes that they will reach a quick agreement. Still, they face strong Western pressure to push ahead.\n\nIn their discussion at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of leaders, lawmakers and policy experts from around the world at a luxurious hotel, Vu\u010di\u0107 and Tha\u00e7i traded accusations about the war and argued over who is to blame for the current breakdown in the EU-sponsored dialogue meant to tackle their differences.\n\nBut the EU and the U.S. are urging the leaders to get things back on track. Donald Trump has written letters encouraging them to pursue a deal, which would draw a line under the last in a series of wars that tore Yugoslavia apart in the 1990s.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is Kosovo\u2019s status.\n\nFor the EU, an accord would greatly reduce the chances of the frozen conflict between Serbia and Kosovo flaring back to life. Both the EU and U.S. are also keen to bind the Western Balkans closer to the West, thus reducing the influence of Russia, Turkey and other rival powers in the region.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is Kosovo\u2019s status. The territory, whose population is mainly ethnic Albanian, declared independence from Serbia 11 years ago and has been recognized by more than 100 countries. But Serbia regards it as a breakaway province and that view is backed by countries such as Russia, China and five EU members.\n\nWestern leaders hope the end of a long-running dispute between Balkan neighbors Greece and the now-renamed North Macedonia will encourage Kosovo and Serbia to follow suit.\n\nIn Munich, Johannes Hahn, the EU\u2019s commissioner for relations with its neighbors, urged Vu\u010di\u0107 and Tha\u00e7i to aim for a deal before the current Commission\u2019s term ends in the fall.\n\nBut Saturday\u2019s rancorous debate shows just what a tall order that is.\n\nOver the weekend in Munich, POLITICO spoke to three men who will determine how things play out \u2014 Vu\u010dic, Tha\u00e7i and Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj \u2014 as well as Montenegrin President Milo \u00d0ukanovi\u0107, whose country borders both Kosovo and Serbia.\n\nCritics of all four leaders say they preside over \u201cstabilitocracies\u201d \u2014 governments that claim to support Western values but are authoritarian and corrupt. Vu\u010di\u0107 and Djukanovi\u0107 are facing street protests while Kosovo has been hit by strikes. But none of the four looks likely to be leaving the political scene any time soon.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of what they had to say.\n\nAleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107: Looking for a legacy\n\nIn a hotel meeting room on Saturday evening, Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s voice boomed in frustration at some points while at other times he spoke almost in a whisper.\n\nHe made clear he won\u2019t go back to the negotiating table until Kosovo lifts 100 percent tariffs imposed on Serbian goods last November in response to Belgrade\u2019s efforts to block Pristina\u2019s membership of police agency Interpol. But if the tariffs are scrapped, he said, he would go \u201cimmediately back to Brussels\u201d to resume dialogue.\n\nInformed that Haradinaj, the driving force behind the tariffs, had said they would only be removed once a final deal is reached, Vu\u010di\u0107 replied: \u201cI thought that he was irresponsible but not that irresponsible.\u201d\n\nHe called for outside powers to exercise \u201cpositive pressure\u201d on all sides \u2014 making clear they want to see a deal and offering incentives to help bring it about. But he said: \u201cIt\u2019s more about us, Serbs and Albanians, to tell you the truth.\u201d\n\nHe said the two sides have to be free to discuss where to draw a common border \u2014 even though talk of a possible land swap has triggered condemnation in the region and split international powers.\n\nVu\u010di\u0107 played down the EU\u2019s enthusiasm for the idea that the North Macedonia deal could generate momentum for a settlement between Serbia and Kosovo.\n\n\u201cIt shows that Europe needed some good news, more than it is very much relevant regarding the situation between Belgrade and Pristina,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be compared \u2026 It\u2019s 100 times more difficult.\u201d\n\nBut, he stressed, a deal had to be done: \u201cOtherwise we\u2019ll face a catastrophe.\u201d\n\nVu\u010di\u0107 said he is motivated by a higher purpose than day-to-day politics in pursuing a deal with Kosovo that may be unpopular at home.\n\n\u201cI believe in someone\u2019s legacy, that\u2019s what I would like to see,\u201d he said.\n\nHashim Tha\u00e7i: Man in the middle\n\nThe former political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrilla group that fought Serb rule, Tha\u00e7i finds himself in a tight spot.\n\nLast year, he raised the idea of \u201cborder correction,\u201d under which some of Kosovo\u2019s territory may be traded away in an effort to secure a deal. But the deal hasn\u2019t happened and his rival Haradinaj, a former KLA commander, has won popular support for imposing the tariffs on Serbia and ruling out any border change.\n\nSpeaking to a small group of reporters in a corridor of the Munich hotel, Tha\u00e7i made clear he takes a softer line on the tariffs than Haradinaj. He suggested they could be dealt with in a parallel process while talks over the peace deal resume.\n\n\u201cPolitics is about being creative,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if Kosovo was now speaking with two voices, he switched from Albanian to English to reply: \u201cWe have one voice \u2014 everybody\u2019s for dialogue, for negotiation, and for the agreement.\u201d\n\nOn his relationship with Haradinaj, he said: \u201cEven inside a family, people have differences \u2026 We were co-fighters and we won the war and we worked for the independence together and now we work for the final agreement.\u201d\n\nAlthough Kosovo\u2019s parliament has now established a negotiating platform that rules out border changes, Tha\u00e7i declined to say the idea is off the table.\n\n\u201cWe have to come to an agreement on where the border is, and recognize each other\u2019s border,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s tough on-stage rhetoric, Tha\u00e7i said he is unmoved. \u201cI\u2019m used to his drama and his acting,\u201d he said.\n\nTha\u00e7i is likely relying on international pressure to get Haradinaj to move on the tariffs and help ensure he retains a big say in any negotiations with Belgrade.\n\n\u201cWe must listen to the advice of the United States and the EU,\u201d he said.\n\nRamush Haradinaj: The hard-liner\n\nThe battle between Haradinaj and Tha\u00e7i has further complicated efforts to reach a deal. Both men are lobbying hard for support from European and American politicians, with international public affairs companies advising them.\n\nIn an interview on Saturday, Haradinaj didn\u2019t hold back. He took aim at EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini for not ruling out border changes and said Tha\u00e7i has no choice but to drop the idea. He said Serbia should see recognizing Kosovo as a moral duty, to atone for killings and other war crimes by Serb forces.\n\n\u201cRecognition should be coming as an apology for tragedies caused to our country, our people,\u201d he said.\n\nHaradinaj said it would be \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d for Tha\u00e7i to pursue border changes now that parliament has agreed its negotiating stance.\n\n\u201cHe has not much room to maneuver,\u201d he said of the president. \u201cHe will find his way to cope with that.\u201d\n\nHaradinaj said Mogherini\u2019s stance on border change is a \u201dbig mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe harmed not only our region but Europe as well,\u201d he said, suggesting the idea would be seized upon by Russia's Vladimir Putin to redraw boundaries on the territory of the old Soviet Union.\n\nDespite his hard-line rhetoric, Haradinaj said \u201cwith political will, an agreement is possible this year.\u201d\n\nMilo \u00d0ukanovi\u0107: Worried neighbor\n\n\u00d0ukanovi\u0107 has held power far longer than even other regional veterans such as Vu\u010di\u0107 and Tha\u00e7i. His party has been in government continuously since 1990.\n\nHe suggested the international community should have stuck to the line that border changes are taboo. Some countries, such as Germany, still support that stance but the U.S. and the EU have given Belgrade and Pristina the green light to explore changes.\n\n\u201cThis whole story about the change of borders has now been put on the table and I would say it got a certain level of legitimacy from the international community,\u201d \u00d0ukanovi\u0107 said.\n\nHe referred back to the wars of the 1990s, during which nationalists advocated drawing borders along ethnic lines. (Both \u00d0ukanovi\u0107 and Vu\u010di\u0107 were allied early in their careers with Serb nationalist leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 before switching to pursue more pro-Western foreign policies.)\n\n\u201cEveryone should be very, very careful when presenting any solution that involves a change of borders in our region,\u201d \u00d0ukanovi\u0107 said.\n\nHe said the North Macedonia deal shows what could happen when leaders on both sides conclude a deal is in their interests. But he said even if Kosovo and Serbia reach a settlement, there will be an even tougher nut still to crack.\n\n\u201cAfter this problem, we will be left with the most serious problem in the region, that\u2019s Bosnia,\u201d \u00d0ukanovi\u0107 said. The peace deal that ended the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is widely seen as having left the country with a highly dysfunctional political system.\n\n\u201cWe will have to deal with Bosnia in a much more serious way \u2026 with a wider range of participants,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be very complicated to find a formula for Bosnia.\u201d\n\nRead this next: Trump can\u2019t run the Mueller playbook on New York feds"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/andrej-babis-visegrad-summit-in-israel-canceled-says-czech-pm/", "text": "Log in to access content and manage your profile.

The EFDD is projected to make a net gain of two seats despite losing its 17-member contingent of anti-EU British MEPs from the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP). However, the EFDD's future was cast into doubt last week when 5Star leader Luigi Di Maio announced the creation of a new group \"of like-minded people\u201d featuring parties from Croatia, Finland, Greece and Poland. The new gathering so far falls short of the number of MEPs and countries represented needed to form an official group.\n\nThe poll numbers, unveiled on Monday, deliver an alarming \u2014 if not entirely shocking \u2014 wake-up call to the mainstream, pro-EU politicians who have controlled power in Brussels for decades, but have seemed flummoxed in recent years about how to push back against a rising populist and nationalist tide.\n\nProjected losses are even more devastating for the mainstay center-left Socialists and Democrats.\n\nOverall, the anti-EU groups will control more than 14 percent of Parliament \u2014 not enough yet to challenge the mainstream groups but potentially presenting a formidable obstacle in some legislative debates. The poll results also show that at least three parties will be required to form a majority coalition of pro-EU forces in the next Parliament, with the center right and center left no longer able to break the 50 percent threshold on their own.\n\nThe long-dominant, center-right European People's Party, while still remaining the biggest group, is projected to lose 34 seats, falling to 183 from 217, and bringing its total share of seats in the Parliament to 26 percent from 29 percent.\n\nProjected losses are even more devastating for the mainstay center-left Socialists and Democrats. They are projected to fall to 135 seats from 186, bringing their share to 19 percent from 25 percent of the chamber.\n\nCurrent polls show the party will be hit hard in Italy (where it is on track to lose 16 seats), Germany (a 12-seat drop) and France (a 7-seat drop). If French Socialists fall by a further two points, they would be wiped out altogether on election day.\n\nThe Parliament projection is close to POLITICO's own predictions. The main differences: POLITICO predicts 176 seats for the EPP compared to the 183 predicted by the European Parliament. POLITICO predicts 68 seats for Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), excluding any French MEPs from Emmanuel Macron's La R\u00e9publique en Marche, compared to the 75 predicted by Parliament.\n\nThe projection of the new European Parliament relies on surveys selected and collected by consultancy Kantar Public, their national partners, and the Parliament's public opinion monitoring unit and liaison offices.

Signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, the treaty is regarded as one of the crucial steps toward ending the Cold War.\n\nWhile the U.S.'s NATO allies acknowledged the legal basis for Washington\u2019s move to withdraw, concern over what will happen next was palpable at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend. The Europeans were hoping for some indication of what the U.S.\u2019s next move would be, but went home none the wiser from the annual gathering of leaders, ministers and policymakers from around the world.\n\n\"We cannot start another nuclear arms race,\u201d Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said in an interview with POLITICO, urging an immediate effort to build a new treaty that would also include China. \u201cWe need a comprehensive agreement on nuclear weapons with all stakeholders. What does Mr. Trump want? No agreement at all? This is not our view.\u201d\n\nSecurity analysts say the real reason Donald Trump pulled out of the treaty was over concern that China, which is not bound by the INF, could deploy precisely the type of weapons Washington was banned from producing.\n\nMost observers are skeptical that the administration has any plans to send such weapons, which the U.S. has yet to even make, to Europe. Such deliberations would only antagonize the Russians and worry the Europeans, said Sam Nunn, a former U.S. senator who worked closely on nuclear disarmament policy in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\u201cWhere would you deploy them?\u201d he asked. \"It\u2019s a lose-lose situation.\u201d\n\nNunn was part of a group that came to Munich to urge leaders to try to preserve and modernize the INF. But given the unpredictability of the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy and the Continent\u2019s deep distrust of the U.S. president, reaching transatlantic consensus on a new approach won\u2019t be easy.\n\n\u201cOn the most important threats we've been discussing \u2014 climate change, multilateralism, the rise of China, terrorism, the war in Syria, trade \u2014 wherever you look there's complete disagreement between the States and Europe,\u201d Borrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a divorce in values.\u201d\n\nEuropean officials warned that the vacuum created by the treaty\u2019s lapse could put their security at risk by reigniting the nuclear competition between the U.S and Russia with the Continent caught in the middle. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and other leaders took pains in Munich to reassure the public that the U.S. has no intention of stationing mid-range nuclear weapons in Europe in response to the treaty\u2019s collapse.\n\nIn Germany, where the stationing of mid-range nuclear missiles at the height of the Cold War in the 1980s created deep political divisions and sparked violent mass protests, the issue is stirring old ghosts. Some Social Democrats have even suggested it is time to rethink the country\u2019s nuclear alliance with the U.S.\n\nEven Angela Merkel, a leader not known to sow fear, made little effort to hide her deep concern over the issue.\n\n\u201cTo be perfectly honest, for us Europeans the really bad news of this year is the cancelation of the INF Treaty,\u201d the German chancellor told the conference in a keynote address, voicing frustration over Europe\u2019s powerlessness to do anything about it. \u201cThe answer can\u2019t lie in a blind race to build more weapons.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and Russia have six months to resurrect the treaty, but most observers say that\u2019s unlikely. Given Russia\u2019s investment in new missile technology, it would take a \u201cmiracle\u201d to preserve the INF, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds said in an interview.\n\n\u201cFrankly, Russia possesses those missiles, they are deployed and they're violating the INF Treaty,\u201d he told POLITICO, arguing that European concerns are more about symbolism than strategic reality.\n\n\u201cIt looks bad because one of the iconic treaties of the beginning of the end of the Cold War is over, but why do we need a treaty that\u2019s not enforced?\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone violates it, it's dead anyway.\u201d\n\nRead this next: Theresa May sets course for Brexit disaster"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/andreas-norlen-sweden-riksdag-order-swedish-style/", "text": "Sweden's Andreas Norl\u00e9n confesses that one day he'd love to let rip like John Bercow in Westminster.\n\nWhile the speaker of the House of Commons has been entertaining the world with his raucous attempts to impose \"Order!\" on guffawing British MPs during Brexit debates, Norl\u00e9n has quietly guided the Riksdag through an unprecedented deadlock that saw Sweden bereft of a government for 134 days.\n\nFollowing September's inconclusive election, the speaker of the Riksdag oversaw seven rounds of talks with the political parties and two failed votes for prime minister, and held six meetings with King Carl XVI Gustaf, until finally four months later the incumbent Stefan L\u00f6fven secured a second term.\n\nThe negotiations, while long and acrimonious, were carried out with such characteristic Swedish calm that one broadcaster, TV4, juxtaposed riotous clips of Bercow with Norl\u00e9n's history-teacher demeanor and asked on its homepage: \"Mild or wild: How do you like your speaker?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s allowed to applaud in the Swedish parliament but not to boo. So our sessions are slightly calmer than the sessions in Westminster,\" Norl\u00e9n told POLITICO in an interview. \"It would be fun though, I think, some time to bellow a bit, but I think it would be met with astonishment in the chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really hard to tell what will happen during the coming three and a half years\" \u2014 Andreas Norl\u00e9n\n\nNorl\u00e9n, a 45-year-old member of the conservative Moderate Party, was elected speaker a day before L\u00f6fven, whose party came first in the election but fell far short of the numbers to form a working coalition, lost a vote of confidence in the Riksdag on September 25 (though L\u00f6fven remained as caretaker leader).\n\n\"I simply had to hit the ground running, initiate the process and just muddle on,\u201d said Norl\u00e9n.\n\nThe new government line-up that finally emerged last month breaks the mold in Swedish politics: L\u00f6fven's Social Democrats and their Green allies won the highly conditional support of the Center and Liberal parties, plus limited support from the Left Party.\n\nWith just 167 of the 349 seats in the single-chamber parliament (plus 28 from the Left), the new alliance is probably the weakest government in Swedish democratic history with the exception of a minority Liberal government in 1978 that lasted less than a year. The situation is a bitter irony, given that Sweden is currently celebrating 100 years of full democracy.\n\nThe Swedish speaker is fully aware that his toughest challenges may still be waiting.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really hard to tell what will happen during the coming three and a half years,\" said Norl\u00e9n, who was speaking on a trip to Brussels to visit the European Parliament.\n\nOne challenge has been the rise of the nationalist Sweden Democrats, whose anti-immigrant, tough-on-crime rhetoric earned them third place in September. They now have 62 seats in the Riksdag, behind the the Social Democrats on 100 seats and the Moderates on 70 seats, but ahead of the Center, Left, Christian Democrats, Liberals and Greens.\n\nThe increased weight of the Sweden Democrats, who threaten to upset the cozy tradition of the center-left and center-right blocs alternating in power, sparked debate about whether it is still appropriate for the dominant Social Democrats and Moderates to divide up the key parliamentary committee chair posts between them. With all the main parties still shunning the far-right party, it was a foregone conclusion.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion of the parties after a discussion, which was to some extent open in the media, was that they should not be included. So the two traditional blocs continue to share those posts,\u201d said Norl\u00e9n. He emphasized, however, that seats on the committees are awarded proportionally and that during the government negotiations he received party leaders \"according to their strength in parliament, so Jimmie \u00c5kesson from the Sweden Democrats was always No. 3.\u201d\n\nDespite the weakness of the current government, Norl\u00e9n believes the loosely bound alliance should be able to pass key legislation because, in order to block something like the budget, the Sweden Democrats and Left would have to agree, \"and that is not very likely to happen,\" he said, with another touch of understatement.\n\nHe believes the intense public scrutiny of the negotiations served to undermine the myth \"that people don\u2019t care about politics.\"\n\nThe Riksdag may not have all the pomp and circumstance of Britain's parliament, but Norl\u00e9n \u2014 who collects coffee mugs with political logos from across the world \u2014 seems to relish his role as much as Bercow. He expresses a touch of pride in the way Swedish democracy coped during four months of uncertainty without tipping over into a crisis: The state continued to function, parliament produced a budget for 2019, and there were \"no protests on the streets or anything like that \u2014 no turbulence.\"\n\nAnd although the entertainment value was less obvious than Westminster's antics, he believes the intense public scrutiny of the negotiations served to undermine the myth \"that people don\u2019t care about politics.\"\n\n\"I think this autumn in Sweden shows quite the opposite \u2014 people did care about how their government was formed,\" said Norl\u00e9n.\n\nRead this next: A transatlantic (atomic) blast from the past"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/iranian-foreign-minister-mohammad-javad-zarif-grabs-munich-security-conference-spotlight/", "text": "MUNICH \u2014 The U.S. is trying desperately to isolate Iran, but on Sunday Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif seized the stage of the world's premier security conference.\n\nHe held the audience of power-brokers rapt for nearly 40 minutes as he thrashed the Trump administration, fired a pointed demand at Europe to do more to protect their nuclear deal, and generally painted a portrait of Tehran's worldview that at times drew chuckles for defying reality.\n\nIt was a striking performance, conducted in fluent and colloquial English, that quickly became the most talked-about presentation at the annual Munich Security Conference \u2014 for its bluntness, its audacity, and its timeliness. Zarif capitalized on tensions in transatlantic relations, exploited President Donald Trump's unpredictable and erratic foreign policy decisions, and generally played on the jangled nerves of policymakers unsure how to handle an array of new threats.\n\nHe also braided all of the main threads together in issuing a blunt demand that EU powers do more to preserve the nuclear deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), following Trump's withdrawal and reimposition of economic sanctions. \"Europe needs to be willing to get wet if it wants to swim against the dangerous tide of U.S. unilateralism,\u201d Zarif declared, demonstrating not only his comfort conversing in English, but also an ability to turn its idioms to his advantage.\n\nHis forthright presentation, and willingness to spar with the moderator \u2014 BBC chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, who repeatedly challenged him and sought to hold Iran responsible for military aggression and other extraterritorial misdeeds \u2014 delighted organizers of the annual conference, who had been hoping for just such a vivid confrontation.\n\nHe opened with a frontal assault on U.S. policy toward Iran.\n\nZarif's performance came three days after senior Trump administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, convened a global conference about the Middle East in Warsaw, where they had sought to rally international sentiment against Tehran.\n\nBut Zarif's speech in Munich and his aggressive replies in the question-and-answer session showed the Tehran government utterly unbowed.\n\nHe opened with a frontal assault on U.S. policy toward Iran.\n\n\"We have never been forgiven by the United States for having exercised our right to self-determination,\" he said. \"As a result, we have long been the target of an unhealthy fixation, let's say an obsession, which continues to this very day. The demonization of my country has been a convenient cross for seven consecutive American presidents to bear, and an even more convenient smokescreen for America's regional clients to hide behind.\"\n\nThen, Zarif launched into his complaints about the JCPOA, capping them with a mocking line about the Warsaw event.\n\n\"These guys have had the illusion that Iran would evaporate for 40 years. But we are still here.\u201d\n\n\"In the past two years, the U.S. has taken its animus toward Iran to a new extreme,\" he said.\n\n\"At a recent meeting of, let me just call it the unwilling and the openly coerced, in Warsaw, the U.S. vice president and the secretary of state both blasted Europe on European soil for even attempting \u2014 albeit without much success \u2014 to abide by its obligations under the JCPOA.\"\n\nPence indeed demanded in Warsaw that the European guarantors of the JCPOA \u2014 France, Germany, the U.K. and the EU \u2014 abandon it, and he repeated that demand again in a speech at the Munich conference. Pence's demand, which American officials said was issued at the request of Trump \u2014 was quickly and flatly rejected by the Europeans, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said in Munich that the JCPOA had succeeded in constraining Iran's nuclear weapons program.\n\nIn his speech, Zarif accused Washington of trying to topple the Iranian government, and of sending its military 10,000 kilometers from home to destabilize the Middle East. He pointed to U.S. actions in Iraq and Syria and also Trump's support of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cI think the U.S. administration is not doing anything but regime change,\" he said of Washington's policy toward Iran. \"These guys have had the illusion that Iran would evaporate for 40 years. But we are still here.\u201d\n\nCiting what he described as a pervasive threat from the U.S., Zarif made an impassioned case for Iran to have the right to defend itself, while chiding the Americans for arming Iran's rivals in the Middle East and also railing against both the U.S. and Europe for taking issue with Iran's ballistic missile program. Going back in history, he recalled Europe had armed Iraq when it was at war with Iran in the 1980s.\n\n\"We believe it is in our interest but we believe it is at the same time in the interest of Europe to stay in the deal.\"\n\n\"I ask you a question: Does Iran have the right to defend itself?\" he said. \"And if we have the right to defend ourselves, do we do it with swords? Do we do it with, whatever, guns? Or do we need sophisticated means of defense?\n\n\"The most sophisticated means of warfare are being sold to our region and President Trump conveniently calls them beautiful military equipment,\" he said, sneering. \"Now we are not getting any of those beautiful military equipment. The beautiful military equipment, the Yemenis are getting. They are being killed with it. I don't think they call it beautiful.\"\n\nAt another point, he asked: \u201cDoes Iran have to simply lie dead simply because some people don\u2019t want us to be able to defend ourselves?\u201d\n\nFor the EU, some of his most crucial remarks were on the nuclear deal. Preserving it, as the Europeans hope, requires Iran maintaining compliance. And Zarif complained that the so-called special purpose vehicle set up by the EU to allow European countries to keep trading with Iran despite U.S. sanctions falls short of what Europeans had promised \u2014 to normalize economic relations.\n\nAsked how long the deal could survive, he replied, \"I am not a fortune-teller so I don't know.\"\n\nBut he also said Iran's patience is limited and suggested public support was fragile.\n\n\"Now the polls are at about 51 percent,\" he said. \"We are just at the brink \u2014 51 percent of the people believe that we still should be in JCPOA while 80 percent of the people believe that we didn't get anything from it.\" He added, \"We believe it is in our interest but we believe it is at the same time in the interest of Europe to stay in the deal.\"\n\nPushing back on U.S. pressure, the Europeans have said that other issues, including concerns about Iran's missile program and at least two state-sponsored assassination attempts on European soil, should be addressed separately from the JCPOA, and they formed a new group called the E4, including Italy, to discuss those matters.\n\nZarif called on the Europeans to stand up to Trump \u2014 and he even showed an ability to make up an English word in the process.\n\nEarlier this month, the Council of the EU issued written conclusions, formally expressing concern about Tehran's role in Syria, its missile use and \"hostile activities that Iran has conducted on the territory of several Member States.\" The Netherlands, France and Denmark have all accused Tehran of plotting attacks in Europe over the past year.\n\nThe Dutch government alleges that Iran organized two assassinations of Dutch-Iranian activists in 2015 and 2017. Denmark has said it foiled a Tehran-led plot to kill an Arab-Iranian opposition figure on its soil last year. France suspects Iran was behind a failed attack on a rally of an exiled Iranian dissident group near Paris in 2018. Iran denies any involvement in the plots.\n\nZarif said EU sanctions imposed on two Iranian individuals and an organization over the incidents were \u201csanctions based on allegations, not based on fact.\u201d\n\nHe noted that an arrest in one case took place the same day that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani arrived on a visit to Europe last year \"after many months of preparation.\"\n\n\u201cDo you think we're really crazy? That we do this on that day? At least we\u2019d do it a day before, a day after, 10 days after. Wouldn't I? We do it on the day our president comes here? Give us some credit,\u201d he said.\n\nPressed on the issue, he offered a range of possible explanations \u2014 but none of them involved the Iranian leadership.\n\n\u201cIt could be a false flag operation. It could have been an entrapment. It could have been a rogue operation, but it is certainly not the work of a government that you should call crazy if it did it. And you don't gain the influence that we have by being simply crazy.\"\n\nAt one point, when pressed about the arrests of dual nationals in Iran, Zarif insisted that the Iranian government could not exert any authority over its judiciary, which he proclaimed independent. That assertion drew disbelieving laughs from the audience.\n\nPerhaps most pointed, in trying to capitalize on transatlantic tensions, Zarif called on the Europeans to stand up to Trump \u2014 and he even showed an ability to make up an English word in the process.\n\n\"This is an outrageous demand,\" he said of the insistence that Europe abandon the nuclear deal. \"If the United States were to come in the course of their fight with China and told Europe stop dealing with China. What would you do? Whatever you want to do then, do now, in order to prevent that eventuality.

Trump said Russia has been violating the accord for years. Moscow has level counterallegations that it is the U.S. that broke the agreement.\n\nWhoever is at fault, a new generation of world leaders is now confronting a collapse in the nonproliferation infrastructure that has been in place for decades, and that many of them had taken for granted throughout their careers.\n\n\"My generation of politicians has not had to deal with a discussion over nuclear security, how we control these risks because these treaties have always been there\" \u2014 Kersti Kaljulaid\n\nKaljulaid said she attended a panel discussion on the issue at the conference on Saturday with a sense of urgency to study up.\n\n\"I went to learn,\" Kaljulaid said, speaking at a corner table in the basement pub of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof, where the security conference is being held. \"My generation of politicians has not had to deal with a discussion over nuclear security, how we control these risks because these treaties have always been there.\"\n\nKaljulaid, who is 49, said she is eager to learn from former elected leaders including the ex-Irish President Mary Robinson and former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn.\n\n\"The generation of people like Mary Robinson or Sam Nunn, [former NATO chief] Javier Solana, they are still among us,\" she said. \"They still keep coming to these conferences and they remember the risk analysis which propelled them to action and how the achievements of these treaties were got to.\"\n\nBut Kaljulaid said it is not clear others share her keen sense of urgency.\n\n\"I went specifically to learn and I have to say the room was pretty empty,\" she said. \"I think we need to wake up and learn a lot.\"\n\nKaljulaid said she is not particularly focused on the bickering between Russia and the U.S. over who is more to blame for collapse of the INF. Estonia, like other members of NATO, has declared Russia to be at fault for developing and deploying a new mid-range missile in clear abrogation of the agreement.\n\n\"It wasn't for me the star moment,\" she said of debate on who was to blame, \"because I do know that there are very different opinions of who did what to the INF Treaty.

Nunn has said that risks of misunderstanding leading to a potential nuclear conflict have risen to \"dangerous levels.\"\n\nIn the interview with POLITICO, Kaljulaid said she also senses an opportunity to shift the conversation from a bilateral discussion between Washington and Moscow to a multilateral discussion that would also include Europe's nuclear powers: the U.K. and France.\n\n\"If you look now into the face of the situation, that was a treaty of which Europe was not a party,\" she said of the INF. \"We have nuclear powers and we have territory over which this treaty is supposed to provide a protective umbrella.

Trump also has said he wants to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, raising questions about the role America will continue to play against battling the Islamic State terrorist network.\n\nA former White House official said the withdrawal is another example of the White House announcing nominees before fully completing the vetting process.

He said the threat of no-deal is concentrating minds on both sides of the Channel.\n\n\"My own view is that what is driving the process at the moment is the sense of a deadline. It is the fact that that deadline is there that is getting the movement that we're seeing in Brussels,\" the finance minister said.\n\n\"As people start to look at and contemplate the possibility of a no-deal exit, and the damage that would do to the U.K.'s economy and its standing in the world, they become more and more prepared to look at how we build that compromise which takes us forward with a deal,\" he said. The Bank of England has predicted that U.K. economic output could drop by as much as 8 percent in a no-deal scenario.\n\n\"There is always the possibility of no-deal as an outcome. I, and my colleagues, are absolutely committed to avoiding that outcome,\" Hammond added.\n\nThe chancellor also said there is no guarantee that the EU27 would approve any U.K. request to extend Article 50 beyond the March 29 Brexit date to give more time to reach a deal. \"It would be quite high-risk just to assume that Brussels would grant an extension, if it was sought,\" he said.\n\nAsked if the U.K. has asked whether an extension request would be granted, the chancellor said that in international negotiations, it is normal for each side to play their cards \"close to their chest.\"\n\n\"Bear in mind that the European Union isn't a single entity. It's 27 member states marshalled together in a Council herded by the Commission. It's not an agile or easy structure to be able to bring to complex decisions. How the EU would react to any request around [an] extension of time would depend entirely on the circumstances,\" Hammond said.\n\n\"I fully recognize that it is very uncomfortable that we are as close to the wire as we are, but I'm afraid that's just a feature of this kind of negotiation,\" he added.\n\nThe chancellor also rejected the notion that the Tory party has been overrun by a faction of right-wing Brexiteers who have been allowed to act as a \"party within a party.\" That assertion was made yesterday by three Conservative MPs who resigned from the party in order to join the fledgling Independent Group in parliament.\n\nHe accepted that \"there is a small hard core that have a very hard line view and are not likely to be flexible or to want to compromise,\" but added, \"No, they are not winning.\"\n\nRead this next: Moscovici: Commission will reopen budget discussions with Italy"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-tusk-hell-comment-was-to-get-brexiteers-attention/", "text": "European Council President Donald Tusk | Aris Oikonomou/AFP via Getty Images | Aris Oikonomou/AFP via Getty Images Donald Tusk: \u2018Hell\u2019 comment was to get Brexiteers\u2019 attention European Council president says Brexiteers did not expect their victory and so were not prepared for it.\n\nDonald Tusk said his Brexit \"hell\" comment was a \"deliberate exaggeration\" to get the attention of those responsible for setting the U.K. on its Brexit course without a plan, adding that not all behavior on the U.K. side had been \"rational.\"\n\nTusk was talking about his remark at a press conference in Brussels two weeks ago that there was a \"special place in hell\" for Brexiteers who had embarked on Britain's EU exit without a plan.\n\n\u201cThose who promoted Brexit, they did not in fact believe in their victory, so did not prepare themselves in the slightest degree for this victory,\" Tusk told Polish news channel TVN24 on Wednesday evening, without mentioning any of the Leave campaign's leaders by name.\n\n\"My words were strong, but I deliberately used this exaggeration to get the attention of those who are really responsible for the fact that now all of us on both sides of the English Channel live in suspense when it comes to Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe European Council president expressed bemusement at the decision of the U.K. parliament to reject the deal agreed between London and Brussels in November. \"Together with Prime Minister Theresa May we prepared a very good and safe deal and it appeared the British reject it and do not propose anything instead \u2026 Not all the behavior on the British side is rational on this issue.

The French government has advised Brits to apply for a residency permit, but Bourne is waiting for some health insurance paperwork. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go through in time, and nothing more is officially decided, then in theory from the start of April I\u2019ll be living in France illegally,\u201d he said.\n\nIslanders with second homes on the Continent, such as Janie Corbet and her husband Jeff, both 64, could also be affected.\n\nThe Corbets married in France in 1977 before returning to Jeff\u2019s home island of Guernsey in 1985.

Rasmussen warned on Friday.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Russia will be a major malign actor,\u201d Rasmussen told POLITICO in an interview on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.\n\nAt the same time, it is \u201cimportant to realize that other malign actors might have learned lessons from the Russian playbook, including China or Iran,\u201d he said.\n\nRasmussen now runs a private consultancy and in 2016 became an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s President Petro Poroshenko \u2014 a role suspended in the run-up to the country's presidential election in late March.\n\nThe former NATO chief and ex-Danish prime minister said that efforts to meddle in the campaign will involve creating unrest by amplifying existing political divisions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an ideological war from Russia, it\u2019s not a left-wing or right-wing oriented campaign, but the campaign aims at undermining trust and confidence and initiates chaos and instability,\u201d said Rasmussen.\n\nRasmussen added that there will be efforts to spread disinformation by using \"deep fakes\" \u2014 doctored videos or audio recordings that make a person seem to say or do something that they never said or did.\n\nBut some European national governments are ill-equipped to counter those efforts, Rasmussen said.\n\n\u201cWe have 27 countries participating in that election and they are not equally well-prepared \u2026 to avoid and prevent foreign meddling.\u201d\n\nNaming and shaming\n\nOver the weekend, Rasmussen will launch an open call by 14 current and former political leaders \u2014 including former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, former Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n and former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves \u2014 for those running in the European election to sign a pledge in which they promise to adhere to certain principles to counter foreign meddling.\n\nThis, he said, will include pledging not to use stolen data, not to spread doctored audio or video material, to disclose the use of bots in campaigns, to train staff in cybersecurity, and to make campaign financing public.\n\nThe idea behind the open call is to raise awareness among candidates and to \"name and shame\" those who don't follow the rules.\n\n\u201cPolitically, it would be quite suspicious if a political party or candidate would not subscribe to those common-sense principles,\u201d Rasmussen said.\n\nHis \u201cTransatlantic Commission on Election Integrity\u201d initiative, which is funded by governments and corporations such as tech giant Microsoft, is also working on a toolkit that would allow media companies as well as social media platforms to identify \"deep fakes.\"\n\nTo develop the necessary technology, the group has partnered with London-based AI company Faculty, formerly known as ASI Data Science, Rasmussen said.\n\nThe idea, he said, is to allow different actors to better understand what's authentic and what's likely a fake, and to boost transparency.\n\n\u201cIf two days before a general election, a 'deep fake' video is broadcasted, then you [as a media company] can ... say to the viewer that there is a very high probability that

pear parfait for dessert, but a concession on the Northern Ireland backstop was most certainly not on the table.\n\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, spent Monday evening dining with his (relatively) new British counterpart, Stephen Barclay, at the British ambassador's residence in Brussels.\n\nBarclay is the U.K.'s third state secretary for exiting the European Union since the Brexit process started. Indeed, Prime Minister Theresa May seems to go through negotiators faster than Barnier and Barclay went through bottles of Sancerre and Saint-\u00c9milion wine at their dinner. But Barclay may have arrived for the best part \u2014 with the March 29 deadline fast approaching and a final, crucial deal on the U.K.'s departure still waiting to be clinched.\n\nBarnier, leaving the dinner on Monday, described the discussion with Barclay as positive, but declared yet again that the withdrawal treaty agreed in November would not be reopened or renegotiated.\n\n\"Constructive talks,\" he told reporters outside. \"It is clear from our side that we are not going to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, but we will continue our discussion in the coming days.\"\n\n\u201cI found Corbyn\u2019s letter interesting in tone and in content\" \u2014 Michel Barnier\n\nEarlier in the day, while visiting Prime Minister Xavier Bettel in Luxembourg, Barnier amped up the pressure on May by making the EU's most openly positive remarks about a proposal by May's archrival, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, for Britain to remain within the EU's customs union.\n\n\u201cI found Corbyn\u2019s letter interesting in tone and in content,\u201d Barnier said. His remarks were even more pointed given that May, in a conciliatory letter to Corbyn on Sunday night, appeared willing to consider all of his proposals with the one, notable exception of staying in the customs union.\n\nBarnier's comments in Luxembourg followed similar praise for Corbyn's proposal from European Council President Donald Tusk during his meeting with May in Brussels last Thursday. In that conversation, Tusk noted that Corbyn's proposal \u201cmight be a promising way out of the impasse,\u201d an EU official said.\n\nA proposal to stay in the EU customs union would be precisely the type of significant shift in U.K. red lines that EU leaders have said would be necessary to change the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. They have also been looking for any indication of cross-party cooperation in London that might offer promise of a national consensus emerging on the U.K.'s post-Brexit future.\n\nWithout such consensus, EU officials expect negotiations on the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU could potentially be even more tortuous than the negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement. And they have adamantly refused to make concessions on the Northern Ireland backstop \u2014 designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland \u2014 because they are convinced that such shifts would put the EU single market at risk while not sufficiently bridging the divisions on the U.K. side to assure ratification of the withdrawal treaty.\n\nBarnier underscored those concerns and frustrations in Luxembourg, saying: \"Something has to give on the British side.\u201d\n\nThe dinner on Monday night was held in Brussels, but the menu at the ambassador's residence offered a culinary tour of many corners of the United Kingdom and its sovereign seas. The wine, however, in just a slight bit of deference to Barnier, was French.\n\nIn a readout of the meeting, a British official wrote that Barclay and Barnier met to discuss \"the next steps in the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU and explore whether a way through can be found that would be acceptable to the U.K. Parliament and to the European Union.\"\n\n\"The meeting was constructive,\" the official added, \"and Mr. Barclay and Mr. Barnier agreed to further talks in the coming days and that their teams would continue to work in the meantime on finding a way forward.\u201d\n\nRead this next: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gives Brexit cocktail recipe"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/french-media-gender-equality-faces-hard-truths-after-metoo-moment/", "text": "As of Tuesday, eight journalists from five news organizations were suspended or had quit as a result of the harassment claims | Etienne Laurent/EPA Reporter's Notebook French media faces hard truths after #MeToo moment Series of online bullying allegations highlights boys\u2019 club mentality in French newsrooms.\n\nFrench journalists are looking at themselves in the #MeToo mirror, and it\u2019s not pretty.\n\nThe French media industry was left reeling after a series of allegations of online bullying implicating high-profile journalists broke over the weekend, revealing a destructive boys' club mentality at the heart of France\u2019s most prestigious newsrooms and a serious blindspot about issues of gender and discrimination.\n\nAs of Tuesday, eight journalists from five news organizations \u2014 all of whom were members of an informal group called La ligue du LOL \u2014 were suspended or had quit as a result of the harassment claims.\n\nA number of them held top management positions in prominent newsrooms. All were young white men. The victims who spoke up were young journalists and bloggers, mostly women, some of them outspoken feminists. The fact that the group was active for years, but until last week didn't attract scrutiny, has led to a great deal of industry soul-searching.\n\n\u201cThe treatment inflicted to several young women and men by some members of an informal group called \u2018the LOL league\u2019 is heart-sickening,\u201d Laurent Joffrin, the executive director of left-leaning newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, wrote in an editorial this week.\n\n\u201cBetween 2011 and 2013, I sustained repeated cyber harassment that started, every time, by tweets or messages from a member of the LOL League\" \u2014 L\u00e9a Lejeune\n\nJoffrin knows what he is talking about. His newspaper was put in the awkward position of breaking the story \u2014 it did so in a slightly goofy way, formulating the revelations as a response to a letter from a reader \u2014 and playing a part in the scandal itself. The paper hosted two of the alleged harassers: Vincent Glad, a freelancer for Lib\u00e9ration who founded the group, and Alexandre Hervaud, the editor of Lib\u00e9ration\u2019s web platform. Both have been suspended pending further investigation.\n\nNoticeably, most of the alleged harassers worked for publications that supported the #MeToo movement and gave it extensive coverage \u2014 all while being oblivious, it seems, to their own reporters\u2019 behavior.\n\nOnline 'raids'\n\nSeveral journalists and bloggers, most of them female and in junior or precarious positions at the time, have described a sustained harassment campaign during the early 2010s. They were allegedly attacked via social media, blog platforms, through phone calls and, in at least one case, physical intimidation.\n\n\u201cBetween 2011 and 2013, I sustained repeated cyber harassment that started, every time, by tweets or messages from a member of the LOL League,\u201d L\u00e9a Lejeune, a reporter at business magazine Challenges who was then working at Lib\u00e9ration, wrote in an account of her personal experience for Slate. \u201cThere were \u2018raids\u2019 organized around some feminist tweets or articles that I was posting online.\u201d\n\nMembers of the accused group sought to make amends over the weekend in a series of apologetic messages.\n\n\u201cWe called it trolling, it was harassment,\u201d Glad wrote in a two-page message shared on Twitter. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that we shut down, with our jokes, the first feminist voices when they appeared on social media around 2011-2012.\u201d\n\nGlad, now 33, gained notoriety as a columnist for a popular TV show in 2012 but was first known among his peers as a young Twitter star \u2014 he now has over 140,000 followers \u2014 and a web savvy reporter.\n\nSo were Lib\u00e9ration editor Hervaud and other members of the group, including David Doucet, the editor-in-chief of cultural magazine Les Inrocks' online platform (he has now been suspended), who admitted to pranking then junior TV producer Florence Porcel.\n\nThe LOL League started as a private Facebook group in 2009 anchored by Glad, and soon spread to an active online community partly made up of anonymous members. Most of the activity took place on Twitter, where waves of disparaging comments mentioning targeted individuals were posted. A flurry of anonymous accounts typically followed the lead of group members' pointed and repeated jokes. Stephen des Aulnois, the head of the porn culture online magazine Le Tag Parfait, admitted to photoshopping a blogger's head onto a pornographic image and posting it on Twitter, where it was then retweeted multiple times. Several bloggers have described experiencing something similar.\n\nThe group included journalists but also young professionals from the advertising and publishing industry.\n\n\"These men\u2019s careers were really built up on the back of [their alleged victims]\" \u2014 Aude Lorriaux\n\n\u201cThe LOL League really had an impact on women journalists\u2019 careers, with their skills being put into question,\u201d said Aude Lorriaux, a freelance journalist, writer and spokesperson for Prenons la une (\"Let's take over the front page\"), a group that advocates for gender equality in newsrooms and more visibility for female journalists. \u201cSome women were blacklisted on Twitter, had to leave social media. These men\u2019s careers were really built up on the back of [their alleged victims].\u201d\n\nThe 'cool guys'\n\nTwitter was the \"place-to-be\" during these years for aspiring journalists, Samuel Laurent, now an editor at Le Monde, wrote Monday in a Facebook post.\n\n\"It was there that talents were spotted, that you had a chance to get noticed. I probably partly owe the fact that I was hired at Le Monde to my active participation on this platform. In this context, of course, 'cool kids,' influential ones, and this small group specifically, were in a position to make and destroy reputations, and probably early careers.\"\n\nHis post echoes a feeling many French journalists launching their careers in Paris had at the time \u2014 myself included.\n\nI worked in digital newsrooms from the start, first in Slate as an intern \u2014 alongside Vincent Glad who was a staff reporter there at the time \u2014 then as a breaking news reporter at Le Monde and later franceinfo's online platform. And although I never experienced online bullying first-hand, I definitely felt that a small number of young \u2014 mostly male \u2014 web reporters \"owned\" the Twitter space.\n\nThey were ruthless when it came to making fun of those who weren't web savvy enough \u2014 or just not cool enough. It made me self-conscious about jumping in, although I couldn't have pinpointed what, specifically, was holding me back. Neither did I, like many of my colleagues, realize the extent of the harassment happening in replies to tweets or in blog post comments.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we speak up during all this time? Because these people had high-ranking positions, were friends with editors-in-chiefs or people in managing position at Slate, Lib\u00e9ration, Les Inrocks, in gossipy media outlets,\u201d Lejeune said. \u201cIn a precarious position, we were afraid of losing job opportunities.\u201d\n\nGlad, Hervaud and others were the \"cool guys\" with whom other young journalists wanted to be friends. They were attractive because they had visibility and access \u2014 real or perceived \u2014 to influential figures despite their relatively junior positions at the time.\n\nDays after the LOL League story broke, French media also published reports of similar harassment taking place in private messaging groups in the French newsrooms of Vice last year and Huffington Post several months ago.\n\nIn both cases, the groups\u2019 chats were exposed internally \u2014 and members dismissed \u2014 after female managers were appointed, something Lorriaux of Prenons la une said \"is not a coincidence.\"\n\nWomen accounted for only 40 percent of management positions in French newsrooms in 2017, according to the most recent figures.\n\nParadoxically, some of the U.S.-born outlets that are in turmoil today were instrumental in fostering the feminist debate in France.\n\nBut the problem is not limited to the media industry. \u201cThis boys' club logic is everywhere, not only in journalism,\" said Lorriaux, describing young male professionals in other sectors climbing up the corporate or political ladder partly as a result of informal all-male social groups. \u201cFemale politicians told us exactly the same thing.\u201d\n\nThe country has also been slow to catch up with the political and academic debate on gender studies or discrimination happening elsewhere. In France, that discussion has only taken shape over the past few years. \u201cAt the time [of the alleged bullying], we were touching upon feminist concepts that had barely started to emerge in the French public debate: patriarchy, rape culture and manspreading,\" Lejeune, the Challenges reporter, wrote.\n\nParadoxically, some of the U.S.-born outlets that are in turmoil today were instrumental in fostering the feminist debate in France. \u201cSpinoffs of American news websites like BuzzFeed, Slate and the Huffington Post imported journalistic fields linked to feminism and anti-racism,\u201d Lorriaux said.\n\nNow they \u2014 along with traditional media outlets \u2014 need to wrestle with the kind of culture they want to foster not only out there, but also in their own newsrooms.\n\nMarion Solletty is deputy policy news editor at POLITICO.\n\nRead this next: Way to an Italian populist\u2019s heart is through his stomach"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/france-fears-loss-of-influence-in-next-eu-parliament-les-republicains-socialists-national-rally/", "text": "French MEPs fear they soon won't matter much.\n\nFacing heavy losses in May's European Parliament election, France's two traditional major parties risk becoming just bit-part players in the two biggest blocs in the chamber.\n\nThat, in turn, will mean fewer influential posts for lawmakers and less clout in the Parliament for one of the EU's big powers and founding members.\n\nBoth the conservative Les R\u00e9publicains and the Socialist Party (PS) have been hit hard by the rise of Emmanuel Macron and his centrist party. The PS is in particularly dire straits, polling at only around 5 percent. If it falls below that threshold in the election, it will not send any MEPs at all to the next Parliament.\n\n\u201cThe risk is that the left is so deeply divided that there won\u2019t be any French person to represent it in the Parliament,\u201d said a staff member from the French delegation of the center-left Socialists & Democrats (S&D) bloc in the legislature. \u201cWhat we're facing is a catastrophe.\u201d\n\nThe loss of big-hitters will also mean a lower media profile for French MEPs back home.\n\nAccording to POLITICO's latest projection based on opinion polls, the party that won 13 seats in the last election would drop to five seats in the next Parliament \u2014 as part of a 133-strong Socialists & Democrats group. That's a serious comedown for the party that has produced pioneers of the European project such as Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Jacques Delors.\n\n\u201cWe are going to lose a lot of MEPs,\u201d said Christine Revault d\u2019Allonnes-Bonnefoy, a Socialist MEP who has been mentioned as a possible candidate to lead her party in the May election. \u201cRight now, we are doing the job, we\u2019re getting on with things. It\u2019s not enough, but I don\u2019t have any magic wand to change things.\u201d\n\nCenter-left parties are struggling across much of Europe but they are finding the going particularly tough in France, where the left has fractured into multiple parties and movements.\n\nMEPs like Isabelle Thomas, Guillaume Balas and Edouard Martin have quit the PS to join \u201cG\u00e9n\u00e9rations-s,\u201d a left-wing party created by former Socialist presidential candidate Beno\u00eet Hamon. Others like Emmanuel Maurel joined the far-left France Unbowed led by former MEP Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon.\n\nRight off\n\nThings are looking only a bit better for Les R\u00e9publicains. They are forecast to win 11 seats in the Parliament, compared to 20 in the last election five years ago, making them a small presence in a European People's Party (EPP) bloc of 176 MEPs.\n\nLes R\u00e9publicains have been in trouble since their candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon's presidential campaign imploded in 2017. The party now appears weak, divided and largely inaudible on EU affairs. Some of its senior European parliamentarians are set to bow out of the chamber, including Alain Lamassoure, Michel Dantin and Fran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate, who has been an MEP since 1994. The future of Elisabeth Morin-Chartier, another high-profile MEP from the party, remains unclear.\n\n\u201cNot long ago, we had 30 MEPs from a list led by Michel Barnier,\u201d lamented Morin-Chartier, referring to the former European commissioner and current Brexit negotiator. She said the party needs \"a regiment of MEPs who are recognized in France and must be influential here in the Parliament.\u201d\n\nAlso contributing to the gloom among MEPs from Les R\u00e9publicains is the Euroskeptic tone often struck by the leadership under party chief Laurent Wauquiez.\n\n\"Their call to reform Europe has become a mantra, and shows the total ignorance of everything that has been carried out in the last five years when the right has led the governing majority in Europe,\u201d Grosset\u00eate told the French magazine Le Point in an interview last month.\n\nThe current projections suggest Les R\u00e9publicains would constitute a smaller delegation within the EPP than Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, while the once-mighty French Socialists would bring the same number of seats to the S&D table as Denmark's Social Democrats.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nBeing a sizeable national delegation inside a big group in the Parliament means wielding considerable clout. In recent years, French MEPs have pushed for progress on issues that France regarded as priorities, such as a revision of the rules on EU citizens working temporarily in another EU country, the sharing of airline passenger records and the removal of online terror content.\n\nAlthough the next European Parliament is projected to be more fragmented than the current one, the EPP and S&D are on course to be the largest groups once again. If French MEPs are only small factions within those groups, they stand less chance of winning senior posts \u2014 such as committee chairs and policy coordinator roles for their blocs \u2014 and of driving the legislative agenda.\n\nCoordinators are crucial as they are appointed for two and a half years thanks to their seniority and experience to act as spokespeople for their group in the Parliament's legislative committees.\n\nFrance currently has two coordinators in the S&D group \u2014 veteran Socialist Pervenche B\u00e9r\u00e8s in the Economic Affairs Committee, and Virginie Rozi\u00e8re, another Socialist who is a coordinator for the Petitions Committee. It also has several vice coordinators like the EPP's Arnaud Danjean in the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nBut only Danjean is almost certain to stay on as an MEP, as a leading candidate for Les R\u00e9publicains. Ber\u00e8s is set to leave the chamber in May while Rozi\u00e8re's fate is unclear.\n\nThe loss of big-hitters will also mean a lower media profile for French MEPs back home.\n\n\u201cThere will be fewer people in France to explain what the Parliament does for voters,\" said the French S&D official. \"The two big European parties will be inaudible [in France], and that will only strengthen extreme forces.\u201d\n\nAnother Parliament official said the decline of the traditional parties could contribute to a greater imbalance in the Franco-German relationship at the heart of the EU. France would not be able to count so much on its MEPs to \"convince their German counterparts\" in the big groups, the official said.\n\nThe main beneficiaries of the travails of Les R\u00e9publicains and the Socialists are Macron's La R\u00e9publique En Marche, and an array of Euroskeptics from both the left and right, with Marine Le Pen's National Rally foremost among them.\n\nEuroskeptics would be bolstered by 35 French MEPs \u2014 21 from the National Rally, eight from the far-left France Unbowed and six from the nationalist Debout la France.\n\nPro-EU politicians will take some comfort from the fact that Macron's party is forecast to win 20 seats in May's election. But it will almost certainly not be part of the two biggest groups. Instead it has formed a tentative alliance with the liberal ALDE group, which is predicted to win 68 seats. Most of its MEPs will also be inexperienced, making it harder for them to claim many senior posts in the Parliament or in a group.\n\nRead this next: Europe must avoid another East-West missile race"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/5-fights-between-france-and-italy-yellow-jackets-luigi-di-maio-emmanuel-macron/", "text": "Paris recalled its ambassador to Rome on Thursday \u2014 the last time that happened was in 1940, when Italy declared war on France.\n\nThis time it was \u201crepeated, baseless attacks\u201d from the ruling Italian parties that caused France to make its diplomatic move.\n\nIt's been a long time coming for two countries that each consider themselves the best at everything, from food to fashion to football. The French \u201clove to show off, they are smug even if they are weak,\u201d wrote the right-wing Italian daily Libero in an editorial.\n\nBut it's the French who have been the strongest. Over the past 20 years, French companies have bought Italian rivals, from the dairy producer Parmalat to the fashion maker Gucci. There has been speculation for years that Generali, one of the few big multinationals left in Italy, could merge with French rival Axa.\n\nThings came to a head when Italy\u2019s populist government of 5Stars and the League came into office last summer and identified French President Emmanuel Macron as the symbol of the pro-EU establishment it wants to destroy.\n\nHere are just five of the most recent spats between Paris and Rome:\n\n1. Yellow Jackets\n\nThe provocation that seems to have tipped the French over the edge was when Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5Star Movement and deputy prime minister, met with leaders of the Yellow Jackets movement in Paris.\n\nIn a post on Facebook Thursday, Di Maio wrote that Paris \u201chas attacked several times the Italian government\u201d in the run up to the European election in May, and added that the meeting \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent a provocation\u201d toward the French government because Macron\u2019s En Marche movement meets with Italy\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nThe 5Stars had already publicly expressed their support for the Yellow Jackets, whose initial protests against a fuel tax morphed into a general anti-Macron movement.\n\nBefore recalling its ambassador, France played it cool: \"We don't want to take part in the race for who is the most stupid,\" French Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau said. \"With Italy we have many things to do and we want to continue doing them.\u201d\n\n2. Migration\n\nAlessandro Di Battista, one of the leaders of the 5Stars, told a TV show that tackling the problem of monetary sovereignty in Africa is the only way to solve the migration problem in Europe. Di Battista claimed that because the CFA franc \u2014 the currency used by 14 sub-Saharan African nations \u2014 is printed in France and has a fixed exchange rate against the euro, France effectively controls those countries that use it and has taken their sovereignty away from them.\n\nThe 5Stars say their attack is based on work by Massimo Amato of Bocconi University, but Amato said they have misunderstood him. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici \u2014 a Frenchman \u2014 said at the last Eurogroup meeting of eurozone finance ministers that talk about the currency was \u201cirresponsible ... provocation and we don\u2019t want to take these kind of statements seriously because that\u2019s exactly what the authors want.\u201d\n\n3. Libya\n\nThe catalyst for many of the current problems came in 2011 when then French President Nicolas Sarkozy pushed for military intervention in Libya, a former Italian colony from where Rome still gets much of its oil.\n\nFor many in Rome, Paris had gone too far. They blamed the French for leading the charge that led to an increase in the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean and then for abandoning Italy when the consequences needed to be faced. This was a spat that began before Macron took office but it's been exacerbated since then. In May last year Macron called a meeting with Libyan factions in Paris while Rome was in the middle of a political crisis after an inconclusive election (the populists came into office a few days later). The meeting \u201cwill be a nice photo-opportunity [for Macron], to us it will create a big disappointment,\u201d an Italian diplomat was quoted as saying in the left-leaning La Repubblica.\n\nWhile this was going on, the center-left Italian government of the time led by Paolo Gentiloni was trying to defuse tensions and was working on a new treaty (the Quirinal treaty) with France. It was meant to be like the 1963 Elys\u00e9e Treaty that laid the ground for new ties between France and West Germany. Officials say the planned new treaty is now in the deep-freeze.\n\n4. High-speed train line\n\nParis and Rome are also at odds over a controversial railway project to link Turin and Lyon. The 5Stars are strongly opposed to the \u20ac8.6 billion project, and on Tuesday gave the now-recalled French Ambassador Christian Masset a cost-and-benefit analysis that shows that Italy would incur a net loss of \u20ac7 billion if it were to go ahead.\n\nThe French government was not impressed. France has already dug 25 kilometers into the Alps, and further delays could push Brussels to reduce EU funding for the project, an amount that currently stands at \u20ac400 million. France would like Italy to make up its mind and respect its international commitments: \u201cThere are deadlines that require decisions to be taken in a timetable compatible with the mobilization of European funding,\u201d said Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne last week while visiting the construction site in Savoie. The Italian government said it will discuss the project with Paris, but no date has yet been set, an Italian transport ministry spokesperson said.\n\n5. Leonardo da Vinci\n\nEven art isn't immune from the Franco-Italian fighting. The Louvre wants to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s death in October. In 2017 the Italian government agreed to lend the Paris museum much of the work it owns by Da Vinci. But that might now not happen. \u201cLeonardo is Italian, he just died in France,\u201d said Lucia Borgonzoni, Italy\u2019s undersecretary of state for culture, in November. \u201cHe's not called Leonard\u00f2, as they call him, but Leonardo,\u201d she added while announcing her intention to renegotiate the deal.\n\nSilvia Sciorilli Borrelli and Paola Tamma contributed to this story.\n\nRead this next: The Brexit prisoner\u2019s dilemma\n\n"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/german-conservative-cdu-leader-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-europe-must-adapt-to-survive-christian-democratic-union/", "text": "Europe must change to prosper in a \"contest of systems\" with China and the United States, according to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the new leader of Germany's ruling Christian Democrats.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, Kramp-Karrenbauer sketched out a vision that would mean changing EU competition policy to create \"European champion\" companies, giving greater weight to industrial policy, and striking a balance between French President Emmanuel Macron's calls for greater EU integration and the more cautious approach of Berlin and other member countries.\n\n\"What I see and feel is that the world is reordering itself, that old certainties are falling away. I see the challenge for Europe in setting the standards in this process,\" said Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was elected in December to succeed Angela Merkel as chair of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), putting her in pole position to also take over from Merkel as German chancellor.\n\n\"I'm not entirely sure that we are aware of this challenge and sufficiently prepared for it,\" said the 56-year-old former premier of Saarland state, whose low-key style inevitably draws comparisons to Merkel, though her profile is more socially conservative.\n\nTurning to May's European Parliament election, Kramp-Karrenbauer said the CDU aims to contribute to a majority of \"constructive European forces\" in the EU legislature. Alongside the European People's Party, of which the CDU is a key component, she said that majority could include socialists, liberals, Macron's centrist La R\u00e9publique En Marche and possibly Greens \u2014 but not populists on the right or left.\n\n\"Europe cannot be only the receiver of strategic decisions of others, that is China or the USA. We have to be strong ourselves to shape the global rules\" \u2014 Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer, known as AKK for short, spoke to POLITICO in Brussels on her first visit to the EU capital as CDU leader. The trip was a chance for Kramp-Karrenbauer \u2014 a relative newcomer to national and European politics, having spent most of her career in Saarland \u2014 to get better acquainted with EU officials and members of the European Parliament.\n\nIt was also an opportunity for them to get to know her, after 18 years of Merkel at the helm of the Continent's most important political party. A senior center-right MEP reported strong demand among his colleagues for selfies with the new boss, and there was a long queue for face time at a Brussels reception given for her Tuesday.\n\nThe interview took place on the eve of European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's decision to block a planned merger between Germany's Siemens and Alstom of France that would have created a European rail industry superpower. Advocates of the tie-up, including the French and German governments, argued Europe needs a company that could compete globally in the sector, particularly with China. Opponents said it would squash competition in Europe and create an inefficient behemoth.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer made clear she is in the former camp.\n\n\"Europe cannot be only the receiver of strategic decisions of others, that is China or the USA. We have to be strong ourselves to shape the global rules. This includes discussions about industrial policy and future technologies. We have to take a very sober look: Today\u2019s competition law is geared to the current situation \u2014 but how can it take into account the competitive situation that is developing around us?\" she said in the interview, which took place at the EPP's Brussels headquarters.\n\nAsked if the next European Commission, which will take office later this year, should address the issue, Kramp-Karrenbauer replied: \"In my view, yes. I believe that we must attach greater importance to the issue of industrial policy in Europe.\"\n\nChinese challenge\n\nThe CDU leader's comments reflected a frequent complaint from European business leaders that they do not compete with China on a level playing field, with Beijing exercising tight control over foreign investments and giving major state backing to its own firms.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer said her stance is not born out of fear of China. \"We accept competition. But this competition must be fair, it must respect the rules. And competition is also about size [of companies],\" she said.\n\nAsked how Europe could compete better with China, she said: \"We need to be at the forefront of technological development again. We have a time-critical window on AI, and there is an opportunity there, especially in terms of application orientation. But we will only get this off the ground with sufficient momentum if we do it on a pan-European basis.\"\n\nAs the new CDU leader, Kramp-Karrenbauer takes up a prominent place in the EPP family of center-right parties. Its leaders have come under fire from opponents and rights activists for keeping the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n in its ranks, despite its strong anti-migrant rhetoric and policies, attacks on EU institutions and crackdown on academic freedom. The European Parliament last year launched disciplinary proceedings against Budapest on the basis that the EU's core values are at risk.\n\nAsked if Orb\u00e1n could be part of the constructive pro-European majority she hopes will form after the European Parliament election, Kramp-Karrenbauer said the issue presents \"a very difficult situation for the EPP.\"\n\n\"The strength of Europe at the end of the day has always been that we stuck together and that demands a great amount \u2014 probably even more so than in the past \u2014 of discussions, of balancing, of bringing along individual countries\" \u2014 Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\n\n\"There are elements of Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s policies that very much bind us together \u2014 for example the concept of the social market economy, of economic policy,\" she said. \"But there are positions of Fidesz, or Viktor Orb\u00e1n, on issues such as rule of law and academic independence on which, rightly in my view, the relevant procedure has been launched by the European Union.\"\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer added: \"As long as Fidesz remains a part of the EPP, however difficult that may be, there is a chance to argue over these positions in a dialogue. And we would deprive ourselves of this opportunity if we were to separate.\"\n\nShe said the Greens could be part of a pro-EU alliance in the Parliament but described some of their policies as \"very difficult, in terms of the balance between economy and ecology.\"\n\nManfred's the man\n\nThe CDU leader also offered strong support for the Spitzenkandidat system, under which pan-European parties select a lead candidate in the election who is also their pick for European Commission president. Many EU leaders dislike the system, arguing they should have a free hand in nominating a Commission chief for approval by the Parliament.\n\nThe system was used for the first time in the last European Parliament election, resulting in Jean-Claude Juncker becoming Commission president. If it is used again this time, EPP Spitzenkandidat Manfred Weber \u2014 from the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union \u2014 would be in pole position as the center-right alliance is widely predicted to come first in the election.\n\n\"We followed the Spitzenkandidat concept last time round, and so it would be a step backwards to say that the second time we deviate from the concept,\" Kramp-Karrenbauer said. \"We have established that, and it is the position that I represent as CDU chair and, of course, all the more so because it's Manfred Weber, whom I wholeheartedly support.\"\n\nOn European integration and the Franco-German cooperation that has been at the heart of the project, Kramp-Karrenbauer signaled continuity with Merkel's middle-ground approach of edging cautiously forward rather than making great leaps. She said she supports the concept of a European army but envisages it as national militaries working together rather than being replaced.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer, whose home region borders France, also sought to reassure other EU members that greater Franco-German cooperation is not a threat to the bloc as a whole.\n\n\"The strength of Europe at the end of the day has always been that we stuck together and that demands a great amount \u2014 probably even more so than in the past \u2014 of discussions, of balancing, of bringing along individual countries,\" she said. \"And for that it\u2019s important that there is a well-functioning [Franco-German] axis \u2013 but it\u2019s just as important to make clear it\u2019s not exclusive.\"\n\nDespite her recent rise to CDU leader, Kramp-Karrenbauer she said she plans to hold on to at least one tradition from her old life. She will continue to take to the stage in her home region at carnival time in the character of a cleaning woman in the state parliament, to poke fun at politicians. Her only challenge is selecting her material. \"So much is happening that I am still collecting ideas,\" she said.\n\nRead this next: 5 fights between France and Italy"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-industrial-plan-signals-europes-protectionist-lurch/", "text": "Europe's increasingly protectionist economic trajectory after Brexit is becoming clearer by the day.\n\nGermany will this week launch a new industrial strategy that will align it more closely with France in its desire to protect national champions against threats from China and the U.S.\n\nEconomy Minister Peter Altmaier will unveil the strategy on Tuesday to grant special support to sectors such as batteries for electric cars, chemicals and 3D printing, two industry sources and one official said. The German newspaper Die Welt reported Thursday that the strategic industries for protection in Altmaier's paper would also include cars, machine engineering, medical devices, green technologies, aerospace and defense.\n\nAltmaier's plan comes hard on the heels of proposals from the BDI, Germany's biggest industrial group, to take a more defensive line against China and allow companies to bulk up into European champions that can take on Asian rivals, even if that means rewriting the EU's hallowed competition rulebook.\n\nThe debate over national champions has taken center stage politically because Paris and Berlin are frustrated that the European Commission's antitrust regulators are set to block a landmark merger between France's Alstom and Germany's Siemens in the rail sector.\n\n\"We have allowed too many mergers, so it is wrong to change the rules to allow for even larger mergers\" \u2014 Lars Feld, German economist\n\nBrussels argues that a combined Franco-German train behemoth would harm consumers and smaller businesses in the same sector, but the free marketeers at the Commission are looking increasingly isolated. Freed from British economic liberalism in the EU, French and German policymakers are increasingly looking to tear up the EU's competition and merger rules to cosset their biggest businesses.\n\nOnly last Thursday, Altmaier told parliamentarians in the Bundestag that the EU should allow the creation of \"European champions\" that can compete with China and the U.S. \"That is why we must ... consider what adjustments are necessary in our competition law,\" he said. His French counterpart Bruno Le Maire has also called for new EU competition rules to smoothe the creation of champions.\n\nThe German economy ministry explicitly named certain companies as important, including BASF, Thyssenkrupp, Siemens and Deutsche Bank, which will raise eyebrows in Brussels, particularly if Germany intends to allow these companies to bend EU merger rules.\n\nManfred Weber, the German conservative among the favorites to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as Commission president, has also slammed the Commission's move to block the Alstom-Siemens merger as a \"major mistake\" and raised the prospect of changing EU competition laws.\n\nApr\u00e8s nous le dirigisme\n\nCritics warn that without the counterweight of Britain, France and Germany are likely to push the EU toward more dirigiste economic policies that could harm consumers by creating inefficient monopolies.\n\nGerman economists are alarmed. Lars Feld, a member of the country's national council of economic experts (informally described as Germany's \"wise men\"), said the plan is akin to calling for a \"centrally planned economy.\"\n\n\"We used to be worried that if Britain left the EU, Germany would be more isolated in defending liberalism against anti-market policies. But now it looks like Germany is going to be the driver of such free-market hostility.\"\n\nAccording to the ministry, the paper will be named \"Industrial Strategy 2030\" \u2014 an echo of Beijing's \"Made in China 2025.\"\n\n\"Minister Altmaier will present measures to secure the economic and technological leadership of Germany and the European Union with the industrial strategy,\" a spokesperson for the economy ministry said.\n\nThe plan is already being hotly debated in Germany. Economists decried the strategy as a dangerous sign that Germany is promoting state intervention. Feld said he fears the plan is a \u201cradical upheaval of German economic policy\u201d and said the call for European champions is an \u201cattack on EU competition policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cResearchers have found over the past years that merger control was too lax. We have allowed too many mergers, so it is wrong to change the rules to allow for even larger mergers,\" he said.\n\nIsabel Schnabel, another member of the council of economic experts, said that instead of subsidizing companies, Germany should spend the money on research and education. \"Dear Peter Altmaier, if we have so much money to spend \u2014 why not ... create three to five German Berkeleys instead of pouring money into national champions?\" she said on Twitter.\n\nA shot of pragmatism\n\nTraditionally, it's been the left in Germany that was friendlier toward state intervention. But the plan by Altmaier, a center-right politician, signals a broader shift in Germany toward industrial planning.\n\nCommentators from industry and Altmaier\u2019s own Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party see the strategy as a welcome dose of pragmatism. Faced with aggressive strategies in China and the U.S. to attract manufacturing and high-value technologies, Germany can no longer afford to play laissez faire and needs to identify the sectors that it wishes to maintain in Europe, the argument goes.\n\nStefan Rouenhoff, a lawmaker from the CDU and member of the Bundestag\u2019s committee for economic affairs and energy, welcomed the minister\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a competition of economic systems. This is about asserting Germany and Europe in the face of competition from the economic behemoths China and the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth in technological development and in digitization, we are facing incredible leaps that will massively change our economic and social lives.\u201d\n\nThe risk of mega companies is that they become cumbersome behemoths that under-invest and overcharge consumers.\n\nRouenhoff said he has not seen Altmaier\u2019s paper yet, but mentioned what he considers to be important: \u201cPoints of an industrial strategy should above all include the promotion of innovation and research and the promotion of digitization in our country, for which a good digital infrastructure is indispensable. Ultimately, however, we also need new approaches to competition and tax policy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Die Welt, the paper names several measures to help strategic sectors, ranging from calls for a competitive tax system and affordable energy to subsidies for the development of new key technologies.\n\nBut the paper also endorses much more controversial measures, particularly a call for mega-mergers along the lines of Alstom-Siemens. In the eyes of their proponents, such mergers would allow EU companies to punch in China\u2019s weight class. But the free-market critics say the risk of mega companies is that they become cumbersome Leviathans that under-invest and overcharge customers.\n\nHans von der Burchard contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.

The ceremony, in the historic coronation hall of the west German city, took place exactly 56 years after the signature of the Elys\u00e9e treaty, a highly symbolic post-war accord aimed at burying centuries of enmity between the two countries.\n\n\"At a moment where our Europe is threatened by the nationalist movements emerging inside its borders, shaken by a painful Brexit and worried by global concerns that go beyond nations \u2014 the climate, digital technology, terrorism or migration \u2014 Germany and France have to take responsibility and show the way,\" Macron said before the signing ceremony.\n\nAachen was not chosen as the venue by chance. The city, known to French speakers as Aix-la-Chapelle, was the capital of the Franconian King Charlemagne, sometimes called the \"father of Europe,\" whose empire stretched over large parts of what later became the European Union's six founding countries, including France and Germany.\n\nThe new treaty is more cautious than ambitious \u2014 long on aspirations and short on concrete commitments to make major changes. But talk of revving up the engine that has been at the center of the European project makes some other members of the EU nervous: They fear it could exclude them from decision-making as Berlin and Paris become ever more dominant inside the bloc after Brexit.\n\n\u201cA Franco-German axis that goes around other Member States to stitch up EU business is exactly what we feared when the U.K. announced their intention to leave\" \u2014 Czech MEP Jan Zahradil\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk gave voice to those fears with a candid warning to Macron and Merkel at the ceremony.\n\n\"Let me put it very bluntly: Today Europe needs a clear signal from Paris and Berlin that enhanced cooperation in smaller formats is not an alternative to the cooperation of Europe as a whole,\" he said.\n\n\"To the east of Germany there are hundreds of places where the European spirit of a place \u2014 genius loci \u2014 is felt as strongly as in Aachen, Paris or Berlin, and where millions of people live whose hearts beat for Europe, a Europe of mutually supportive and equal nations,\" said Tusk, who spoke in Polish just to make sure no one missed his point.\n\nEuroskeptic Czech MEP Jan Zahradil was even more outspoken. \u201cA Franco-German axis that goes around other Member States to stitch up EU business is exactly what we feared when the U.K. announced their intention to leave,\" he said in an emailed statement.\n\nAccording to Zahradil, the Aachen treaty demonstrates why the EU should not deviate from the principle of unanimity in Council decisions on foreign policy: \"No other member state is going to feel comfortable giving up their veto if it's just for Paris and Berlin to take the reins.\"\n\nIn Aachen, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker argued that critics of Franco-German cooperation should be careful what they wish for.\n\n\"For many years I have seen that these common ideas, this platform that you two countries share, may well cause irritation with others. They say, 'oh, that's a bit much.' You're kind of too much of a good thing,\" he said. \"But it would be very painful as soon as Germany and France were not of one and the same position. So we should stick to this common position because that means that the others can also forge a position together.\"\n\nElys\u00e9e echoes\n\nJust like the 1963 Elys\u00e9e accord, the new treaty avoids naming precise commitments and goals in most areas, and in many ways demonstrates how little Macron has won from Berlin on Europe.\n\nThe document says that Germany and France will \"deepen their cooperation on foreign policy, defense, external and internal security and development issues, while strengthening Europe's capacity to act independently.\" However, the commitments to close coordination at European and international level are largely a reflection of what's already common practice between Paris and Berlin.\n\nBoth countries promise to defend each other in the event of an attack \u2014 something they are already committed to as NATO members. They vow to accelerate the consolidation of the defense sector in order to \"further develop Europe's military performance, coherence and credibility.\"\n\n\"Those who forget the value of French-German reconciliation are making themselves accomplices of the crimes of the past\" \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron\n\nElsewhere, France commits to lobby to get Germany a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council and the two countries agree to more regular high-level meetings of the German-French security council, and to \"develop a common approach for arms export.\"\n\nHow difficult the latter issue will be was just recently demonstrated by the Franco-German discord over arms exports to Saudi Arabia: Merkel blocked them after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Macron did not.\n\nPressed on that example during a one-hour dialogue with German and French citizens following the treaty signing, Merkel admitted difficulties: \"We thought a great deal about that, as that's about the question of how autonomous a country wants to be,\" she said. However, she insisted on the need for a common position on the development and export of arms: \"We are running around the world selling two airplanes, the Eurofighter and the Rafale. That doesn't make sense,\u201d Merkel said, adding: \u201cWe can't lock horns over every screw\u201d that gets exported.\n\nA Europe that protects\n\nProbably the most tangible outcomes of the treaty relate to cross-border cooperation, transport and trade: Both sides want to create \"a Franco-German economic area\" that cuts bureaucratic hurdles and establishes common regulations, laws and taxes for business on both sides of the Rhine.\n\nHowever, Merkel cautioned this is a long-term project. \"Take, for example, business taxes or insolvency law \u2014 much is historically structured in very different ways,\" the chancellor said during the discussion. \"We won't change that overnight, it will take two decades.\"\n\nMacron stressed the importance of such projects to make the benefits of European integration better visible to citizens and to deliver \"a Europe that really protects,\" echoing a slogan that has become his catchphrase.\n\nThe French president, who is facing fierce opposition at home from the Yellow Jackets movement \u2014 about 100 of them gathered outside the Aachen town hall to barrack him with howling and whistling \u2014 also hit back at opponents of the treaty such as National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, who has accused Macron of handing the Alsace and Lorraine border regions back to German tutelage.\n\n\"Those who forget the value of French-German reconciliation are making themselves accomplices of the crimes of the past,\" Macron said. \"Those who ... spread lies are hurting the same people they are pretending to defend by seeking to repeat our history.\"\n\nRead this next: Mercron's sound and fury"}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/3-uk-conservative-mps-resign-from-party/", "text": "Conservative MP Heidi Allen | Leon Neal/Getty Images 3 UK Conservative MPs resign from party The trio have been critical of Theresa May\u2019s strategy on Brexit.\n\nLONDON \u2014 Three Conservative MPs resigned from their party to join The Independent Group of eight Labour MPs who earlier this week formed a breakaway centrist faction in parliament.\n\nThe three MPs \u2014 Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry \u2014 have been highly critical of Prime Minister Theresa May's strategy on Brexit and have voted against the government on that issue.\n\nIn a joint letter to the prime minister they accuse May of a \"shift to the right\" and of being \"firmly in the grip\" of the Brexiteer group of backbenchers, the European Research Group, and the Democratic Unionist Party.\n\n\u201cInstead of seeking to heal the divisions or to tackle the underlying causes of Brexit, the priority was to draw up \u2018red lines,\u2019\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe 48% [who voted Remain in the referendum] were not only sidelined, they were alienated.\"\n\nThe move adds momentum to The Independent Group which hitherto had been made up of former Labour MPs disillusioned by their own party's leadership on Brexit, anti-Semitism and foreign policy. With the U.K.'s imminent departure from the EU causing fault lines through both major parties, there have been rumors for months about splits and breakaways. As yet, the new group is not a party and does not have a leader or specific policies, although all the MPs who have joined so far support a second referendum on Brexit.\n\nAt a press conference in Westminster, Allen referred to the trio as \"the three amigos,\" adding that she was \"tired of feeling numb,\" and of \"nodding through policy and voting like sheep.\"\n\n\"I want to be part of something better: a party that people vote for because they want to not not because they feel they have to,\" she said. \"I feel liberated.\"\n\n\"We might fail, but isn\u2019t the prize worth fighting for?\" she asked, \"I for one am prepared to give it everything I\u2019ve got.\"\n\nSoubry said that what she called \"traditional, one nation Tories\" like her had been fighting the right-wing of the party from within, but that was now lost. \u201cThe truth is the battle is over and the other side has won,\" she said, \"The right wing, the hard-line anti EU awkward squad that have destroyed every leader for the last 40 years are now running the Conservative Party from top to toe.

We believe there is a failure of politics in general, not just in the Conservative party but in both main parties as they move to the fringes, leaving millions of people with no representation. Our politics needs urgent and radical reform and we are determined to play our part.\u201d\n\nMay issued a statement saying she is \"saddened\" by the decision of the three MPs. \u201cOf course, the UK\u2019s membership of the EU has been a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time.

The EMA is expecting to pay around \u20ac13.6 million a year in rent for that site from 2020.\n\nSteikunas said continuing to service its London lease until 2039 would \u201cnecessarily and fundamentally impact upon the EMA\u2019s institutional effectiveness,\u201d and that the costs are in the region of 15 percent of its staff budget \u2014 making the charge \u201cakin to requiring the EMA to do without a substantial proportion of its current workforce.\u201d The regulator, which is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of medicines for sale across the EU, has already been forced to delay or scale back a range of activities during the relocation.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Marcus Smith suggested the EMA should have thought of that before deciding to relocate.\n\nThe judge determined that the EMA could have stayed in the U.K. \u2014 saying the \u201cmove from London to Amsterdam was not required as a matter of law.\u201d Following the U.K.\u2019s Brexit referendum, the EU institutions were clear that an EU agency could not remain in a non-member country, and the European Council initiated a bidding process to determine the new location.\n\nBoth the EMA and the EU must have considered the \u201cadditional cost\u201d of that relocation and the financial implications of building a new facility, Smith wrote. \u201cIf they have not, then they should have done,\u201d he added.\n\nAn EMA spokesperson said, \u201cthe Agency had no say and was not a party in the political and legislative process leading to the approval of Amsterdam as its new seat.\u201d\n\nStating that the \u201cEMA has a legal personality distinct from the EU institutions,\u201d the agency said that, under the regulation adopted by the Council and European Parliament \u201cwho are not parties to the lease agreement, EMA has no choice but to leave London and move to Amsterdam on or before 30 March 2019.\u201d\n\nThe EMA\u2019s own former head of counsel noted shortly after the referendum that there is no law against keeping the drugs agency in the U.K.\n\nA costly mistake\n\nAfter entering into an agreement to begin construction on the custom London headquarters in 2011, the agency in 2014 began a 25-year \u00a3500 million lease that was negotiated without a break clause to make it cheaper.\n\n\u201cThe EMA chose to enter into a long-term relationship, with long-term obligations,\u201d Smith observed in his judgment. \u201cIt could have opted for different premises, with a shorter lease; it could have negotiated a break and paid a (far) higher price and foregone the inducements it received. It did none of these things,\u201d he said.\n\nProperty lawyers in London were also watching the case closely since they said it would set strong precedent for other efforts to break contract leases.\n\nThe ruling has implications for the next EU budget, running from 2021 to 2027, which is being negotiated in Brussels. With the U.K.\u2019s departure set to leave a hole of up to \u20ac13 billion a year in the budget, countries are highly sensitive to how the money will be allocated.\n\nProperty lawyers in London were also watching the case closely since they said it would set strong precedent for other efforts to break contract leases. The EMA\u2019s legal argument hinged on an arcane doctrine in English contract law known as \u201cfrustration,\u201d stemming from a 1903 decision (Krell v. Henry) established after a man rented a room to watch King Edward VII\u2019s coronation procession but then saw the procession canceled after the king got appendicitis.\n\n\u201cWe fulfill our contracts and expect other parties with whom we enter contracts to respect the law and their own obligations, particularly in the case where a party is created and backed by an international institution,\u201d Sir George Iacobescu, chairman and CEO of the Canary Wharf Group, said of the court\u2019s decision to throw out the EMA\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cThe high bar for frustration claims applies to all contracts, not just leases, and parties looking for an \u2018out\u2019 due to Brexit would need to formulate their claims very carefully to have a chance at success,\u201d said Frances Richardson, head of real estate disputes at Linklaters, in a statement.\n\nThe EMA now needs to decide whether to appeal or find a subletter, which will be subject to its landlord\u2019s approval. There will be a final hearing in the case before March 29 to determine who will pay the legal costs.\n\n\u201cThe Agency continues to trust in the cooperation and goodwill of the Canary Wharf Group to find a mutually satisfactory solution before the end of March 2019,\u201d the EMA spokesperson said.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.

There, next to a darkened conference room, engineers sit at dark gray monitors, waging war with lines of code.\n\n\u201cAttacks are happening every day,\u201d says Oleh Derevianko, founder of the Ukrainian cybersecurity firm that employs them, Information Systems Security Partners. \"We never thought we were going to be the front line of cyber and hybrid war.\"\n\nThere may be no better place to witness cyber conflict in action than Ukraine today. Open warfare with Russia, a highly skilled, computer-literate pool of talent and a uniquely vulnerable political, economic and IT environment have made the country the perfect sandbox for those looking to test new cyberweapons, tactics and tools.\n\n\"Ukraine is live-fire space,\" says Kenneth Geers, a veteran cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who advises NATO's Tallinn cyber center and spent time on the ground in Ukraine to study the country\u2019s cyber conflict. Much like global powers fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the Cold War, Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms race for global influence.\n\nDerevianko's outfit works closely with the Ukrainian government and its U.S. and European allies to fend off onslaughts against the country\u2019s networks. On the other side of the virtual front line: Not just sophisticated Russian-affiliated hacker groups like Fancy Bear, Cozy Bear and Sandworm \u2014 the group behind \u201cNotPetya,\u201d the most devastating cyberattack to date \u2014 but also hosts of other governmental, nongovernmental and criminal players testing out their capabilities on the country\u2019s networks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not only testing destruction but also testing your reflexes\" \u2014 Oleh Derevianko, founder of Information Systems Security Partners\n\nActivity has spiked ahead of presidential elections in March, says Derevianko. Since November, hacker groups have been shelling Ukrainian magistrates, government officials, attorneys and others with emails that contain attachments with malware and viruses \u2014 sometimes disguised as Christmas greetings, or as messages from the prime minister\u2019s office \u2014 in what Derevianko describes as \u201cmass phishing.\u201d\n\nRussian hacker groups are repeatedly attempting to get into the country\u2019s systems, Ukraine\u2019s national security service told POLITICO. Critical infrastructure and election systems are under constant stress, it said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not only testing destruction but also testing your reflexes,\u201d says Derevianko.\n\nRussia's playground\n\nThe war in eastern Ukraine has given Russian-affiliated hackers the opportunity to perfect their ability to launch cyberattacks with a series of major intrusions in Ukraine over the past few years.\n\n\u201cThe annexation of Crimea and war in Donbas, it has created a volatile political environment,\" says Merle Maigre, the former head of NATO\u2019s cyberdefense center in Tallinn who is now executive vice president at the Estonian cybersecurity firm CybExer.\n\nEven as Russian tanks crossed the physical border into eastern Ukraine in the spring of 2014, Russian-affiliated hackers were sending malicious code onto Ukraine\u2019s IT systems, providing political chaos as a smokescreen.\n\nThree days before the presidential election in May 2014, hackers broke into Ukraine\u2019s Central Election Commission and disabled parts of the network using advanced cyberespionage malware, according to a report by the International Foundation of Electoral Systems funded by the U.S. and U.K. and seen by POLITICO. The Central Election Commission was hit again later that year, when hackers took down its website ahead of a parliamentary vote in October.\n\nLarge-scale attacks followed the next year, and again in 2016. The targets, this time, were companies running Ukraine\u2019s power grid. In 2015, hackers used so-called BlackEnergy malware, dropped on companies\u2019 networks using spear phishing attacks that tricked employees into downloading from mock emails. So-called KillDisk malware later destroyed parts of the grid.\n\nThe resulting blackouts \u2014 the world\u2019s first known successful cyberattack on an energy company at scale \u2014 affected about 230,000 Ukrainians for up to six hours. A year later, in December 2016, hackers relied on even more sophisticated tools to successfully turn off the lights in large parts of the Ukrainian capital yet again.\n\nBut the widest-reaching attack \u2014 and the world\u2019s most financially damaging to date \u2014 took place in 2017, when hackers combined code tested in the power grid attacks with malware known as \u201cPetya\u201d and a security vulnerability initially discovered by the U.S. National Security Agency called EternalBlue.\n\nThe resulting malware \u2014 \"NotPetya\u201d \u2014 compromised the software of a small tech firm called Linkos Group, providing it access to the computers of utility companies, banks, airports and government agencies in Ukraine. It also crippled multinationals like the Danish shipping giant Maersk, logistics giant FedEx, pharma company Merck and other major corporations.\n\nThe NotPetya attack \u2014 which cost an estimated $10 billion to clean up \u2014 was \u201cas close to cyberwar\u201d as we\u2019ve come, says Geers. \u201cThis was the most damaging attack in history, of a scale and cost that would far exceed a missile fired from the Donbas into Kiev.\"\n\nCyber sandbox\n\nThe free-for-all environment of a country at war has turned Ukraine into a magnet for players of all types looking to test their cyber capabilities. In addition to hostile Russian hackers, the country has attracted cybersecurity firms looking to get close to the action, Western intelligence agencies seeking to understand the nature of modern conflict and criminals looking to make a buck.\n\n\u201cDonbas is basically lit up with malware. That\u2019s intelligence services trying to figure out what Russia is going to do next in Donbas, trying to figure out what [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is up to,\u201d says Geers, the Atlantic Council\u2019s cybersecurity expert. \u201cThe U.S., China, Russia, Israel, Turkey, Iran \u2014 it\u2019s coming from everywhere.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the ongoing military conflict, Ukraine offers a tempting target because so many of the country\u2019s computers run pirated software, which doesn\u2019t receive standard security patches. And, because it is well integrated with Western European internet networks, the country offers a backdoor to hack the rest of Europe.\n\nConstant attempted attacks by hacker groups such as Fancy Bear, Cozy Bear and Turla are putting critical infrastructure and election systems under constant stress, Ukraine\u2019s national security told POLITICO.\n\nThe goal, say experts, is to test the West\u2019s defenses. The U.S. and other intelligence agencies have responded by moving into the Ukrainian networks to pick up the signals.\n\n\u201cGetting intelligence ahead of time is important,\u201d says Dymtro Shymkiv, the former head of Microsoft in Ukraine and President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s chief adviser on cyber between 2014 and 2018. \u201cSome of the viruses and malware in the energy blackouts in Ukraine were later found in the U.S. and Israel.\u201d\n\nUkrainian authorities, he says, exchange cyber intel for help in fending off the hackers.\n\n\u201cWhenever we identified malware, we uploaded it to special services where manufacturers of anti-virus could analyze it,\u201d says Shymkiv. His cyber team sometimes worked with expert communities on platforms like Hybrid Analysis or ANY.RUN, a technique known as \u201ccloud-based sandboxing,\u201d where researchers can access the data and get in touch with those affected by malware, he says.\n\n\"U.S. counterparts, they are requesting a lot of information and interacting very productively\" \u2014 Roman Boyarchuk, head of Ukraine\u2019s State Cyber Protection Center\n\nWashington has invested heavily in cyber resilience in Ukraine since 2014. USAID alone freed up a pot of $10 million (\u20ac8.9 million) for cybersecurity defenses, and a sizeable part of its much larger budget to support Ukraine goes to securing IT systems in the country.\n\nU.S. companies, such as tech giant Microsoft, have also beefed up their presence in the country. Hardware leader Cisco has a strong foothold that includes its renowned cyberintelligence unit Talos. And U.S. cyber firm CrowdStrike, known for bullishly calling out state-sponsored hacks, is also active in the country, as are many others.\n\nThe U.S. and Europe are also investing in seminars and training for Ukrainian cybersecurity staff, and are involved in day-to-day assistance via the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), an international organization backed by democracies worldwide to help out with holding elections, and other channels.\n\n\"U.S. counterparts, they are requesting a lot of information and interacting very productively,\" says Roman Boyarchuk, the head of Ukraine\u2019s State Cyber Protection Center, the authority tasked with fending off attackers from government networks. American and European cybersecurity authorities regularly ask for more details about his agency\u2019s analysis of major threats, he says.\n\nActivity has increased ahead of Ukraine\u2019s national election in March, experts say, as smaller groups and individual hackers and criminals look for financial gain.\n\n\"They're scanning the networks and sending a lot of malware in order to find the breaches, the vulnerabilities,\u201d says Boyarchuck, of the national cyber emergency team. \u201cThey are taking control, recording this control, putting it into databases and selling it.\u201d\n\nThe hackers then find buyers for these credentials or access into confidential networks. Large data sets are sold on dark web marketplaces to anyone willing to pay the price.\n\n\"Everyone is buying it,\" says Boyarchuk. \"Corporate competitors, state actors, anybody.\"\n\nFears of contagion\n\nFor Kiev\u2019s cyber helpers, the goal is not just to help out a developing country under pressure. As Ukraine becomes ever more integrated with the West, there\u2019s a strong fear of contagion. A successful cyberattack in Kiev, they fear, can easily slip the country\u2019s borders and infect computers across the globe.\n\nThat\u2019s become especially true following Ukraine's shift toward the West, which triggered Russia\u2019s aggression. The country\u2019s 2014 Association Agreement with the EU came with a \"deep and comprehensive free-trade agreement\" in place since 2016 that has strengthened economic ties. And with the increase in trade has come added data flows and interactions in its internet networks.\n\nThe 2017 \u201cNotPetya\u201d attack was a painful example of the risks that come with this kind of entanglement: An attack starting in a small tech firm in Ukraine spread to companies and government agencies across the world, grinding the business of international heavy-hitters to a halt.\n\n\"We provided them with political support, we've supported Ukraine in providing guns and ammo. Now we're moving to cyber\" \u2014 Edvinas Kerza, Lithuania's vice minister of national defense\n\nNotPetya \"was when everybody realized how vulnerable we are when Ukraine gets hit,\" says Maigre, the former head of NATO\u2019s cyberdefense center. \"It easily blows over to Europe and beyond.\"\n\nFor the EU, in particular, the attack underlined the urgency of beefing up Ukraine\u2019s cyberdefenses.\n\nSince then, European countries have set up bilateral assistance deals. Estonia, for example, is heavily involved in helping Ukrainian authorities set up a secure electoral IT system. Lithuania is also active, according to Edvinas Kerza, the country's vice minister of national defense.\n\n\"We provided them with political support, we've supported Ukraine in providing guns and ammo,\" says Kerza. \"Now we're moving to cyber.\"\n\nThe EU's eye is now on securing the upcoming presidential election at the end of March.\n\n\u201cWe strongly expect Russia will try to influence the course of Ukraine\u2019s presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s security service said in an email, adding that the greatest threat comes from special services launching \u201cpurposeful, long-term cyberattacks with state interests in mind.\u201d\n\nAbove all, the March vote could provide valuable insight for the EU, as it braces for cyberattacks on its European election at the end of May. That vote \u2014 in which voters in 27 countries will choose a new European Parliament and by extension decide who sits at the helm of the EU\u2019s top institutions \u2014 is uniquely vulnerable to interference.\n\nWhat happens in Kiev today could easily happen in Berlin, Rome or Amsterdam tomorrow, experts say. Ukraine \"is sort of like a litmus test,\" says Maigre. The stream of phishing emails, the data sold on the dark web, the new types of malware \u2014 all of it can pop up west of Ukraine at any time. \"That's why it is interesting to see how it all plays out in the elections,\" she says."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/the-day-project-fear-got-real/", "text": "The number of companies quitting Britain or slashing jobs can\u2019t be attributed to bad luck any more. There are just too many.\n\nJapanese carmaker Honda made a major announcement on Tuesday: It will close its plant in Swindon by 2022. That means cutting 3,500 jobs and a calamitous knock-on effect on all the smaller companies that supply and service Honda in southern England.\n\nThis is only the latest instalment of a snowballing disinvestment, which was never in the Brexiteers\u2019 script. From the beginning of the Brexit battle, leading Conservatives always insisted that Remainers were stoking \u201cProject Fear\u201d by arguing that major companies would quit Britain if the U.K. left the single market.\n\nBut a trickle of departing businesses is now becoming a stream. Prime Minister Theresa May is gambling that she can win a game of high-stakes political brinkmanship with the EU, but the U.K.'s reputation as a safe destination for foreign direct investment has already taken a heavy knock.\n\nThe Dutch government this month gloated that it had helped 42 companies make the switch from the U.K. to the Netherlands in 2018 because of Brexit and is in talks with more than 250 others about making a move.\n\nBritain must now contend with an unprecedented number of companies saying that they are packing their bags or warning that they will do so.\n\nThe Tories claim that the Honda announcement has nothing to do with Brexit. Justin Tomlinson, Conservative lawmaker for North Swindon, argued that the closure is all about \u201cglobal trends and not Brexit.\u201d Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also suggested there is \"economic uncertainty that's not related to Brexit.\"\n\nBut these arguments are not holding water with the opposition. Tom Brake, from the Liberal Democrats, said the announcement \u201cis a shocking blow to the government's delusional belief that Brexit won't destroy British industries.\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also blamed the government's \"disastrous handling of Brexit.\"\n\nWhile Tory MPs said that Honda's decision to consolidate production in Japan is unrelated to Brexit, Japan has secured a landmark trade deal with the EU to slash tariffs on goods. Honda can be confident of being able to export to the EU, while Britain could face higher barriers for access to the EU market.\n\nBritain must now contend with an unprecedented number of companies saying that they are packing their bags or warning that they will do so. POLITICO takes a look back at the past few weeks of bad news for Brexit Britain.\n\nHonda\u2019s exit: The long lead time on Honda\u2019s closure reflects the industry\u2019s cyclical investment pattern. Around 100,000 Civics are produced at the Swindon site and though the suggestion is that Honda will maintain a European headquarters in England, the closure notice raises the question of how government officials will deal with mass layoffs. Local MP Tomlinson tweeted that the government would set up a task force to manage unemployment.\n\nNissan\u2019s U-turn: Nissan decided not to produce a new SUV model at its plant in Sunderland \u2014 the first English city to declare it wanted out of the EU on referendum night. Nissan opted to play it safe and build the new vehicle back home in Japan. The company employs 7,000 at the factory complex and had been given government assurances (and a commitment of \u00a380 million in cash) to keep things ticking over at the Sunderland plant.\n\nAirbus\u2019 warnings: Airbus, which employs 14,000 people in Britain, has been sharpening the tone of its warnings as Brexit approaches. On Sunday, the company\u2019s chief in Britain Katherine Bennett warned that a no-deal Brexit would be \"catastrophic\" for the industry, adding that \u201cthere is no such thing as a managed \u2018no deal\u2019\u201d for producers.\n\n\u201cSome difficult decisions will have to be made if there\u2019s no deal ... We will have to look at future investments,\" she said. \"There's many other countries that dearly love aerospace.\"\n\nFord\u2019s retreat: Company officials had already told POLITICO the EU\u2019s latest car and van carbon dioxide emission targets up to 2030 are so ambitious that they could start looking for the exit. But in the U.K., officials warned May this month that operations would need to be relocated under a no-deal scenario. That\u2019s not good news for the 13,000 people the American auto giant employs in Britain.\n\nJaguar\u2019s rest: Jaguar Land Rover has scheduled extra maintenance down time at one of its English plants. The company employs 39,000 across the country and has already announced 4,500 layoffs as part of a massive cost saving plan. It\u2019s also committed to carrying out some production in Slovakia at a new plant.\n\nFlybmi\u2019s bellyflop: British regional airline flybmi on Sunday filed for bankruptcy, blaming Brexit and fuel costs. \"The uncertainty created by the Brexit process\" has \u201cled to our inability to secure valuable flying contracts in Europe,\" the company said.\n\nHitachi: Japanese manufacturer Hitachi announced last month that it would stop construction of a nuclear power station in Wales, only days after May\u2019s Brexit deal was defeated in parliament. The company said it had failed to find sufficient private investors. The plant was expected to provide about 6 percent of Britain's electricity.\n\nWho\u2019s also issuing warnings? Toyota owns a plant in Derby from which 90 percent of output is exported to the rest of the EU. The Japanese carmaker warned last year that production would stall under a hard Brexit. Meanwhile, BMW has multiple facilities throughout the U.K. and has flirted with shifting production of its iconic Mini to the Netherlands. It has also previously said production would stop for a month at the site in Oxford.\n\nGovernment waking up to the danger: Britain\u2019s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Monday in a POLITICO interview that a solution to Brexit is needed quickly to avoid damage.\n\n\u201cWe need to resolve this as quickly as we can,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cWe need to resolve this for the sake of industry, actually for the sake of the sanity of the population of Britain and indeed of Europe.\u201d\n\nBut still holding course toward no-deal Brexit: When asked for his plan to resolve the impasse, Hunt reiterated demands to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and called for a time limit to the Irish backstop. The EU has consistently refused reopening the deal and argued that a time limit would defeat the purpose of the backstop. Unless one side makes a big compromise, the no-deal Brexit that industry fears could take place on March 29.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.

The final text was approved by EU ambassadors last week, and it still has to be signed off by the Parliament's plenary.\n\nThe rules, which should go into effect around the end of 2020, will now require businesses to report \"suspicious\" sales of some substances within 24 hours \u2014 and the change expands them to include online sales platforms like Amazon and eBay.\n\nNew substances can be added to the list of banned substances in an effort to keep up with terrorists' innovations.\n\n\u201cThe way forward here is a mixture of public awareness that these things are not innocent materials, plus an appropriate regulation\u201d \u2014 Hans-Jakob Schindler, senior director at the Counter Extremism Project\n\n\"You\u2019re never going to be able to 100 percent prevent access,\" said Hans-Jakob Schindler, senior director at the Counter Extremism Project, an NGO. \"It\u2019s about increasing the hurdles for terrorists to get to the stuff.\"\n\nThe changes came because the EU recognized that existing rules are too porous. A 2017 European Commission appraisal found that its current regulation \u201cdoes not guarantee a sufficient level of protection of the safety of the general public.\u201d\n\nHomemade explosives were used in the \"vast majority of terrorist attacks in the EU,\" the appraisal found, including Madrid in 2004, London in 2005, Paris in 2015, Brussels in 2016, and Manchester in 2017.\n\nStriking a balance\n\nRegulating these chemicals is about striking a balance between security and legitimate access.\n\nMost of the substances listed in the EU\u2019s regulation as so-called \"explosive precursors\" also have legitimate industrial uses. Ammonium nitrate, which can easily be turned into an explosive, is also an important ingredient in many fertilizers, for example.\n\nAnd hydrogen peroxide, acetone and sulfuric acid, which when combined make TATP \u2014 a deadly and volatile mixture that was used in the bombs in Manchester, Brussels and Paris \u2014 are also key ingredients in industrial bleach, nail polish and fertilizers, respectively.\n\nRight now countries can ban substances entirely, adopt registration schemes that require an ID before purchase, or impose licensing systems under which a buyer has to demonstrate a professional need before buying.\n\n\"We still have 28 rules for dealing with these,\" said Andrejs Mamikins, a Latvian MEP who is the author of the Parliament's report on updating the regulation.\n\nThat mishmash of rules is ineffective, as it's easy for terrorists to buy in other countries, and it undermines the single market by creating different regulatory regimes, the Commission found in its review of the legislation.\n\nThe overhaul gets rid of registration schemes entirely, and tightens the rules on licenses. Countries can still impose bans.\n\nIt will also increase the obligations of stores selling the chemicals. They will need a mechanism to report \"suspicious transactions\" within 24 hours \u2014 and they\u2019ll be legally liable if a transaction can be traced back to their store.\n\nSchindler said the reporting system is \u201cnot foolproof, but it does work.\u201d He cited a case in Germany where a saleswoman reported a couple\u2019s attempt to buy large quantities of hydrogen peroxide. Investigators followed up and found weapons and huge quantities of bomb-making materials in their home.\n\n\u201cThe way forward here is a mixture of public awareness that these things are not innocent materials, plus an appropriate regulation,\u201d he said.\n\n\"The guys coming from Syria and Iraq very likely have built hundreds of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] in their time there\" \u2014 Hans-Jakob Schindler, senior director at the Counter Extremism Project\n\nJulien Bouyeron, the director of European affairs for EDRA, which represents DIY stores, said shops recognize the importance of being vigilant with these chemicals. \"They know they have responsibilities because they sell products that could be used to make bombs,\" he said.\n\nThe rules are a bit different for online retailers. Other EU regulations spell out that online marketplaces aren\u2019t expected to monitor what is sold on their platforms, which made it difficult to change those standards in the chemicals legislation, said a Council official present at last week's talks.\n\nThe official said the \"appetite for adding platforms was really high,\" as it would \"help the security aspect.\" But a minority of countries argued it would place too much of a burden on online platforms.\n\nIn the end, the compromise was that online marketplaces have to put in place procedures to detect the transactions, just like economic operators. But unlike in-person stores, they can\u2019t be held liable if they don\u2019t catch suspicious transactions.\n\nGrowing danger\n\nIt's a good time to tighten the rules, Schindler said.\n\nSome Europeans who went to fight in Syria or Iraq alongside ISIS came home with battlefield bomb-making skills, which they could use to unleash attacks on European cities. Some returned under the radar, while others were arrested, but many of those are likely to soon be released from prison.\n\n\"It\u2019s difficult to restrict all possible chemicals that could be used for explosives, or worse toxic chemical vapors\" \u2014 Kenneth Suslick, professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois\n\nIn France alone, 512 people are serving time for terrorism and another 1,140 prisoners are suspected of having been radicalized in prison. Intelligence authorities said last year that the release of 40 of them in 2018 and this year is \"a major risk.\"\n\n\n\n\"The guys coming from Syria and Iraq very likely have built hundreds of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] in their time there, because that was one of the preferred methods used as an equalizer against the much-better-equipped Iraqi army,\" Schindler said.\n\nAlthough the rule change won\u2019t entirely eliminate the possibility of people getting their hands on bomb-making ingredients, it will help, according to Kenneth Suslick, a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois who has studied TATP.\n\n\"It\u2019s difficult to restrict all possible chemicals that could be used for explosives, or worse toxic chemical vapors,\" Suslick said. \"But the most obvious ones can be.\"\n\nThis article has been updated with last week's EU ambassadors' approval."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/romanias-cancer-power-couple-takes-on-corruption/", "text": "Former Romanian Health Minister Vlad Voiculescu | Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images Cancer and corruption: In Romania, it\u2019s the same fight An ex-anchor and an ex-banker created one of Romania\u2019s most prominent NGOs. Can their popularity translate into votes?\n\nThis article is part of the Global Policy Lab: Decoding Cancer.\n\nBUCHAREST \u2014 It was a modern Romanian romance: Geeky banker meets glamorous TV anchor. Together, they start a center for kids with cancer. The banker briefly gets appointed health minister, the anchor quits journalism to work on their project full time, and their mutual prominence drives a celebrity-studded, record-setting fundraising campaign. They accumulate accolades and fawning media coverage in the West.\n\nBut as part of a constellation of civil society groups filling the gaps left by a lack of government support for cancer research and care, the couple also drew the ire of politicians in Bucharest. And for Vlad Voiculescu and Melania Medeleanu \u2014 whose love affair has since ended \u2014 it also meant they became increasingly fed up with Romanian bureaucracy.\n\nFor Voiculescu, 35, that frustration has morphed into a political campaign. He now manages a slate of candidates running in the European Parliament election next May on the list of a new Romanian liberal party, PLUS. Next year, he plans to run for Bucharest mayor.\n\nThe big question is whether a fundraising and advocacy success can translate into votes on both ballots. And early trends aren't necessarily encouraging.\n\n\"I'm really worried about what's going to happen with this country if my generation doesn't ... make an effort\" \u2014 Vlad Voiculescu, former Romanian health minister\n\nRecent opinion polls show support for the PLUS party ranging from 6 to 8 percent. Voiculescu's chances in the mayoral election largely hinge on whether he can keep other challengers from splitting the opposition vote and whether he can mobilize young people to turn out to vote.\n\nBut in a country mired in corruption and engaged in a controversial bid to clean house, Voiculescu's high-profile campaign is creating powerful enemies.\n\n\"I'm really worried about what's going to happen with this country if my generation doesn't ... make an effort,\" he said. \"We all have to make an effort, even though sometimes for many of us, it would be way easier to just give up and find a nice job somewhere else in Europe.\"\n\nAnonymous actor to lightning rod\n\nVoiculescu, like millions of Romanians, left the country looking for economic opportunity. He was working in finance in Vienna when he made his first foray into activism, running cancer drugs across the border into Romania from other EU countries \u2014 a legal, \"Dallas Buyers' Club\"-style response to shortages in his homeland. What started as an anonymous quest led to headlines in 2012 and, eventually, even a HBO documentary. He later returned to Romania and started MagiCAMP, a fantastical playland for kids with cancer, with Medeleanu.\n\nIn 2016, he was appointed health minister as part of a technocratic caretaker government. His lack of political finesse was evident; his hard-charging style alienated doctors groups and hospital managers during his eight-month tenure. But his determination to cut out bribery in the health system made him a hero to many of the anti-corruption activists who took to the streets in the weeks after he left office in 2017.\n\nSince then, things have gotten worse in Romania, he said, not better.\n\n\u201cThis country is in danger of moving in a wrong direction, making life unbearable for everybody who wants to live in a free, democratic society,\u201d said Voiculescu. \u201cThis is the problem. The solution can only be political, so the solution can only be achieved through voting.\u201d\n\nRomania's ruling party \u2014 the Social Democrats \u2014 has been rocked by high turnover in its ranks and infighting sparked by accusations that Bucharest is softening its approach to fighting corruption. The government's dismissal last year of its anti-corruption prosecutor, whose office was responsible for a string of high-profile convictions of politicians, raised alarm bells in Brussels and among anti-corruption activists. The EU has since accused the country of backsliding on issues of rule of law, citing concerns about changes to its justice system and criminal code, and is worried about it embracing the kind of \"illiberal democracy\" championed by Hungarian leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nThe government is making the work of organizations like MagiCAMP harder, said Medeleanu, who is still actively involved in running the center.\n\n\u201cNGOs would not exist if the state would do its job,\u201d she said. But government officials are \"not willing and they're not capable\u201d of dealing with issues like cancer treatment, she added.\n\n\u201cThey don't care about kids with cancer, they don't care about tuberculosis ... They only care about [getting] their politicians [out of] jail,\u201d she said, referring to legislation that critics say is intended to clear a set of officials convicted of corruption.\n\nCorruption, she said, \"affects everything in Romania.\"\n\nFrom cancer to politics\n\nIn late 2017, MagiCAMP gathered more than 600 volunteers, including some of Romania's biggest celebrities, to take turns sitting in a rickety hospital chair in an art gallery window until 100,000 people committed to donate \u20ac2 a month to fund MagicHOME, an apartment building near Bucharest\u2019s main cancer hospital for families who travel long distances for treatment.\n\nThe stunt went viral, reaching an estimated 66 percent of Romanian Facebook users. By now, it has brought in more than \u20ac1 million.\n\n\"Yes, Bucharest needs something new, but [Voiculescu] has no past Bucharest history \u2014 none\" \u2014 Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, Romanian anti-corruption activist\n\nVoiculescu is clearly hoping to replicate similar visibility and enthusiasm for his political run. In some ways, it's a natural fit: Romania's young generation of social media users are an obvious constituency for Voiculescu and his political allies, as they're also the ones coming out by the hundreds of thousands to protest corruption.\n\nThe challenge, he acknowledges, is to reach beyond that group \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear how much his experience promoting MagiCAMP will help that aspect of his campaign.\n\n\"I think in both cases, what you need is people's trust and good intentions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, both of them are a sort of public service. So it's just different tools.\"\n\nCritics, however, say his motives aren\u2019t as benevolent. The current mayor of Bucharest, Gabriela Firea, last year said he is exaggerating problems in Romania\u2019s health system to raise his own profile.\n\nResponding to allegations he made last year about the poor treatment of a cystic fibrosis patient, Firea accused him of \u201cusing Romanians\u2019 health to campaign.\u201d She added, \u201cFor the sake of a political career he wishes to be very successful, but that cannot be built on lies.\u201d\n\nFirea, a member of Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party, hasn't said whether she'll run again. Voiculescu's chances of winning her current job will depend on whether he can unite opposition forces behind him. So far, that doesn't look likely.\n\n\"Yes, Bucharest needs something new, but [Voiculescu] has no past Bucharest history \u2014 none,\" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, a Romanian anti-corruption activist and professor of democracy studies at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.\n\nIn an email, she dismissed him as \"one of the wonder boys in new parties and probably the only health minister without any medical studies ever.\" (Incidentally, current Health Minister Sorina Pintea is also an economist, but she last worked as a hospital manager.)\n\nA previous anti-corruption candidate for the mayoral job \u2014 Nicu\u0219or Dan \u2014 enjoyed widespread support from civil society and yet was defeated in 2016, Mungiu-Pippidi also cautioned. She blamed liberal parties' refusal to back him \u2014 combined with an increase in older voters, who mostly support the Social Democrats in the city \u2014 for his loss.\n\n\"The ruling coalition in Romania is nowadays applying exactly the same recipe as in Hungary and in other countries\" \u2014 Vlad Voiculescu\n\nAnother point of concern for Voiculescu is the fate of the project that inspired his political ambitions in the first place.\n\n\"When you are so publicly exposed ... this draws a lot of negativity also,\" said Medeleanu, who remains a subject of fascination for Romanian tabloids. \"Vlad's political opponents, they would do anything to stop us.\"\n\nVoiculescu didn't rule out the possibility that his decision to take another shot at politics could unravel the progress he and Medeleanu made with their cancer advocacy.\n\n\"I'm very concerned for MagiCAMP, and I'm very concerned for people doing good things in this country,\" he said.\n\n\"The ruling coalition in Romania is nowadays applying exactly the same recipe as in Hungary and in other countries. First they go after the justice system ... Second they go after the media. Third, they go after everybody who has a voice.\"\n\nCarmen Paun contributed reporting and translation."}, {"source": "politico", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/blogs/the-coming-wars/2019/02/russia-china-alliance-rule-the-world/", "text": "Russia's President Vladimir Putin, left, walks with China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing | Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images The Coming Wars Russia to China: Together we can rule the world Only Europe can prevent an Eastern bloc.\n\nEurope\u2019s obsession with Russia is unrequited. Moscow just isn\u2019t interested in the Continent anymore.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t care about European integration, or moving toward Europe. But neither is it interested in Europe\u2019s predicted disintegration, or in pulling countries away from the West and closer to its way of thinking.\n\nIn the halls of the Kremlin these days, it\u2019s all about China \u2014 and whether or not Moscow can convince Beijing to form an alliance against the West.\n\nRussia\u2019s obsession with a potential alliance with China was already obvious at the Valdai Discussion Club, an annual gathering of Russia\u2019s biggest foreign policy minds, in 2017.\n\nAt their next meeting, late last year, the idea seemed to move from the speculative to something Russia wants to realize. And soon.\n\nRussia\u2019s view of China has shifted significantly over the past five years.\n\nEvery Russian speech \u2014 from obscure academics to Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin himself \u2014 played that note and no other. There was even a new sense of desperation in the air.\n\nAs Sergey Karaganov, a former adviser to Putin, explained to me at breakfast, now everything must be about China.\n\nRussia\u2019s view of China has shifted significantly over the past five years. Moscow has abandoned any hope that the Chinese economy is an example it might emulate. Instead, foreign policy experts now talk of how Russia can use China to further its geopolitical goals.\n\nThere was no doubt at Valdai that China knows how to do economic growth, and that Russia does not. Russia\u2019s elite \u2014 always so ready to resist any sign of Western hegemony \u2014 have no problem admitting China\u2019s economic superiority. Their acceptance reminded me of the way Britain gave way to the United States as the world\u2019s dominant economic power.\n\nSeen from Moscow, there is no resistance left to a new alliance led by China. And now that Washington has imposed tariffs on Chinese exports, Russia hopes China will finally understand that its problem is Washington, not Moscow.\n\nIn the past, the possibility of an alliance between the two countries had been hampered by China\u2019s reluctance to jeopardize its relations with the U.S. But now that it has already become a target, perhaps it will grow bolder. Every speaker at Valdai tried to push China in that direction.\n\nWhen Putin finished a fireside chat with policymakers \u2014 a set-piece of the conference, where he fields softball questions from the audience \u2014 he made a gesture to leave the room, but then quickly rushed back to grab Yang Jiechi, a former Chinese foreign minister and arguably the main architect of the country\u2019s foreign policy. He insisted on walking out with Yang by his side, to the obvious delight of his Chinese guest.\n\nBut what happens now? Can Russia and China really be friends, and for how long?\n\nThe thing to remember is that both countries are obsessed with overturning the American-led global order. They may have a long history of geopolitical rivalry \u2014 one that is sure to return once their goal is achieved and new poles emerge, pitting them against each other.\n\nBut they\u2019ll cross that bridge when they get there, maybe in another 20 years or so. For now, Russia and China are essentially on the same side.\n\nFor the moment, Chinese prudence remains the great obstacle to the new alliance. And Russians know this.\n\nThis alliance, if it becomes concrete, would overturn how we do global politics. Imagine an international crisis in which Russia and China suddenly emerge as a single bloc. The impact would be considerable, and to some extent unpredictable: Psychologically, in the mind of the West, it would combine the fear associated with Russia with the apparent invulnerability of China. Washington would feel under attack; Europe, intimidated and unsettled.\n\nThe old Continent would also face the threat of a split between Western Europe and the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, which could turn their focus east under the influence of a cash-happy China ready to invest in the region.\n\nIt would be an entirely new world, and it\u2019s one that is coming closer to becoming reality.\n\nFor the moment, Chinese prudence remains the great obstacle to the new alliance. And Russians know this.\n\nI met Karaganov again at a meeting with Chinese officials and think tankers in Beijing a few weeks ago. There, a number of Chinese participants said they doubted Russia\u2019s assertions that the world is in the midst of a new Cold War.\n\nKaraganov dedicated himself to convincing them otherwise, arguing with increasing passion that China is deluding itself if it thinks issues between Beijing and Washington can be conveniently resolved to the benefit of both sides.\n\nIf Beijing places its bets on peace and cooperation, the great Chinese adventure will come to an end, and China will have to live in the shadow of the U.S. for another generation \u2014 perhaps forever, Karaganov said. Chinese authorities, he argued, have no more than five years to make a decision.\n\nThe meeting was held under the Chatham House rule, so unfortunately, I cannot report on what the response from the Chinese side was; only Karaganov allowed me to relay his words.\n\nBut from my own separate conversations, Chinese officials appear to agree the clock is ticking. They\u2019re just not yet convinced they should choose war \u2014 even a Cold War.\n\nBut if China has a word on whether we see the creation of an Eastern bloc, so does Europe.\n\nEuropean markets and European technology are critical resources for China. More and more, Chinese authorities know what to expect from America, and they know all too well what to expect from Russia. But Europe is a different matter. Beijing will hesitate to push it away, and will wait for Europeans to make up their minds.\n\nWe can keep them waiting. We can keep them pondering. In a dangerous world, Europe is the holder of the balance.\n\nBruno Ma\u00e7\u00e3es, a former Europe minister for Portugal, is a senior adviser at Flint Global in London and a nonresident senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington.
