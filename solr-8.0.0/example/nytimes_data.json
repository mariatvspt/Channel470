Opponents feared a billion-dollar giveaway to one of the world\u2019s richest companies. How the deal to bring Amazon to New York City fell apart. It\u2019s Thursday, February 21.\n\narchived recording Amazon announced plans today to hire as many as 50,000 people to fill a brand new second corporate headquarters.\n\nj. david goodman So in the fall of 2017, Amazon declares publicly that they\u2019re going to look for a new headquarters site.\n\narchived recording The online retail giant currently based in Seattle wants to open its $5 billion second home near a North American city.\n\nj. david goodman Something that will be of equal size to what they had in Seattle, where they had about 50,000 jobs and sort of taken over whole swaths of the city. And they\u2019re going to do this somewhere else.\n\narchived recording Now cities and states will be vying for Amazon\u2019s attention.\n\nj. david goodman And they invited essentially the whole country to court them.\n\nmichael barbaro David Goodman covers New York politics for The Times.\n\nj. david goodman This was really seen by cities large and small across the country as something transformative.\n\narchived recording A win could transform a city, boosting its economy with tens of thousands of new jobs.\n\nj. david goodman I mean, these were not just jobs at a fulfillment center making sure the packages got to where they needed to go on time. These were going to be high paying jobs \u2014 they said on average $100,000.\n\narchived recording $100,000 or more for a salary. All of a sudden, people are leaving their jobs to try to go to get Amazon.\n\nj. david goodman This would be something that would all of a sudden, it would be a jolt of energy into that economy. And not just bring Amazon, but bring all the kinds of businesses that would congregate around a company campus of the size that they were proposing. So you\u2019d have restaurants, you\u2019d have service industries. You\u2019d have other tech companies around it. So the big companies spawn smaller companies.\n\nmichael barbaro They\u2019re magnets.\n\nj. david goodman Exactly.\n\nmichael barbaro Right. It was like, here\u2019s the nation\u2019s largest company telling all these cities in the country, all these towns, we may be about to shower gold on you. It\u2019s like an Ed McMahon Publishers Clearing House kind of moment, municipally speaking.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nmichael barbaro So how does this national search play out?\n\nj. david goodman I mean, this is almost like a application process to college. You had Amazon put out, essentially, what they wanted to see from each of the cities.\n\narchived recording Orlando is home to thinkers and innovators. After all, this is the region that took man to the moon.\n\nj. david goodman You know, the local schools, the local businesses, transit and transportation options. They had a lot of information that they wanted to get.\n\narchived recording Amazon. You\u2019re growing your business, and we want to grow with you. That\u2019s why we think Frisco, Texas is the perfect fit for HQ2.\n\nj. david goodman And this set off just a frenzy of activity in each of the cities.\n\narchived recording There is a huge, huge number of young millennials that is flocking to the Tampa Bay area.\n\nj. david goodman And not just in a few cities. You had over 200 different cities competing here.\n\narchived recording You\u2019ve probably heard something about Pittsburgh, the city that built America.\n\nj. david goodman You know, here\u2019s a video of all the different things that we could show Amazon.\n\narchived recording Detroit is always growing, always in flight.\n\nj. david goodman And they\u2019re trying to sort of whet the palate of Amazon\u2019s decision makers and get people trying to visit.\n\narchived recording Georgia wants Amazon to build its second headquarters there so badly that the city council voted that if chosen, they will de-annex a portion of the city and rename it Amazon.\n\nj. david goodman And this was something that really, you saw no city could pass up.\n\narchived recording The mayor of Kansas City tried a different tact, purchasing $1,000 worth of items on Amazon.\n\nj. david goodman And so they went sort of all in on this.\n\narchived recording Tucson, Arizona attempted a more natural approach, sending a 21-foot foot cactus to the company, which Amazon promptly donated to a desert museum.\n\nj. david goodman But the thing that the cities really focused on in terms of their offer to the company was, here\u2019s how we can give you financial incentives to come here. And that can take the form of direct subsidies, where the cities are actually paying Amazon directly to come. But they can also be tax incentives, which are, essentially, you don\u2019t have to pay taxes for, you know, years. And that\u2019s a very common way in economic development projects that companies are enticed to come in. There\u2019s also the question of land. Where would you put this? And cities have the power to put together parcels of land that might not be available to a private buyer. So that was another thing that they were looking for. What kinds of land do you have? Where are the places in your city that would be attractive for us to come?\n\narchived recording 6:26 and breaking news, Amazon is narrowing its list of candidate cities to be home to a second headquarters. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nj. david goodman And in early 2018, they come out with a list of, essentially, 20 finalists.\n\narchived recording Midwestern cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, and Columbus, Ohio are still in the running.\n\nj. david goodman That includes cities from all over the country, from Columbus, Ohio to Nashville.\n\narchived recording Los Angeles is still in the running.\n\nj. david goodman You had Los Angeles.\n\narchived recording Austin and Denver also on the list.\n\nj. david goodman Washington, D.C.\n\narchived recording A lot of large American cities, and then Toronto as well.\n\nj. david goodman And New York, where city officials actually had picked not one but four different sites across the city, in lower Manhattan, in Midtown on the West Side, in central Brooklyn and in Long Island City, Queens.\n\nmichael barbaro So New York actually submitted four different applications. That sounds incredibly New York.\n\nj. david goodman Oh, yeah. They couldn\u2019t decide which was the best, so they thought all these four would be the best.\n\nmichael barbaro And so how does Amazon vet these 20 finalist sites?\n\nj. david goodman So they have a team that\u2019s going to each of the sites, and they\u2019re looking at meeting with officials, meeting with the business groups, meeting with education leaders to see what sorts of offerings are in each place. And they\u2019re also getting a sense of what the amenities are, what the sort of fun things to do are in the city. When it came to New York, some of the things they did were ride around on Citi Bikes and take a sunset cruise on the city\u2019s new ferry system. And this was a way for city officials to not just show them, here\u2019s sort of the raw numbers of what is going to benefit you, but here\u2019s how you would integrate into this community. Here\u2019s how Amazon would sort of live if it chose to locate its headquarters here. And I mean, at this point, it really does start to feel like \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d dating program, where you would have Amazon as sort of the person who all these cities are trying to court and bring in. And Amazon is letting itself be courted in each city. And sort of, let\u2019s try this one out. Let\u2019s see how it would be to spend some time here. How would it be to spend some time over here?\n\nmichael barbaro And is there any indication from Amazon of which city they\u2019re going to choose, which city is going to get the rose?\n\nj. david goodman For a long time, there was absolutely no indication. But I don\u2019t think many people, especially in New York City, considered it. You know, New York City is crowded. New York City doesn\u2019t necessarily need a lot of jobs. New York City needs more affordable housing and better subway system improvements. And so there was a sense that they might like us, but, you know, they\u2019re going to go somewhere else that needs this infusion more than we do. And so suddenly, there was word that Amazon wasn\u2019t going to go to just one place, that they were going to split their headquarters in two.\n\nmichael barbaro Why?\n\nj. david goodman Well, they really realize, it seems, at the end, that there was no one place they wanted to be that would accommodate 50,000 people. And part of their desire here in finding a new headquarters was to get access to talent pools that they didn\u2019t have access to in Seattle. And being in two places gave them access to twice as many people.\n\nmichael barbaro Right. And so then what happens?\n\nj. david goodman So we hear that one of the spots is going to be outside of Washington, D.C. But there was mystery around what that second spot was going to be. And through our reporting, we were able to confirm that it was, in fact, New York City, to everyone\u2019s surprise. And, in fact, it was going to be Long Island City, Queens, an area that for most of the country was probably the first time they\u2019d ever heard of this area.\n\nmichael barbaro So after this yearlong search, the two winners are a suburb of Washington, D.C. and the Long Island City area of Queens. How do these two cities respond to being chosen?\n\nj. david goodman So in the suburbs of D.C. and Virginia, they\u2019re thrilled. In New York City \u2014\n\narchived recording O.K., the door is closed.\n\nj. david goodman It\u2019s a little more complicated.\n\narchived recording Questions on anything? Marcia?\n\nj. david goodman You saw at a press conference right out of the gate tough questions for the Amazon executive.\n\narchived recording So in Seattle now, there\u2019s a discussion a couple of years ago about how big tech companies like Amazon are driving up the property value, and how that is worsening the homelessness crisis over there. Did that come up in the discussions about \u2014\n\nj. david goodman And you saw the governor have to jump in and try and deflect some of these questions.\n\narchived recording New York press corps, nothing like it. You can either to do this or you can go to the dentist \u2014 with no anesthesia.\n\nj. david goodman And you saw opponents taking to the streets almost immediately and organizing a rally in opposition. [CHANTING IN SPANISH]\n\nmichael barbaro And what exactly is the basis for this immediate opposition?\n\nj. david goodman The opposition is coming from three different directions. There are unions that are opposed to Amazon for their labor practices, not just in New York City, but around the country, and really, around the world. And they see Amazon\u2019s coming to New York as an opportunity to make the point that this is a vast workforce of more than a half-million people, and there are no unionized labor. And so that\u2019s one bucket. The second bucket consists of local groups that looked at this arrival of Amazon not as a boon, but as a burden. That this was really going to hurt the community that it was coming to. It was going to increase cost of living, increase housing prices. It was going to burden the 7 train.\n\nmichael barbaro The 7 train being the local subway that goes out to Long Island City.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s exactly right. And so folks were concerned what this would actually do to the neighborhood that it was going to land in. And then you had a third group that was worried that the tax incentives and the other sorts of subsidies that were being given to this company should not be given. Because this is the most valuable company in the world run by the richest person in the world, and they don\u2019t need billions of dollars of city and state money.\n\nmichael barbaro And how big is the package of tax incentives? What does it consist of? And what is the logic of the tax incentives?\n\nj. david goodman The total package was nearly $3 billion for creating these 25 to 40,000 jobs. The one sort of direct subsidy was a cash grant to Amazon for constructing their headquarters. It was going to be $500 million. And the rest of it was going to come in the form of tax credits. And these were going to be given to Amazon in exchange for creating jobs. And so if they created a job, they got the tax break. And if they didn\u2019t create the job, they didn\u2019t get the tax break. And so the mayor was very adamant that these were the kinds \u2014 at least on the city side, these were the kinds of breaks that any company that moved to that particular area of Queens was entitled to. The fact that Amazon was promising to bring so many jobs meant that the tax break was going to be huge.\n\nmichael barbaro So the opposition is stemming, in summary, from unions who fear what Amazon will do to the future of work and organized labor in New York, people who were worried about being priced out of this neighborhood in Queens, where the headquarters will be located, and objections to the size of this tax deal to lure the company.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. And to some degree, that was entirely expected by the political leaders in New York City and New York state. It was common for this sort of deal to see that kind of opposition, you know, in a city like New York. But what no one could have anticipated was a political chain reaction that was going to be set off when a young sort of out-of-nowhere candidate who was progressive, who was liberal, who had been a bartender, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who ousted one of the most powerful people in Congress from the district just adjacent to where Amazon was thinking of locating its headquarters. And what that did was essentially embolden Democrats in general to think that they could take on some of the entrenched powers within the party and outside it. And so what you saw then in November was not only victories in New York flipping the State Senate into Democratic hands, but you saw all these House races going to young, much more left-of-center candidates. So suddenly, when Amazon announces that they\u2019re coming to Queens a few days after the election in November, they\u2019re now facing a sort of rejuvenated left, who were energized and who had organizing infrastructure \u2014 the lists that they had, the supporters. And they used that to fan out across this area of Queens and be very visible. And so the opponents were the loudest voices, and they were on the streets really hustling to say, this is not good for us. It took Amazon and the city sort of a while to realize that this opposition had any kind of legs to it.\n\narchived recording We\u2019re going to begin a hearing. Good morning, everyone.\n\nj. david goodman Then you had the first City Council hearing in December of last year. And nothing in the agreement needed Amazon to appear there.\n\narchived recording But we don\u2019t see this just as an investment. We\u2019ve made specific commitments already, and we will be joining with our neighbors to advocate for the future of Long Island City.\n\nj. david goodman But they were counseled and agreed that, you know, in order to smooth the political rough patches, it would be good to appear in public and talk about the deal. And they felt they could sell it, and it was a big disaster.\n\narchived recording Please, everyone. Please. [PROTESTERS CHANTING] I\u2019m going to give one more warning.\n\nj. david goodman The first city council hearing was a room packed with opponents who hurled slogans, chanted at them in some profane language.\n\narchived recording G-T-F-O, Amazon has got to go.\n\nj. david goodman Dropped a banner.\n\nmichael barbaro What did the matter say?\n\nj. david goodman The banner had what was sort of a canny repurposing of the Amazon logo, which is normally a smiley face. And they took it in an exact same sort of design, made it a frowny face, and it looked quite angry. And the Amazon executives weren\u2019t ready for this. They seemed shaken, and \u2014\n\narchived recording Amazon is a $1 trillion company, is that accurate?\n\nj. david goodman They had no supporters among the City Council members who were questioning them.\n\narchived recording (speaker 1) \u2014 close to that. So why should we give you this money?\n\narchived recording (speaker 2) So these incentives \u2014\n\nj. david goodman And they left in a huff after that. And then there\u2019s a second meeting a month later, and it doesn\u2019t go much better for Amazon. And in fact, they say on the record during this hearing something that is horrible to unions and most elected officials here.\n\narchived recording (speaker 1) Would you agree to neutrality if workers at Amazon wanted to unionize?\n\narchived recording (speaker 2) No, sir, we respect \u2014\n\narchived recording (speaker 1) You wouldn\u2019t agree to that?\n\narchived recording (speaker 2) Correct, sir. We would not.\n\nj. david goodman They\u2019re going to actively work to prevent unionization in New York City. So after that, you have a series of events culminating in the State Senate, which has recently gone into Democratic hands in the last election, delivering a win for opponents. They select a vocal critic in Queens to an essential board that had the power to veto this whole deal.\n\nmichael barbaro So things are definitively not going great for Amazon in New York.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. But still, nobody really thinks that this is going to fall apart. I mean, you still had the powerful governor of New York on the side of Amazon. And the mayor of New York, who\u2019s a self-described progressive, backing it and making the argument for it from that perspective. And so there is a feeling that this would be some rough waters, but that they would get through it.\n\nmichael barbaro And then what happens?\n\nj. david goodman So I\u2019m on my way to work last Thursday, and I get a call from someone who tells me about a union meeting that\u2019s happened between Amazon officials, orchestrated by the governor. And it seems as if there\u2019s actually progress toward some kind of deal \u2014 that they\u2019re going to maybe not make concessions, but have some terms where they could talk to the unions. And this seemed like, oh, this is how the supporters are going to get through this. So I arrive at work. I think, this is my story for the day. I\u2019m going to figure \u2014 you know, write how the supporters are actually gaining an edge here. And then I get a phone call. And it\u2019s someone who has direct knowledge of what\u2019s going on in the Amazon deal. And they say, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but it\u2019s over. It\u2019s off. They\u2019re leaving. [MUSIC] And it was a complete shock to me. It was probably the most shocking call I\u2019ve gotten in my journalistic life. And so I just got up with the cell phone still in my ear, and I walked over to our Metro editor, Cliff Levy, and I said, they\u2019re pulling out. Amazon\u2019s leaving. And he was also shocked. And everyone starts in motion \u2014 at this point, we haven\u2019t confirmed it, but this is a person who I had immense confidence in, who I\u2019d been dealing with. And then I get back to my desk, and I got a second call from someone else who thought they were actually bringing me the story. And they were very disappointed to know they were the second source on the story. And so within a few minutes, I heard from Amazon. And it was true, they were backing out in New York. And it was as if a bomb had gone off in the political world of New York City and across the country. It was something that no one expected. Everyone was in total shock. [MUSIC]\n\nmichael barbaro So David, what exactly happened here? How did this deal that didn\u2019t seem like it was in jeopardy suddenly fall through?\n\nj. david goodman Well, from Amazon\u2019s perspective, they saw themselves in years of political fighting. It had become an issue in local races. It was an issue for the City Council. I mean, they didn\u2019t imagine themselves getting dragged before hostile legislators periodically to justify whatever they were doing in New York.\n\nmichael barbaro They just saw lots and lots of trouble ahead.\n\nj. david goodman And their core business was being brought into it, as well. Their union posture was being threatened by some of the questioning that was coming from New York City. And for them, it appeared the costs were becoming higher than they were willing to bear.\n\nmichael barbaro What about the perspective of the opponents of this project? In their minds, how does this fall apart?\n\nj. david goodman For the opponents, they looked at what Amazon did, and it looked completely arbitrary and impulsive, like a child. And the favorite expression was that they took their ball and went home.\n\nmichael barbaro Right.\n\nj. david goodman And so there was all kinds of theories about why they would do so. But they all came back to this idea that Amazon really didn\u2019t want to talk to New Yorkers and hear their concerns and address them in some meaningful way. Maybe they went to a City Council hearing, but they didn\u2019t come back with any kind of offers. And then when things got tough for them politically, they didn\u2019t try and negotiate and find a way out. They simply left. And that was offensive to most people in New York City, who are used to and expect some level of dialogue. All along, opponents felt like New York City didn\u2019t need Amazon as much as Amazon needed New York City. And that was their argument for saying, these incentives are too much. We\u2019re not getting enough from the company. And in the end, it turned out that Amazon said to New York, we don\u2019t really need you as much as you think we do. And they left.\n\nmichael barbaro So ultimately, what are the consequences of a project of this scale in a place like New York collapsing?\n\nj. david goodman Strangely, it won\u2019t be that big a deal on the economic front. Now obviously, losing 25,000 jobs is something that has an effect. But New York is a place where tens of thousands of jobs are generated in the span of a few months routinely. But with those jobs, there was going to be tax revenue that came. And in fact, the state had estimated that if all the jobs they proposed had come, the city would have given up $3 billion in incentives in this grant, and would\u2019ve gotten $27 billion back in revenue. And so this is a nine to one equation, is what policymakers said. And that\u2019s not an insignificant amount of money. It could go a long way to fixing up the subway system and myriad other needs that the city has. But the bigger impact of this decision is around the kind of deal that happened here. This is an economic development deal that was bigger than the ones that we\u2019ve seen before, but was essentially something that was familiar to people. A company comes in, promises to do something. The politicians are glad to have the company come in, and everyone goes home happy. And the fact that not only were people unhappy here, but the unhappy folks won the day, says something about where this country is right now in terms of our relationship with corporations, our ability to effect change through grassroots organizing. For businesses like Amazon, this means that they can\u2019t any longer assume that they\u2019re going to be welcomed with open arms in especially the big cities that they come to.\n\nmichael barbaro And with giant tax packages.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s exactly right. I mean, they may have to make concessions and be open to conversations that they really don\u2019t want to have and don\u2019t expect to have right now. But what seems to be the bigger effect of this is on the political side.\n\narchived recording (alexandria ocasio-cortez) I think it\u2019s incredible. I mean, it shows that everyday Americans still have the power to organize and fight for their communities. And they can have more say in this country than the richest man in the world.\n\nj. david goodman Where you have some Democrats, and most prominently, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, hearing Amazon backing out as a win. And that creates for Republicans a ready-made talking point. I mean, this is the message that they\u2019ve wanted to deliver to attack Democrats for a long time. These are job killers. These are people who don\u2019t support business and will undermine the efforts to help communities grow. For Democrats, it\u2019s much more split and hard to know how to go forward.\n\nmichael barbaro How do you mean?\n\nj. david goodman Because it\u2019s hard to argue in the middle of the country, where places are hungering for jobs, that opposing corporations who want to bring jobs to a place is the right message for a 2020 candidate. At the same time, the energized part of the base in urban areas, where the Democratic Party is strongest, are voters who feel that the cost of living is too high, corporations have too much power, and we shouldn\u2019t just be handing over the keys to cities to different corporations and the wealthy that want to play there. And so I think the argument for Democrats is going to be much more difficult to make than Republicans, and it\u2019s going to be very difficult for Democrats to make outside of the urban centers and the coasts.\n\nmichael barbaro So this could end up coming back to haunt the Democrats, perhaps not right away, but maybe in 2020 at the presidential level, maybe beyond.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. [MUSIC]\n\nmichael barbaro David, what is Amazon going to do now that the second half of this second headquarters is not going to be in New York?\n\nj. david goodman One thing they\u2019ve said they\u2019re not going to do is start a new search. They\u2019re done with the public nationwide searching.\n\nmichael barbaro Kind of bruised by the experience.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. It didn\u2019t go well for them, at least in New York City. And they\u2019ve said instead that they\u2019re going to grow in the places that they already are. And that means the suburbs of Virginia, in Nashville and Seattle. And also, they\u2019re in New York City. They have about 5,000 employees who already work here. And they\u2019ve vowed to grow that number. And so you can imagine that over the course of a few years, they\u2019ll have 10,000 people working here. Maybe one day, they\u2019ll have 15,000 people. Maybe they\u2019ll even get up to 25,000 people at some point.\n\nmichael barbaro The same number that they would have dropped into Long Island City in this deal put together by the company and elected officials here.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. And they won\u2019t have gotten a dime of tax incentives to do that.\n\nmichael barbaro David, thank you very much."}, {"source": "nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/climate/climate-fwd-dairy-substitutes.html", "text": "It may seem unusual for a former leader of a nation to team up with a comedian to bring a message about climate change to the masses.

This year the podcast takes a deeper look at people around the world, particularly women, who are influencing the climate debate. \u201cClimate change is a man-made problem that requires a feminist solution\u201d is the show\u2019s tagline.\n\nMs. Robinson, who also leads The Mary Robinson Foundation-Climate Justice, has worked for many years to draw attention to links between rising emissions and inequality.

For 19 months, Mr. Trump and his team have had one target to shoot at, and that target has had limited jurisdiction. But now the investigation resembles the architecture of the internet, with many different nodes, and some of those nodes possess potentially unlimited jurisdiction. Their powers and scope go well beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s circumscribed mandate; they go to Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment and whether he lied to the American people. They also include law enforcement investigations having nothing to do with Russia, such as whether the president directed the commission of serious campaign finance crimes, as federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have already stated in filings. These are all critical matters, each with serious factual predicates already uncovered by prosecutors.\n\nHad Mr. Trump and his coterie done nothing wrong, they would have had little to fear from the special counsel, and a report from Mr. Mueller that cleared him would be the gold seal of approval. But Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior, including his dangling of pardons to witnesses in the investigation, makes total exoneration unlikely, even though it is enormously difficult to prosecute crimes with international dimensions and assertions of privilege. The investigation has been further clouded by the fact that people in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle lied repeatedly when it came to Russia (that long list includes Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone).\n\nSure, it is at least possible to envision the special counsel resolving each strand of the investigation and making such information public in detail.

It\u2019s a \u201cworldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy and kleptocracy\u201d against one toward \u201cstrengthening democracy, egalitarianism, and economic, social, racial and environmental justice.\u201d In this conception of the world, President Trump is just one of many \u201cdemagogues who exploit people\u2019s fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power.\u201d\n\nThese movements don\u2019t emerge out of nothing. Sanders contends that they are fueled by the enormous disparities of wealth and opportunity that define global capitalism. This is the subject of his Westminster College speech \u2014 an attempt to link domestic economic issues to relations among states. \u201cThis planet will not be secure or peaceful when so few have so much, and so many have so little \u2014 and when we advance day after day into an oligarchic form of society where a small number of extraordinarily powerful special interests exert enormous influence over the economic and political life of the world,\u201d Sanders said, adding later that \u201cinequality, corruption, oligarchy and authoritarianism are inseparable.\u201d\n\nAs for culprits, Sanders has a list. His Johns Hopkins address lists Vladimir Putin of Russia, Viktor Orban of Hungary, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia as part of this global nexus of corruption and autocracy. He also singles out American billionaires like Robert Mercer and Sheldon Adelson for \u201cpromoting a shared agenda of intolerance and bigotry\u201d as part of a \u201ccommon front\u201d of authoritarianism. And while Sanders was silent on Venezuela in these speeches, he has criticized the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in other venues, attacking its authoritarianism and suppression of democracy while rejecting intervention by the United States.\n\nIf these are the conditions of international relations, then the aim of American foreign policy should be to stand against this rising tide of illiberalism and oligarchy. For Sanders, the United States must create a global order that can constrain authoritarian states and bring democratic accountability to global capitalism.

Yet quality child care is unavailable or unaffordable.\n\nAnd the thing is, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Other wealthy countries either have national child care systems or subsidize care to put it in everyone\u2019s reach. It doesn\u2019t even cost all that much. While other advanced countries spend, on average, about three times as much as we do helping families \u2014 so much for our vaunted \u201cfamily values\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s still a relatively small part of their budgets. In particular, taking care of children is much cheaper than providing health care and retirement income to seniors, which even America does.\n\nFurthermore, caring for children doesn\u2019t just help them grow up to be productive adults. It also has immediate economic benefits, making it easier for parents to stay in the work force.\n\nOver the past 20 years, women\u2019s prime-age employment in the U.S. has lagged ever further behind the rest of the advanced world \u2014 at this point we\u2019re well below even Japan.

Americans may be concerned that lower spending reflects rationing of care, but research has consistently found that not to be the case. Other high-income countries spend less on health care than the United States because they have lower prices, not because they receive less care. In Germany, sickness funds leverage market power to secure lower prices, coming together regionally to negotiate contracts with doctors and hospitals, and nationally to negotiate drug prices.\n\nAdministrative and governance costs in multipayer systems are higher than in single-payer systems \u2014 5 percent of health spending in Germany compared with 3 percent in Canada. But there is much room to cut prices. If, for example, insurers were able, on average, to achieve hospital and physician prices at the level of Medicare, and prescription drug prices at the level of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the savings would be significant.\n\nWhile recent polls indicate that a majority of Americans support so-called Medicare for all, approval diminishes when the plan is explained or clarified. The former Starbucks chief executive, Howard Schultz, who is considering running for president, called the proposal to eliminate private health insurance \u201cnot American.\u201d A German-style multipayer road to universal coverage might receive a much warmer reception.\n\nAmericans have long valued choice and competition in their health care. The German model offers both: Patients choose private insurers that compete for enrollees, in the process driving innovation and improving quality. If the United States adopted this model, insurance companies would be more tightly regulated and required to become nonprofits, and some job losses would be likely. But they would not need to be eliminated, an idea suggested, and then retracted, by Ms. Harris in her call for Medicare for all.\n\nThe diversity of health financing arrangements globally demonstrates that there are many possible paths to achieving universal health care at an affordable cost \u2014 as Ms. Harris\u2019s advisers acknowledged after walking back her call for the elimination of private insurance.\n\nAdvocates and policymakers should pick carefully among these paths, choosing one that strikes a balance between what is possible and what is ideal for the United States health system. While the single-payer model serves Canada well, transitioning the United States to a multipayer model like Germany\u2019s would require a far smaller leap.

Since Nov. 19, Mr. Ghosn has been locked up in a small cell in a Tokyo detention center with a toilet in the corner, endlessly grilled by prosecutors without the right to have his lawyer present. Whatever Mr. Ghosn did or failed to do, this is not how justice is supposed to work.\n\nThe charges against Mr. Ghosn (pronounced \u201cGohn\u201d) are serious. He is accused of underreporting his income by more than $80 million over years and of moving personal trading losses temporarily onto Nissan books. In the immediate wake of his arrest, Mr. Ghosn was dismissed as chairman by Nissan and Mitsubishi, and he was subsequently forced out as chairman and chief executive officer of Renault, in the process losing tens of millions in pay and severance. Nissan is digging up more charges against Mr. Ghosn, and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States has begun its own investigation.\n\nThe story is a modern take on classic tragedy, the spectacular rise and even more spectacular fall of a larger-than-life business baron. Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest has generated reams of Japanese and foreign press reports on his wealth and extravagant life-style, including an elaborate wedding at the Palace of Versailles for which Renault purportedly paid part, and considerable speculation about a plot against him at Nissan, the Japanese automaker he restored to health but kept under the French umbrella of Renault. Though his total compensation might not shock Americans, it was considerably more than Japanese or French corporate chieftains make, which is offered as one reason he might have wanted to conceal the figures.\n\nNone of that, however, means that Mr. Ghosn, who insists he is innocent of all the charges against him, should be denied elemental legal protections, or bail.

Just 25 people attended the inaugural meeting of the Higher Education Case Managers Association, in 2008, the group said. By the end of this year, the association expects to have more than 900 members.\n\nAnd although colleges have increased the size of their counseling staffs, many campuses are still straining to keep up, forcing some institutions to rethink their treatment strategies.\n\nDaniel Eisenberg, a University of Michigan professor, said many colleges were also intrigued with the idea of online treatment, but were skeptical of its merits.\n\n\u201cOne of the best parts of campuses is that we have this in-person community where we can support students, so why start doing things online? It\u2019s a debate or question that\u2019s hanging over higher education,\u201d said Dr. Eisenberg, who is helping to lead a large study to better understand the effectiveness of online treatment.\n\nTraumatic incidents have helped other institutions revamp their intake processes. A 2010 shooting at the University of Texas led its counseling center to develop a crisis-response system now used to assess all students seeking mental health treatment.

Bukowski relished his image as a swaggering outsider, the kind of man who, having consented to read his poetry at a college, \u201cput down my poems and asked if anybody wanted to arm wrestle.\u201d (Someone did; naturally Bukowski won.) In \u201cOn Drinking,\u201d his escapades are entirely typical and roughly as follows: He goes to, copes with or barely avoids jail. He mouths off to cops. He gets into unprovoked fistfights that take three pages to describe and that involve dozens of barehanded punches to the head. He offers to clean a bar\u2019s dirty blinds for money and whiskey, and then, Tom Sawyer-style, persuades the other patrons to do the job for him. He is coated in vomit and/or blood with the regularity of an E.R. nurse. He pleasures, or fails to pleasure, scores of women, none of whom are dissuaded by the foregoing vomit or blood. And he wants nothing to do with modern writers who \u201clecture at universities / in tie and suit, / the little boys soberly studious, / the little girls with glazed eyes.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis boozy, cartoon machismo has generally served Bukowski well, in the sense that 25 years after his death he still has a sizable audience by the standards of a fiction writer and a colossal audience by the standards of a poet. As you might expect, that readership is not there for displays of technical prowess. The poems in \u201cOn Drinking\u201d are distinguishable from the prose mostly by virtue of line breaks that are inserted in why-not fashion; as in, \u201conce in Paris / drunk on national TV / before 50 million Frenchmen / I began babbling vulgar thoughts / and when the host put his hand over my / mouth / I leaped up from the round table \u2026\u201d There\u2019s basically no difference between these lines and the prose narrative that precedes them, except that the prose involves an extended brawl while the poem includes Bukowski pulling a knife on some French security guards.\n\nBut to say that Bukowski doesn\u2019t care about technique is not to say that his work is uncalculated. His relentlessly autobiographical approach leads to a dilemma that American poets in particular have been familiar with for well over half a century. This is the fact that, as the poet and critic Donald Davie once put it, a writer who trades on the raw facts of a rough life often \u201cconfesses to discreditable sentiments or behavior, but in doing so he demands credit for having the courage or the honesty of his shamelessness.\u201d Or in Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s slightly tarter formulation, such a writer is constantly saying, \u201cI do all these awful things \u2014 but don\u2019t you really think I\u2019m awfully nice?\u201d\n\nAnd Bukowski does want to seem awfully nice \u2014 very much so. It\u2019s interesting to go through \u201cOn Drinking\u201d and note the many things that Bukowski either omits or wants the reader to avoid thinking about. Consider \u201cnight school,\u201d which is set in \u201cthe drinking driver improvement school\u201d and involves \u201cthe test / to see if we have been listening / to the instructor.\u201d During a break, Bukowski naturally goes to get a beer, and later discovers he\u2019s the only person to have gotten all the test questions right, making him, the poem wryly concludes, \u201cthe class / intellectual.\u201d But why is he in the class? Because he was driving around drunk. Did he hurt anyone? Did he kill anyone? This is one of several times in \u201cOn Drinking\u201d that Bukowski talks about plowing around hammered in a car, yet every episode carefully avoids any sense of the possible horrific consequences for other people and returns us instead to the comfortable presence of that charming rogue, Charles Bukowski. He\u2019s so funny, so honest. You want to hang out with him, maybe have a few cold ones.\n\nBut this artfully contrived camaraderie is fragile. When a writer focuses more on forming a community with his readers than conveying the fact of an experience, he can be left high and dry when the assumptions undergirding that community change. People think about drunken driving much differently in 2019 than in 1981, when \u201cnight school\u201d was published. They also think differently about gender \u2014 and the women in \u201cOn Drinking\u201d only occasionally get names, although they do sometimes get ages. In a poem titled \u201cwho in the hell is Tom Jones?,\u201d we\u2019re told that Bukowski was \u201cshacked / with a 24-year-old / girl from New York / City\u201d when suddenly \u201cthis 34-year-old / woman / arrived,\u201d after which there was naturally a \u201cwhirling of wildcats\u201d that is delightful to Bukowski, because \u201cit\u2019s not often at the / age of 55 / that such splendid / action occurs.\u201d Readers in 2019 may well be blinded by the force of their eye roll."}, {"source": "nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion", "text": "9 U.S.\n\n\u2018Can The

And they\u2019re going to do this somewhere else.\n\narchived recording Now cities and states will be vying for Amazon\u2019s attention.\n\nj. david goodman And they invited essentially the whole country to court them.\n\nmichael barbaro David Goodman covers New York politics for The Times.\n\nj. david goodman This was really seen by cities large and small across the country as something transformative.\n\narchived recording A win could transform a city, boosting its economy with tens of thousands of new jobs.\n\nj. david goodman I mean, these were not just jobs at a fulfillment center making sure the packages got to where they needed to go on time. These were going to be high paying jobs \u2014 they said on average $100,000.\n\narchived recording $100,000 or more for a salary. All of a sudden, people are leaving their jobs to try to go to get Amazon.\n\nj. david goodman This would be something that would all of a sudden, it would be a jolt of energy into that economy. And not just bring Amazon, but bring all the kinds of businesses that would congregate around a company campus of the size that they were proposing. So you\u2019d have restaurants, you\u2019d have service industries. You\u2019d have other tech companies around it. So the big companies spawn smaller companies.\n\nmichael barbaro They\u2019re magnets.\n\nj. david goodman Exactly.\n\nmichael barbaro Right. It was like, here\u2019s the nation\u2019s largest company telling all these cities in the country, all these towns, we may be about to shower gold on you. It\u2019s like an Ed McMahon Publishers Clearing House kind of moment, municipally speaking.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nmichael barbaro So how does this national search play out?\n\nj. david goodman I mean, this is almost like a application process to college. You had Amazon put out, essentially, what they wanted to see from each of the cities.\n\narchived recording Orlando is home to thinkers and innovators. After all, this is the region that took man to the moon.\n\nj. david goodman You know, the local schools, the local businesses, transit and transportation options. They had a lot of information that they wanted to get.\n\narchived recording Amazon. You\u2019re growing your business, and we want to grow with you. That\u2019s why we think Frisco, Texas is the perfect fit for HQ2.\n\nj. david goodman And this set off just a frenzy of activity in each of the cities.\n\narchived recording There is a huge, huge number of young millennials that is flocking to the Tampa Bay area.\n\nj. david goodman And not just in a few cities. You had over 200 different cities competing here.\n\narchived recording You\u2019ve probably heard something about Pittsburgh, the city that built America.\n\nj. david goodman You know, here\u2019s a video of all the different things that we could show Amazon.\n\narchived recording Detroit is always growing, always in flight.\n\nj. david goodman And they\u2019re trying to sort of whet the palate of Amazon\u2019s decision makers and get people trying to visit.\n\narchived recording Georgia wants Amazon to build its second headquarters there so badly that the city council voted that if chosen, they will de-annex a portion of the city and rename it Amazon.\n\nj. david goodman And this was something that really, you saw no city could pass up.\n\narchived recording The mayor of Kansas City tried a different tact, purchasing $1,000 worth of items on Amazon.\n\nj. david goodman And so they went sort of all in on this.\n\narchived recording Tucson, Arizona attempted a more natural approach, sending a 21-foot foot cactus to the company, which Amazon promptly donated to a desert museum.\n\nj. david goodman But the thing that the cities really focused on in terms of their offer to the company was, here\u2019s how we can give you financial incentives to come here. And that can take the form of direct subsidies, where the cities are actually paying Amazon directly to come. But they can also be tax incentives, which are, essentially, you don\u2019t have to pay taxes for, you know, years. And that\u2019s a very common way in economic development projects that companies are enticed to come in. There\u2019s also the question of land. Where would you put this? And cities have the power to put together parcels of land that might not be available to a private buyer. So that was another thing that they were looking for. What kinds of land do you have? Where are the places in your city that would be attractive for us to come?\n\narchived recording 6:26 and breaking news, Amazon is narrowing its list of candidate cities to be home to a second headquarters. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nj. david goodman And in early 2018, they come out with a list of, essentially, 20 finalists.\n\narchived recording Midwestern cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, and Columbus, Ohio are still in the running.\n\nj. david goodman That includes cities from all over the country, from Columbus, Ohio to Nashville.\n\narchived recording Los Angeles is still in the running.\n\nj. david goodman You had Los Angeles.\n\narchived recording Austin and Denver also on the list.\n\nj. david goodman Washington, D.C.\n\narchived recording A lot of large American cities, and then Toronto as well.\n\nj. david goodman And New York, where city officials actually had picked not one but four different sites across the city, in lower Manhattan, in Midtown on the West Side, in central Brooklyn and in Long Island City, Queens.\n\nmichael barbaro So New York actually submitted four different applications. That sounds incredibly New York.\n\nj. david goodman Oh, yeah. They couldn\u2019t decide which was the best, so they thought all these four would be the best.\n\nmichael barbaro And so how does Amazon vet these 20 finalist sites?\n\nj. david goodman So they have a team that\u2019s going to each of the sites, and they\u2019re looking at meeting with officials, meeting with the business groups, meeting with education leaders to see what sorts of offerings are in each place. And they\u2019re also getting a sense of what the amenities are, what the sort of fun things to do are in the city. When it came to New York, some of the things they did were ride around on Citi Bikes and take a sunset cruise on the city\u2019s new ferry system. And this was a way for city officials to not just show them, here\u2019s sort of the raw numbers of what is going to benefit you, but here\u2019s how you would integrate into this community. Here\u2019s how Amazon would sort of live if it chose to locate its headquarters here. And I mean, at this point, it really does start to feel like \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d dating program, where you would have Amazon as sort of the person who all these cities are trying to court and bring in. And Amazon is letting itself be courted in each city. And sort of, let\u2019s try this one out. Let\u2019s see how it would be to spend some time here. How would it be to spend some time over here?\n\nmichael barbaro And is there any indication from Amazon of which city they\u2019re going to choose, which city is going to get the rose?\n\nj. david goodman For a long time, there was absolutely no indication. But I don\u2019t think many people, especially in New York City, considered it. You know, New York City is crowded. New York City doesn\u2019t necessarily need a lot of jobs. New York City needs more affordable housing and better subway system improvements. And so there was a sense that they might like us, but, you know, they\u2019re going to go somewhere else that needs this infusion more than we do. And so suddenly, there was word that Amazon wasn\u2019t going to go to just one place, that they were going to split their headquarters in two.\n\nmichael barbaro Why?\n\nj. david goodman Well, they really realize, it seems, at the end, that there was no one place they wanted to be that would accommodate 50,000 people. And part of their desire here in finding a new headquarters was to get access to talent pools that they didn\u2019t have access to in Seattle. And being in two places gave them access to twice as many people.\n\nmichael barbaro Right. And so then what happens?\n\nj. david goodman So we hear that one of the spots is going to be outside of Washington, D.C. But there was mystery around what that second spot was going to be. And through our reporting, we were able to confirm that it was, in fact, New York City, to everyone\u2019s surprise. And, in fact, it was going to be Long Island City, Queens, an area that for most of the country was probably the first time they\u2019d ever heard of this area.\n\nmichael barbaro So after this yearlong search, the two winners are a suburb of Washington, D.C. and the Long Island City area of Queens. How do these two cities respond to being chosen?\n\nj. david goodman So in the suburbs of D.C. and Virginia, they\u2019re thrilled. In New York City \u2014\n\narchived recording O.K., the door is closed.\n\nj. david goodman It\u2019s a little more complicated.\n\narchived recording Questions on anything? Marcia?\n\nj. david goodman You saw at a press conference right out of the gate tough questions for the Amazon executive.\n\narchived recording So in Seattle now, there\u2019s a discussion a couple of years ago about how big tech companies like Amazon are driving up the property value, and how that is worsening the homelessness crisis over there. Did that come up in the discussions about \u2014\n\nj. david goodman And you saw the governor have to jump in and try and deflect some of these questions.\n\narchived recording New York press corps, nothing like it. You can either to do this or you can go to the dentist \u2014 with no anesthesia.\n\nj. david goodman And you saw opponents taking to the streets almost immediately and organizing a rally in opposition. [CHANTING IN SPANISH]\n\nmichael barbaro And what exactly is the basis for this immediate opposition?\n\nj. david goodman The opposition is coming from three different directions. There are unions that are opposed to Amazon for their labor practices, not just in New York City, but around the country, and really, around the world. And they see Amazon\u2019s coming to New York as an opportunity to make the point that this is a vast workforce of more than a half-million people, and there are no unionized labor. And so that\u2019s one bucket. The second bucket consists of local groups that looked at this arrival of Amazon not as a boon, but as a burden. That this was really going to hurt the community that it was coming to. It was going to increase cost of living, increase housing prices. It was going to burden the 7 train.\n\nmichael barbaro The 7 train being the local subway that goes out to Long Island City.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s exactly right. And so folks were concerned what this would actually do to the neighborhood that it was going to land in. And then you had a third group that was worried that the tax incentives and the other sorts of subsidies that were being given to this company should not be given. Because this is the most valuable company in the world run by the richest person in the world, and they don\u2019t need billions of dollars of city and state money.\n\nmichael barbaro And how big is the package of tax incentives? What does it consist of? And what is the logic of the tax incentives?\n\nj. david goodman The total package was nearly $3 billion for creating these 25 to 40,000 jobs. The one sort of direct subsidy was a cash grant to Amazon for constructing their headquarters. It was going to be $500 million. And the rest of it was going to come in the form of tax credits. And these were going to be given to Amazon in exchange for creating jobs. And so if they created a job, they got the tax break. And if they didn\u2019t create the job, they didn\u2019t get the tax break. And so the mayor was very adamant that these were the kinds \u2014 at least on the city side, these were the kinds of breaks that any company that moved to that particular area of Queens was entitled to. The fact that Amazon was promising to bring so many jobs meant that the tax break was going to be huge.\n\nmichael barbaro So the opposition is stemming, in summary, from unions who fear what Amazon will do to the future of work and organized labor in New York, people who were worried about being priced out of this neighborhood in Queens, where the headquarters will be located, and objections to the size of this tax deal to lure the company.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. And to some degree, that was entirely expected by the political leaders in New York City and New York state. It was common for this sort of deal to see that kind of opposition, you know, in a city like New York. But what no one could have anticipated was a political chain reaction that was going to be set off when a young sort of out-of-nowhere candidate who was progressive, who was liberal, who had been a bartender, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who ousted one of the most powerful people in Congress from the district just adjacent to where Amazon was thinking of locating its headquarters. And what that did was essentially embolden Democrats in general to think that they could take on some of the entrenched powers within the party and outside it. And so what you saw then in November was not only victories in New York flipping the State Senate into Democratic hands, but you saw all these House races going to young, much more left-of-center candidates. So suddenly, when Amazon announces that they\u2019re coming to Queens a few days after the election in November, they\u2019re now facing a sort of rejuvenated left, who were energized and who had organizing infrastructure \u2014 the lists that they had, the supporters. And they used that to fan out across this area of Queens and be very visible. And so the opponents were the loudest voices, and they were on the streets really hustling to say, this is not good for us. It took Amazon and the city sort of a while to realize that this opposition had any kind of legs to it.\n\narchived recording We\u2019re going to begin a hearing. Good morning, everyone.\n\nj. david goodman Then you had the first City Council hearing in December of last year. And nothing in the agreement needed Amazon to appear there.\n\narchived recording But we don\u2019t see this just as an investment. We\u2019ve made specific commitments already, and we will be joining with our neighbors to advocate for the future of Long Island City.\n\nj. david goodman But they were counseled and agreed that, you know, in order to smooth the political rough patches, it would be good to appear in public and talk about the deal. And they felt they could sell it, and it was a big disaster.\n\narchived recording Please, everyone. Please. [PROTESTERS CHANTING] I\u2019m going to give one more warning.\n\nj. david goodman The first city council hearing was a room packed with opponents who hurled slogans, chanted at them in some profane language.\n\narchived recording G-T-F-O, Amazon has got to go.\n\nj. david goodman Dropped a banner.\n\nmichael barbaro What did the matter say?\n\nj. david goodman The banner had what was sort of a canny repurposing of the Amazon logo, which is normally a smiley face. And they took it in an exact same sort of design, made it a frowny face, and it looked quite angry. And the Amazon executives weren\u2019t ready for this. They seemed shaken, and \u2014\n\narchived recording Amazon is a $1 trillion company, is that accurate?\n\nj. david goodman They had no supporters among the City Council members who were questioning them.\n\narchived recording (speaker 1) \u2014 close to that. So why should we give you this money?\n\narchived recording (speaker 2) So these incentives \u2014\n\nj. david goodman And they left in a huff after that. And then there\u2019s a second meeting a month later, and it doesn\u2019t go much better for Amazon. And in fact, they say on the record during this hearing something that is horrible to unions and most elected officials here.\n\narchived recording (speaker 1) Would you agree to neutrality if workers at Amazon wanted to unionize?\n\narchived recording (speaker 2) No, sir, we respect \u2014\n\narchived recording (speaker 1) You wouldn\u2019t agree to that?\n\narchived recording (speaker 2) Correct, sir. We would not.\n\nj. david goodman They\u2019re going to actively work to prevent unionization in New York City. So after that, you have a series of events culminating in the State Senate, which has recently gone into Democratic hands in the last election, delivering a win for opponents. They select a vocal critic in Queens to an essential board that had the power to veto this whole deal.\n\nmichael barbaro So things are definitively not going great for Amazon in New York.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. But still, nobody really thinks that this is going to fall apart. I mean, you still had the powerful governor of New York on the side of Amazon. And the mayor of New York, who\u2019s a self-described progressive, backing it and making the argument for it from that perspective. And so there is a feeling that this would be some rough waters, but that they would get through it.\n\nmichael barbaro And then what happens?\n\nj. david goodman So I\u2019m on my way to work last Thursday, and I get a call from someone who tells me about a union meeting that\u2019s happened between Amazon officials, orchestrated by the governor. And it seems as if there\u2019s actually progress toward some kind of deal \u2014 that they\u2019re going to maybe not make concessions, but have some terms where they could talk to the unions. And this seemed like, oh, this is how the supporters are going to get through this. So I arrive at work. I think, this is my story for the day. I\u2019m going to figure \u2014 you know, write how the supporters are actually gaining an edge here. And then I get a phone call. And it\u2019s someone who has direct knowledge of what\u2019s going on in the Amazon deal. And they say, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but it\u2019s over. It\u2019s off. They\u2019re leaving. [MUSIC] And it was a complete shock to me. It was probably the most shocking call I\u2019ve gotten in my journalistic life. And so I just got up with the cell phone still in my ear, and I walked over to our Metro editor, Cliff Levy, and I said, they\u2019re pulling out. Amazon\u2019s leaving. And he was also shocked. And everyone starts in motion \u2014 at this point, we haven\u2019t confirmed it, but this is a person who I had immense confidence in, who I\u2019d been dealing with. And then I get back to my desk, and I got a second call from someone else who thought they were actually bringing me the story. And they were very disappointed to know they were the second source on the story. And so within a few minutes, I heard from Amazon. And it was true, they were backing out in New York. And it was as if a bomb had gone off in the political world of New York City and across the country. It was something that no one expected. Everyone was in total shock. [MUSIC]\n\nmichael barbaro So David, what exactly happened here? How did this deal that didn\u2019t seem like it was in jeopardy suddenly fall through?\n\nj. david goodman Well, from Amazon\u2019s perspective, they saw themselves in years of political fighting. It had become an issue in local races. It was an issue for the City Council. I mean, they didn\u2019t imagine themselves getting dragged before hostile legislators periodically to justify whatever they were doing in New York.\n\nmichael barbaro They just saw lots and lots of trouble ahead.\n\nj. david goodman And their core business was being brought into it, as well. Their union posture was being threatened by some of the questioning that was coming from New York City. And for them, it appeared the costs were becoming higher than they were willing to bear.\n\nmichael barbaro What about the perspective of the opponents of this project? In their minds, how does this fall apart?\n\nj. david goodman For the opponents, they looked at what Amazon did, and it looked completely arbitrary and impulsive, like a child. And the favorite expression was that they took their ball and went home.\n\nmichael barbaro Right.\n\nj. david goodman And so there was all kinds of theories about why they would do so. But they all came back to this idea that Amazon really didn\u2019t want to talk to New Yorkers and hear their concerns and address them in some meaningful way. Maybe they went to a City Council hearing, but they didn\u2019t come back with any kind of offers. And then when things got tough for them politically, they didn\u2019t try and negotiate and find a way out. They simply left. And that was offensive to most people in New York City, who are used to and expect some level of dialogue. All along, opponents felt like New York City didn\u2019t need Amazon as much as Amazon needed New York City. And that was their argument for saying, these incentives are too much. We\u2019re not getting enough from the company. And in the end, it turned out that Amazon said to New York, we don\u2019t really need you as much as you think we do. And they left.\n\nmichael barbaro So ultimately, what are the consequences of a project of this scale in a place like New York collapsing?\n\nj. david goodman Strangely, it won\u2019t be that big a deal on the economic front. Now obviously, losing 25,000 jobs is something that has an effect. But New York is a place where tens of thousands of jobs are generated in the span of a few months routinely. But with those jobs, there was going to be tax revenue that came. And in fact, the state had estimated that if all the jobs they proposed had come, the city would have given up $3 billion in incentives in this grant, and would\u2019ve gotten $27 billion back in revenue. And so this is a nine to one equation, is what policymakers said. And that\u2019s not an insignificant amount of money. It could go a long way to fixing up the subway system and myriad other needs that the city has. But the bigger impact of this decision is around the kind of deal that happened here. This is an economic development deal that was bigger than the ones that we\u2019ve seen before, but was essentially something that was familiar to people. A company comes in, promises to do something. The politicians are glad to have the company come in, and everyone goes home happy. And the fact that not only were people unhappy here, but the unhappy folks won the day, says something about where this country is right now in terms of our relationship with corporations, our ability to effect change through grassroots organizing. For businesses like Amazon, this means that they can\u2019t any longer assume that they\u2019re going to be welcomed with open arms in especially the big cities that they come to.\n\nmichael barbaro And with giant tax packages.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s exactly right. I mean, they may have to make concessions and be open to conversations that they really don\u2019t want to have and don\u2019t expect to have right now. But what seems to be the bigger effect of this is on the political side.\n\narchived recording (alexandria ocasio-cortez) I think it\u2019s incredible. I mean, it shows that everyday Americans still have the power to organize and fight for their communities. And they can have more say in this country than the richest man in the world.\n\nj. david goodman Where you have some Democrats, and most prominently, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, hearing Amazon backing out as a win. And that creates for Republicans a ready-made talking point. I mean, this is the message that they\u2019ve wanted to deliver to attack Democrats for a long time. These are job killers. These are people who don\u2019t support business and will undermine the efforts to help communities grow. For Democrats, it\u2019s much more split and hard to know how to go forward.\n\nmichael barbaro How do you mean?\n\nj. david goodman Because it\u2019s hard to argue in the middle of the country, where places are hungering for jobs, that opposing corporations who want to bring jobs to a place is the right message for a 2020 candidate. At the same time, the energized part of the base in urban areas, where the Democratic Party is strongest, are voters who feel that the cost of living is too high, corporations have too much power, and we shouldn\u2019t just be handing over the keys to cities to different corporations and the wealthy that want to play there. And so I think the argument for Democrats is going to be much more difficult to make than Republicans, and it\u2019s going to be very difficult for Democrats to make outside of the urban centers and the coasts.\n\nmichael barbaro So this could end up coming back to haunt the Democrats, perhaps not right away, but maybe in 2020 at the presidential level, maybe beyond.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. [MUSIC]\n\nmichael barbaro David, what is Amazon going to do now that the second half of this second headquarters is not going to be in New York?\n\nj. david goodman One thing they\u2019ve said they\u2019re not going to do is start a new search. They\u2019re done with the public nationwide searching.\n\nmichael barbaro Kind of bruised by the experience.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. It didn\u2019t go well for them, at least in New York City. And they\u2019ve said instead that they\u2019re going to grow in the places that they already are. And that means the suburbs of Virginia, in Nashville and Seattle. And also, they\u2019re in New York City. They have about 5,000 employees who already work here. And they\u2019ve vowed to grow that number. And so you can imagine that over the course of a few years, they\u2019ll have 10,000 people working here. Maybe one day, they\u2019ll have 15,000 people. Maybe they\u2019ll even get up to 25,000 people at some point.\n\nmichael barbaro The same number that they would have dropped into Long Island City in this deal put together by the company and elected officials here.\n\nj. david goodman That\u2019s right. And they won\u2019t have gotten a dime of tax incentives to do that.\n\nmichael barbaro David, thank you very much."}, {"source": "nytimes", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/climate/climate-fwd-dairy-substitutes.html", "text": "It may seem unusual for a former leader of a nation to team up with a comedian to bring a message about climate change to the masses.

For him, the ideological struggle of the 21st century doesn\u2019t pit a liberal, democratic America against illiberal, authoritarian opponents, but instead pits liberal, democratic peoples everywhere against illiberalism at home and abroad. It\u2019s a \u201cworldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy and kleptocracy\u201d against one toward \u201cstrengthening democracy, egalitarianism, and economic, social, racial and environmental justice.\u201d In this conception of the world, President Trump is just one of many \u201cdemagogues who exploit people\u2019s fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power.\u201d\n\nThese movements don\u2019t emerge out of nothing. Sanders contends that they are fueled by the enormous disparities of wealth and opportunity that define global capitalism. This is the subject of his Westminster College speech \u2014 an attempt to link domestic economic issues to relations among states. \u201cThis planet will not be secure or peaceful when so few have so much, and so many have so little \u2014 and when we advance day after day into an oligarchic form of society where a small number of extraordinarily powerful special interests exert enormous influence over the economic and political life of the world,\u201d Sanders said, adding later that \u201cinequality, corruption, oligarchy and authoritarianism are inseparable.\u201d\n\nAs for culprits, Sanders has a list. His Johns Hopkins address lists Vladimir Putin of Russia, Viktor Orban of Hungary, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia as part of this global nexus of corruption and autocracy. He also singles out American billionaires like Robert Mercer and Sheldon Adelson for \u201cpromoting a shared agenda of intolerance and bigotry\u201d as part of a \u201ccommon front\u201d of authoritarianism. And while Sanders was silent on Venezuela in these speeches, he has criticized the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in other venues, attacking its authoritarianism and suppression of democracy while rejecting intervention by the United States.\n\nIf these are the conditions of international relations, then the aim of American foreign policy should be to stand against this rising tide of illiberalism and oligarchy. For Sanders, the United States must create a global order that can constrain authoritarian states and bring democratic accountability to global capitalism. It must also embrace the cooperation necessary for tackling climate change and other transnational challenges, building \u201cpartnerships not just between governments, but between peoples\u201d and recognizing that \u201cour safety and welfare is bound up with the safety and welfare of others around the world.\u201d\n\nFor this project to succeed, however, Americans must also strive for fairness and equality in their own country. \u201cIf we are going to expound the virtues of democracy and justice abroad, and be taken seriously, we need to practice those values here at home,\u201d Sanders says."}, {"source": "nytimes", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/opinion/warren-child-care.html", "text": "For millions of Americans with children, life is a constant, desperate balancing act.

Yet quality child care is unavailable or unaffordable.\n\nAnd the thing is, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Other wealthy countries either have national child care systems or subsidize care to put it in everyone\u2019s reach. It doesn\u2019t even cost all that much. While other advanced countries spend, on average, about three times as much as we do helping families \u2014 so much for our vaunted \u201cfamily values\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s still a relatively small part of their budgets. In particular, taking care of children is much cheaper than providing health care and retirement income to seniors, which even America does.\n\nFurthermore, caring for children doesn\u2019t just help them grow up to be productive adults. It also has immediate economic benefits, making it easier for parents to stay in the work force.\n\nOver the past 20 years, women\u2019s prime-age employment in the U.S. has lagged ever further behind the rest of the advanced world \u2014 at this point we\u2019re well below even Japan.

Americans may be concerned that lower spending reflects rationing of care, but research has consistently found that not to be the case. Other high-income countries spend less on health care than the United States because they have lower prices, not because they receive less care. In Germany, sickness funds leverage market power to secure lower prices, coming together regionally to negotiate contracts with doctors and hospitals, and nationally to negotiate drug prices.\n\nAdministrative and governance costs in multipayer systems are higher than in single-payer systems \u2014 5 percent of health spending in Germany compared with 3 percent in Canada. But there is much room to cut prices. If, for example, insurers were able, on average, to achieve hospital and physician prices at the level of Medicare, and prescription drug prices at the level of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the savings would be significant.\n\nWhile recent polls indicate that a majority of Americans support so-called Medicare for all, approval diminishes when the plan is explained or clarified. The former Starbucks chief executive, Howard Schultz, who is considering running for president, called the proposal to eliminate private health insurance \u201cnot American.\u201d A German-style multipayer road to universal coverage might receive a much warmer reception.\n\nAmericans have long valued choice and competition in their health care. The German model offers both: Patients choose private insurers that compete for enrollees, in the process driving innovation and improving quality. If the United States adopted this model, insurance companies would be more tightly regulated and required to become nonprofits, and some job losses would be likely. But they would not need to be eliminated, an idea suggested, and then retracted, by Ms. Harris in her call for Medicare for all.\n\nThe diversity of health financing arrangements globally demonstrates that there are many possible paths to achieving universal health care at an affordable cost \u2014 as Ms. Harris\u2019s advisers acknowledged after walking back her call for the elimination of private insurance.\n\nAdvocates and policymakers should pick carefully among these paths, choosing one that strikes a balance between what is possible and what is ideal for the United States health system. While the single-payer model serves Canada well, transitioning the United States to a multipayer model like Germany\u2019s would require a far smaller leap.

Since Nov. 19, Mr. Ghosn has been locked up in a small cell in a Tokyo detention center with a toilet in the corner, endlessly grilled by prosecutors without the right to have his lawyer present. Whatever Mr. Ghosn did or failed to do, this is not how justice is supposed to work.\n\nThe charges against Mr. Ghosn (pronounced \u201cGohn\u201d) are serious. He is accused of underreporting his income by more than $80 million over years and of moving personal trading losses temporarily onto Nissan books. In the immediate wake of his arrest, Mr. Ghosn was dismissed as chairman by Nissan and Mitsubishi, and he was subsequently forced out as chairman and chief executive officer of Renault, in the process losing tens of millions in pay and severance. Nissan is digging up more charges against Mr. Ghosn, and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States has begun its own investigation.\n\nThe story is a modern take on classic tragedy, the spectacular rise and even more spectacular fall of a larger-than-life business baron. Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest has generated reams of Japanese and foreign press reports on his wealth and extravagant life-style, including an elaborate wedding at the Palace of Versailles for which Renault purportedly paid part, and considerable speculation about a plot against him at Nissan, the Japanese automaker he restored to health but kept under the French umbrella of Renault. Though his total compensation might not shock Americans, it was considerably more than Japanese or French corporate chieftains make, which is offered as one reason he might have wanted to conceal the figures.\n\nNone of that, however, means that Mr. Ghosn, who insists he is innocent of all the charges against him, should be denied elemental legal protections, or bail.

Just 25 people attended the inaugural meeting of the Higher Education Case Managers Association, in 2008, the group said. By the end of this year, the association expects to have more than 900 members.\n\nAnd although colleges have increased the size of their counseling staffs, many campuses are still straining to keep up, forcing some institutions to rethink their treatment strategies.\n\nDaniel Eisenberg, a University of Michigan professor, said many colleges were also intrigued with the idea of online treatment, but were skeptical of its merits.\n\n\u201cOne of the best parts of campuses is that we have this in-person community where we can support students, so why start doing things online? It\u2019s a debate or question that\u2019s hanging over higher education,\u201d said Dr. Eisenberg, who is helping to lead a large study to better understand the effectiveness of online treatment.\n\nTraumatic incidents have helped other institutions revamp their intake processes. A 2010 shooting at the University of Texas led its counseling center to develop a crisis-response system now used to assess all students seeking mental health treatment.

Bukowski relished his image as a swaggering outsider, the kind of man who, having consented to read his poetry at a college, \u201cput down my poems and asked if anybody wanted to arm wrestle.\u201d (Someone did; naturally Bukowski won.) In \u201cOn Drinking,\u201d his escapades are entirely typical and roughly as follows: He goes to, copes with or barely avoids jail. He mouths off to cops. He gets into unprovoked fistfights that take three pages to describe and that involve dozens of barehanded punches to the head. He offers to clean a bar\u2019s dirty blinds for money and whiskey, and then, Tom Sawyer-style, persuades the other patrons to do the job for him. He is coated in vomit and/or blood with the regularity of an E.R. nurse. He pleasures, or fails to pleasure, scores of women, none of whom are dissuaded by the foregoing vomit or blood. And he wants nothing to do with modern writers who \u201clecture at universities / in tie and suit, / the little boys soberly studious, / the little girls with glazed eyes.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis boozy, cartoon machismo has generally served Bukowski well, in the sense that 25 years after his death he still has a sizable audience by the standards of a fiction writer and a colossal audience by the standards of a poet. As you might expect, that readership is not there for displays of technical prowess. The poems in \u201cOn Drinking\u201d are distinguishable from the prose mostly by virtue of line breaks that are inserted in why-not fashion; as in, \u201conce in Paris / drunk on national TV / before 50 million Frenchmen / I began babbling vulgar thoughts / and when the host put his hand over my / mouth / I leaped up from the round table \u2026\u201d There\u2019s basically no difference between these lines and the prose narrative that precedes them, except that the prose involves an extended brawl while the poem includes Bukowski pulling a knife on some French security guards.\n\nBut to say that Bukowski doesn\u2019t care about technique is not to say that his work is uncalculated. His relentlessly autobiographical approach leads to a dilemma that American poets in particular have been familiar with for well over half a century. This is the fact that, as the poet and critic Donald Davie once put it, a writer who trades on the raw facts of a rough life often \u201cconfesses to discreditable sentiments or behavior, but in doing so he demands credit for having the courage or the honesty of his shamelessness.\u201d Or in Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s slightly tarter formulation, such a writer is constantly saying, \u201cI do all these awful things \u2014 but don\u2019t you really think I\u2019m awfully nice?\u201d\n\nAnd Bukowski does want to seem awfully nice \u2014 very much so. It\u2019s interesting to go through \u201cOn Drinking\u201d and note the many things that Bukowski either omits or wants the reader to avoid thinking about. Consider \u201cnight school,\u201d which is set in \u201cthe drinking driver improvement school\u201d and involves \u201cthe test / to see if we have been listening / to the instructor.\u201d During a break, Bukowski naturally goes to get a beer, and later discovers he\u2019s the only person to have gotten all the test questions right, making him, the poem wryly concludes, \u201cthe class / intellectual.\u201d But why is he in the class? Because he was driving around drunk. Did he hurt anyone? Did he kill anyone? This is one of several times in \u201cOn Drinking\u201d that Bukowski talks about plowing around hammered in a car, yet every episode carefully avoids any sense of the possible horrific consequences for other people and returns us instead to the comfortable presence of that charming rogue, Charles Bukowski. He\u2019s so funny, so honest. You want to hang out with him, maybe have a few cold ones.\n\nBut this artfully contrived camaraderie is fragile. When a writer focuses more on forming a community with his readers than conveying the fact of an experience, he can be left high and dry when the assumptions undergirding that community change. People think about drunken driving much differently in 2019 than in 1981, when \u201cnight school\u201d was published. They also think differently about gender \u2014 and the women in \u201cOn Drinking\u201d only occasionally get names, although they do sometimes get ages. In a poem titled \u201cwho in the hell is Tom Jones?,\u201d we\u2019re told that Bukowski was \u201cshacked / with a 24-year-old / girl from New York / City\u201d when suddenly \u201cthis 34-year-old / woman / arrived,\u201d after which there was naturally a \u201cwhirling of wildcats\u201d that is delightful to Bukowski, because \u201cit\u2019s not often at the / age of 55 / that such splendid / action occurs.\u201d Readers in 2019 may well be blinded by the force of their eye roll."}, {"source": "nytimes", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020031-baked-barley-risotto-with-mushrooms-and-carrots?module=Recipe+of+The+Day&pgType=homepage&action=click", "text": "Wholesome and nutty in flavor, barley makes a superb alternative to arborio rice when making risotto, since it\u2019s a grain that\u2019s naturally plump and chewy when cooked.

Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.\n\nA pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers \u2014 stovetop and electric \u2014 are quite safe. They don\u2019t explode as your grandmother\u2019s may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.\n\nFor a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, they\u2019re heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the pot\u2019s temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isn\u2019t hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.\n\nWith an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cook\u2019s having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And don\u2019t worry: It won\u2019t explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high."}, {"source": "nytimes", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/50-how-to-make-mac-and-cheese", "text": "The Cheese\n\nThe rule for cooking with wine also applies to cheese: Don\u2019t cook with anything you wouldn\u2019t want to drink or eat on its own. On average, you\u2019ll need a pound and a half to two pounds of cheese per pound of pasta. But the type of cheese can vary depending on the style of macaroni and cheese you are making and your preferred flavors and textures.\n\nCheddar reigns here, somehow always behaving exactly as it should. It melts wonderfully, never breaking or becoming greasy, with just the right amount of salt and tang. Sharp, extra sharp and sharp white are best.\n\nTo bolster flavor, adding a touch of something a bit more assertive like fontina or Gruy\u00e8re is excellent, but be sure that at least half of the cheese used is Cheddar. Fontina and Gruy\u00e8re are richer and fattier and could cause a sauce to break if used on their own. Avoid ultra mild cheeses like Monterey Jack or Colby: While they are fine for melting, they lack the salt or tang to make them worth your while.\n\nA bit of Parmesan or pecorino (up to an additional 1/4 cup grated) can always be added for deeper flavor and saltiness, but too much and the sauce could become grainy.\n\nWhatever cheese you use, it\u2019s always best to grate from a block rather than buying pre-grated cheese (which can contain additives to prevent it from clumping in the bag).\n\nNow, in a perfect world, any cheese worth eating would be a good candidate for your macaroni and cheese, but that\u2019s not the world we live in. There are many factors involved, including fat, salt, protein and water content, that make one cheese more suitable than another. For example, resist the urge to melt your favorite creamy Camembert (too fatty) or salty Gouda (too grainy) into this sauce. They\u2019re much better as a sprinkle here and there.\n\nBeware of too much experimentation, though. If, in adding cheeses, you find your sauce appears broken, you can occasionally remedy it by whisking in more milk (if too thick) or Cheddar (if too runny) while it\u2019s still warm. But unlike, say, mayonnaise, once dairy breaks, it\u2019s often broken for good. It doesn\u2019t mean your sauce is inedible; you may just need to lower your expectations. It\u2019ll still be delicious, but not as creamy."}, {"source": "nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/mark-harris-nc-voter-fraud.html#commentsContainer", "text": "By Mr. Harris\u2019s own account on the stand Thursday, it was his narrow defeat in the 2016 race that set a course toward the board\u2019s decision.

He may feel loyalty to his teammates, who include several other freshmen likely bound for the N.B.A. this year, or to his coaches.

The regulations speak of the need for public confidence in the administration of justice and even have a provision for public release of the attorney general\u2019s report. In a world where Mr. Mueller was the only investigator, the pressure for a comprehensive report to the public would be overwhelming.\n\nThis is where the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d attacks on Mr. Mueller may have backfired. For 19 months, Mr. Trump and his team have had one target to shoot at, and that target has had limited jurisdiction. But now the investigation resembles the architecture of the internet, with many different nodes, and some of those nodes possess potentially unlimited jurisdiction. Their powers and scope go well beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s circumscribed mandate; they go to Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment and whether he lied to the American people. They also include law enforcement investigations having nothing to do with Russia, such as whether the president directed the commission of serious campaign finance crimes, as federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have already stated in filings. These are all critical matters, each with serious factual predicates already uncovered by prosecutors.\n\nHad Mr. Trump and his coterie done nothing wrong, they would have had little to fear from the special counsel, and a report from Mr. Mueller that cleared him would be the gold seal of approval. But Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior, including his dangling of pardons to witnesses in the investigation, makes total exoneration unlikely, even though it is enormously difficult to prosecute crimes with international dimensions and assertions of privilege. The investigation has been further clouded by the fact that people in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle lied repeatedly when it came to Russia (that long list includes Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone).\n\nSure, it is at least possible to envision the special counsel resolving each strand of the investigation and making such information public in detail. But it is also quite possible \u2014 and more likely \u2014 to think that the president\u2019s bashing of Mr. Mueller may induce him to issue a more limited, by-the-book report, which will spawn further investigation. And the bashing may have encouraged Mr. Mueller to turn matters over to other investigators who have not been subject to the same sorts of public attack.\n\nThe House of Representatives has already begun its investigation.

Mr. Jaworski is analogous to Mr. Mueller \u2014 indeed, his appointment was a model for the special counsel regulations. In March 1974, Peter Rodino, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote to Mr. Jaworski, requesting all information he had uncovered in his investigation. Mr. Rodino understood that Mr. Jaworski\u2019s mandate was far more limited than the House\u2019s, and his letter stated that \u201cit would be unthinkable if this material were kept from the House of Representatives in the course of the discharge of its most awesome constitutional responsibility.\u201d"}, {"source": "nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/opinion/keith-tharpe-death-penalty.html#commentsContainer", "text": "Several years after Keith Tharpe was sentenced to death for murder in 1991, a juror in his case signed an affidavit stating that there are two types of black people: good ones and \u201cniggers.\u201d The juror, who was white, put the defendant in the latter category and said that he wondered \u201cif black people even have souls.\u201d\n\nMr. Tharpe sits on death row in Georgia.
