The bulk of our foreign policy decisions and alliances are driven by where nuclear technology is deployed and, in a region as politically unstable as the Middle East, there would be significant geopolitical consequences from a decision that allows Saudi Arabia to make advancements in nuclear technology with the blessing of the U.S. government. This is a decision that warrants as much transparency as possible given what is at stake globally.\n\nCongressional investigators have thus been given specific dates, documents, information and names of White House officials engaged in what the whistleblowers believe problematic activities related to the potential transfer of nuclear technology to Iran. Those documents call into question the interactions and activities of the Trump Administration\u2019s most senior members \u2014 including Jared Kushner, energy secretary Rick Perry, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (who pled guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI), former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland, the inaugural committee chairman Thomas Barrack, and President Trump\u2019s former Deputy Campaign Manager and deputy chairman of the inaugural committee Rick Gates (who has also pled guilty in the Mueller investigation).\n\nIt seems highly irregular to have political figureheads like Barrack play such a hands-on role in high-stakes foreign policy decisions.\n\nThe report reveals that, while serving as the national security advisor during Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, General Michael Flynn advocated for the adoption of a plan \u2014 initiated by a private company called IP3 \u2014 for them to build a nuclear plant in Saudi Arabia. Flynn, though, had simultaneously served as an advisor to an IP3 subsidiary and traveled to Saudi Arabia on behalf of IP3 (a trip he omitted from his security clearance application).\n\nFlynn\u2019s support for the plan would continue throughout the presidential transition and after he joined the White House as the President\u2019s National Security Advisor. Despite warnings about potential criminal conflicts of interest from National Security Council ethics and legal advisors, the White House continued to move forward with Flynn\u2019s plan, even after he\u2019d been forced out over concerns about his contacts with Russian officials and the veracity of his accounts of those contacts with Vice President Pence.\n\nIn a new letter from Chairman Cummings to Acting WH Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, questions are raised regarding a February 12, 2019 White House meeting in which the President reportedly expressed his support for transferring nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia \u2014 a meeting that \u201cwas initiated by IP3 International.\u201d\n\nAnd next week, Kushner \u2014 who, again, is named one of the people problematically involved in the potential transfer of nuclear technology \u2014 is scheduled to embark on a tour of the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia. Kushner, you may recall, offered Saudi\u2019s crown prince advice about how to weather the public relations storm after Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul at the alleged order of the crown prince.\n\nEven more troubling are the potential financial conflicts of interest that Kushner has that pose troubling questions surrounding his motives for being so willing to help the crown prince.\n\nAs the committee\u2019s interim report points out, in January of 2018, Brookfield Business Partners announced plans to acquire Westinghouse Electric, a bankrupt nuclear services company. This company is a key component of IP3\u2019s efforts to build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia. Then, in August of 2018, BBP\u2019s parent company, Brookfield Asset Management, purchased a partnership stake in 666 Fifth Avenue, a building owned by Jared Kushner\u2019s family company. Kushner reportedly divested his interest in this property when he joined his father-in-law\u2019s administration, but his interactions with foreign officials in the Middle East \u2014 particularly as his family looked for a financial backer \u2014 are, at the very least, highly irregular.\n\nAs Congressman Ted Lieu tweeted this week, \u201cWHY DOES JARED KUSHNER STILL HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE?\u201d\n\nThat is, one suspects, a question that House Democrats are quite likely to try and answer \u2014 and they seem to be getting help. For all the media focus on the new Democratic majority\u2019s subpoena powers, the role of whistleblowers within the federal government could become the most important intelligence gathering asset for congressional investigators."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/how-ariana-grande-beat-beatles-55-year-chart-record-thank-ncna974141", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 21, 2019, 7:31 PM GMT By Maura Johnston\n\nComparing any modern-day pop act to The Beatles is a fool's game \u2014 rock purists will sneer at the implication that anyone existing in the modern world could exist alongside The Fab Four, while pop diehards will claim that any attempt to frame the present in the past is a discounting of the modern day. But Ariana Grande's commanding of the top three spots on this week's Hot 100 singles chart, which ties a record set by The Beatles in 1964, does show how music consumption has changed since the days of Beatlemania, with the unison screams of the sixties now echoed in excitable fans' tweets of 2019.\n\nMuch like most of the other records-of-yore that have been broken by streaming-age upstarts, the comparison between what the Beatles and Grande isn't exact. In 1964, when The Beatles achieved their high-water mark of Hot 100 dominance \u2014 at one point, they actually had all of the top five spots on the chart \u2014 the U.S. labels that were able to release their work flooded the market with physical singles that listeners had to buy, in order to push their chart points higher. This was in addition to the full albums of both new and repackaged material that were being released at a fast-enough clip to capitalize on The Beatles' success.\n\nThe Beatles in England in 1964. Michael Ochs Archives / via Getty Images\n\nBack then, in order to make the Hot 100, a song had to be released as a physical single, separate from a longer work. \"Album cuts,\" as they were known, weren't eligible for the big chart until late 1998. In the mid-'90s, zeitgeist-defining songs \u2014 the Rembrandts' bouncy \"Friends\" theme \"I'll Be There for You,\" No Doubt's glittery power ballad \"Don't Speak\" \u2014 didn't cross over to the Hot 100 despite being staples on radio and MTV because their labels hadn't released physical singles, hoping that intrigued listeners would instead buy the full albums to get the songs.\n\nIn December 1998, though, Billboard shifted the chart from a \"singles\" chart to one that just tracked the popularity of songs. This had the effect of turning albums with one or two big hit songs into $18.99 maxi-singles, bought so that listeners could \"own\" that song \u2014 and it, albeit briefly, helped goose the music industry's numbers enough that the Recording Industry Association of America introduced the Diamond Award, given to albums that shipped more than 10 million copies.\n\nOf course, in the years that followed, the introduction of the post-physical music marketplace \u2014 first file-sharing, then digital downloads and finally (at least for now) streaming \u2014 slowed that once seemingly endless growth. The new listening landscape also helped the chart reach its current ability to properly track music-consumption habits: Paid digital download numbers were introduced into the chart's calculus in 2005, streaming data from AOL and Yahoo! arrived two years later, \"on-demand songs\" from Spotify and other services were brought into the mix in 2012 and, in 2013, Billboard began including YouTube plays in their Hot 100 calculus.\n\nFurther tweaks to the formula have happened since then, but the introduction of YouTube is probably the one that's had the most effect on the charts \u2014 and it definitely boosted Grande's standing in the week following the release of her album \"thank u, next.\"\n\nThe album, which officially came out on Feb. 8, already had two popular singles out in the work before its release date: The title track, which came out in November, and the \"My Favorite Things\"-interpolating consumerist ode \"7 Rings,\" which was released in January. Both those tracks make up two-thirds of Grande's current stronghold; the other is the album's final track, the 'NSync-sampling come-on, \"break up with your girlfriend, I'm bored.\"\n\n\"break up\" was the beneficiary not only of its saucy conceit, but that the video for the track, a club fantasia where Grande plays femme fatale, came out on the same day as the album \"thank u, next.\" This strategy of releasing songs in a music-and-video promotional blitz is both made possible by and a beneficiary of the streaming era, when releasing songs to the public and videos to the masses is as easy as uploading a file.\n\nIt was yet another savvy move by Grande, who's proven herself to be one of the artists most capable at keeping up with streaming-era demands of constant curiosity about both her music and her persona. It helps that she's a huge celebrity who's been in the public eye for more than a decade, and her relative youth compared to other female megastars (at 25, she's a year younger than Miley Cyrus) also makes her appealing to radio programmers trying to catch post-millennial ears.\n\n\"thank u, next\" is also a pretty good record \u2014 one that has a bunch of potential radio hits in waiting. (\"Needy,\" which was Grande's fourth-highest-charting \"thank u, next\" song on this week's chart, seems primed to be, umr, next.) Grande's chatty social-media presence, ripe-for-discussion videos and aurally appealing, diaristic pop make her an ideal superstar for the always-on atmosphere of 2019. The increasingly winner-take-all nature of pop in the streaming era, when entire albums can flood the Hot 100 with their individual songs because of rule changes and rabid fanbases, only adds fuel to her dominance."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-attacks-first-amendment-press-gain-ally-supreme-court-ncna973431", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 20, 2019, 4:18 PM GMT By Steve Vladeck, professor at the University of Texas School of Law\n\nAs part of his broader assault on the news media, President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for a revisiting of American libel law \u2014 part of the law of defamation, which governs when individuals can sue those who have allegedly made false statements about them. On Tuesday, he found a powerful ally in Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who penned an opinion encouraging his colleagues to revisit the court\u2019s landmark 1964 ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan.\n\nThe Sullivan case is one of the most important Supreme Court decisions interpreting the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom speech. By encouraging its demise, Thomas is not only proposing to arm Trump with a legal mechanism for going after his critics, he is also arguing that publicly criticizing public figures should come with far more risk. Although no other justice joined in his solo opinion, Thomas\u2019s analysis suggests that Trump\u2019s attacks on the press are resonating in some of the most important chambers of government \u2014 and will only embolden new lawsuits seeking to weaken Sullivan and the critical constitutional principle that it articulated.\n\nAlthough no other justice joined in his solo opinion, Thomas\u2019s analysis suggests that Trump\u2019s attacks on the press are resonating.\n\nThe Sullivan decision came as part-and-parcel of the civil rights movement. On March 29, 1960, civil rights groups took out a full-page \u201ceditorial\u201d advertisement in the New York Times criticizing unnamed authorities in Montgomery, Alabama, for violating the Constitution by abusing protestors and various other actions. L.B. Sullivan, a city commissioner, sued the Times, arguing that the advertisement defamed the reputation of the Montgomery police and included a few minor errors \u2014 such as suggesting that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., had been arrested seven times (as opposed to four). Alabama libel law at the time forced defendants to prove their statements were true, instead of presuming them true. Because the Times couldn\u2019t prove that every statement in the advertisement was true, the jury ruled in Sullivan\u2019s favor, and awarded $500,000 in damages.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nIn a sweeping opinion by Justice William Brennan, Jr., the Supreme Court unanimously reversed this verdict. As Brennan explained, \u201cwe consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d It may also include errors, Brennan explained, because \u201cerroneous statement is inevitable in free debate.\u201d But to allow states to punish all errors in statements about the official conduct of public figures would be antithetical to the purpose of the First Amendment, because \u201c[w]hatever is added to the field of libel is taken from the field of free debate.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Supreme Court believed that the extent to which the First Amendment shielded false speech about public officials was worth it compared to the far greater cost of chilling all Americans, and not just the press, from criticizing their government. This self-censorship was a natural outgrowth of the fear that even factually accurate criticisms could provoke costly litigation.\n\nThat didn\u2019t mean that a public official could never successfully sue for defamation. As Brennan explained, there would be no First Amendment defense if the official could show \u201cactual malice\u201d on the defendant\u2019s part \u2014 \u201cthat is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d But the burden must be on the public official to demonstrate such malice, rather than on the defendant to show good faith.\n\nSullivan set forth a ringing defense of the right to criticize government officials and other public figures, even if it sometimes came at the expense of truth.\n\nIn the process, Sullivan set forth a ringing defense of the right to criticize government officials and other public figures, even if it sometimes came at the expense of truth. And although the decision\u2019s protections were not limited to the press, it was no accident that what followed was far more active \u2014 and skeptical \u2014 press coverage of national events, from civil rights demonstrations to the Vietnam War to Watergate, and beyond. As one media law scholar noted in 2017, Sullivan \u201crecognized that a free press, however imperfect, is the lifeblood of a healthy democracy, one in which journalists are both benefactors and beneficiaries of the First Amendment \u2014 protecting and relying on its freedoms to inform their communities and enable democratic participation.\u201d\n\nThomas\u2019s argument against Sullivan comes in a strange context \u2014 a civil suit against Bill Cosby by one of the women who accused him of sexual assault. The accuser, Kathrine McKee, claimed that Cosby\u2019s attorney had, at Cosby\u2019s behest, written and leaked a letter that defamed her reputation. The lower courts held that her claim could not proceed because McKee was a public figure under Sullivan, and she could not satisfy the \u201cactual malice\u201d standard. Thomas did not dispute the core issue in the case \u2014 whether McKee was properly held to be a public figure. Rather, he wrote to suggest that, in a different case, the court should revisit Sullivan itself, a \u201cpolicy-driven decision[] masquerading as constitutional law.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, 2017. Alex Wong / Getty Images file\n\nAt the core of Thomas\u2019s argument is what he claims to be the original understanding of the First Amendment \u2014 that the law of defamation was almost entirely left to state legislatures and state courts, and the First Amendment did not create any special rules for cases involving public figures. Sullivan itself, though, highlighted the widespread and contemporary consensus that the deeply controversial Sedition Act of 1798 \u2014 which criminalized criticism of the federal government \u2014 was a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nThese critics of the Sedition Act were Founders themselves \u2014 James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, etc. So one can draw a straight line, as Brennan did, from hostility to the Sedition Act to the need for an actual malice standard for defamation against public figures. Thus, although Thomas may be right that \u201cconstitutional opposition to the Sedition Act... does not necessarily support a constitutional actual-malice rule in all civil libel actions brought by public figures,\u201d it does underscore the broader point that the First Amendment protects, and has always protected, a right to criticize the government. Requiring public figures to demonstrate \u201cactual malice\u201d is merely the application of that right in the specific context of defamation law.\n\nTo be clear, no other justice joined in Thomas\u2019s opinion, and none of the current justices have previously expressed similar misgivings about Sullivan. Thus, Sullivan may not be in jeopardy. But it\u2019s impossible to disentangle Thomas\u2019s opinion from the current political moment \u2014 from a president who has repeatedly attacked the media and derided as \u201cfake news\u201d coverage that is accurate but unflattering, has specifically railed against libel laws and has suggested the time is ripe to \u201copen [the laws] up\u201d so that when the press \u201cwrite purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.\u201d\n\nFor a justice who has been on the court for 27 years, it is therefore an especially ominous moment to publicly suggest revisiting Sullivan \u2014 and troubling evidence that Trump\u2019s efforts to weaken public support for our current libel regime, and for the right to criticize the government it enshrines, may well be working. Even at the highest levels of the judiciary."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/police-abused-civil-forfeiture-laws-so-long-supreme-court-stepped-ncna974086", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 21, 2019, 6:08 PM GMT By Scott Lemieux\n\nCivil forfeiture is sometimes a perfectly legitimate practice: Thieves do not have a right to keep the property they\u2019ve stolen, for example. But the state\u2019s power to compel the transfer of property from suspected criminal to the state has become a major tool in the War on [Some Classes of People Who Use Some] Drugs and, as with so much of this war, has become rife with abuse and arbitrary exercises of state power.\n\nThe case of Tyson Timbs is a good example of this abuse with which the system has become rife. Timbs was charged and ultimately convicted of selling a small amount of heroin to an undercover police officer. In addition to a suspended six-year sentence, the state seized Timbs\u2019s $42,000 Land Rover \u2014 even though he could prove that the vehicle was purchased with money received from a life insurance policy and not the proceeds of his low-level criminal enterprise. So while $10,000 is the maximum fine under Indiana Law for the offense of which he was convicted, he was effectively fined much more than that amount when the state seized his car.\n\nThe Supreme Court, though, may have just curtailed the abuse of this practice.\n\nOn Tuesday, in its unanimous ruling in Timbs v. Indiana, the court for the first time held that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201cexcessive fines\u201d also applies to state and local governments. And, even more importantly, the court rejected Indiana\u2019s argument that, even if the excessive fines clause applies to the state, it does not apply to the civil forfeiture of the assets of criminals (or suspected criminals.)\n\nIn her relatively brief opinion for the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg rejected the conclusion of the Indiana Supreme Court that the civil forfeiture was lawful. Ginsburg \u2014 speaking for eight of the court\u2019s nine members \u2014 held that, like the vast majority of the Bill of Rights, the excessive fines clause is a fundamental right that applies to the states under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. And, since the court had already held in a 1993 federal case that civil forfeitures that are even partly punitive are governed by the excessive fines clause, applying the clause to the states made the case easy.\n\nThis decision could be a very big deal: Civil forfeiture is a process rife with abuse and, not surprisingly, studies have found that the practice disproportionately targets people of color. And, because the police generally keep the proceeds of forfeitures, they have a perverse incentive to seize property with little regard for the right of individuals.\n\nPlus, as Sarah Stillman of the New Yorker observed, \u201cyou needn\u2019t be found guilty to have your assets claimed by law enforcement; in some states, suspicion on a par with \u2018probable cause\u2019 is sufficient. Nor must you be charged with a crime, or even be accused of one.\u201d Merely being related to a suspected low-level drug dealer can result in you losing your home, car and/or life savings in some jurisdictions.\n\nThis kind of arbitrary abuse by unelected state officials is exactly the kind of evil the courts should be checking, and the Timbs decision provides a basis for challenging many of these egregious abuses.\n\nHowever, this is a narrow opinion, and how much it will matter will depend on how the court applies it in the future. After all, the Eighth Amendment has applied to federal civil forfeitures for more than two decades and yet, during that period, \u201cthe federal government took in $36.5 billion in assets police seized from people on America\u2019s roads and in its poorer neighborhoods, many of whom never were charged with a crime or shown to have drugs.\u201d And that\u2019s just the federal government.\n\nThe court, then, will need to go further than it has here in order to rein in the abuse of civil forfeiture. It should make it clear that property cannot be taken from people who are merely suspected of crimes or were not materially connected to criminal activity. And it will also need to add some real teeth to the excessive fines clause: If Indiana can evade this ruling by simply raising its maximum fine for low-level drug offenses, the court\u2019s holding will be ineffectual going forward.\n\nStill, Timbs is a good start that suggests the Court will look more skeptically at arbitrary seizures of property. Plus, as the unanimity of today\u2019s ruling indicates, it\u2019s an increasingly rare issue in which liberals and conservatives should be able to find common ground."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/female-digital-assistants-alexa-siri-remain-popular-silicon-valley-it-ncna973296", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 20, 2019, 7:09 PM GMT By Lynn Stuart Parramore\n\nSummon her with a tap or a word.

Kilimnik was charged with obstruction of justice in June of 2018 for helping Manafort attempt to tamper with witnesses. The polling data in question was likely used by the Russians on social media to micro-target potential Hillary Clinton voters in an effort to suppress their votes during the 2016 presidential election. Second, Manafort lied about the Ukraine peace plan that he and Kilimnik had discussed in August 2016. This so-called peace plan included the dropping of U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea. The lifting of sanctions appears to be part of a qui pro quo plan involving Russian election meddling and the staged release of the emails and documents stolen from the Democratic National Committee.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nThe possibility of Manafort really cooperating after being hammered with a huge sentence has been hardly mentioned in the press. This failure to recognize what might happen next with Manafort is premised on the faulty assumption that Manafort\u2019s long trail of lies and duplicitous dealings with the government nullifies his ability to be an effective witness. In my experience as a prosecutor, however, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nFirst, under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Manafort has up to one year after the date of his sentencing to ask the court for a reduction of sentence based on cooperation. Thus, under the law it is not too late for him to cooperate. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, will likely be taking advantage of this same rule in an effort to reduce his three-year sentence.\n\nSecond, the government frequently presents witnesses to juries who have unsavory backgrounds. Lying and cheating does not help a witness\u2019s credibility, obviously, but it does not mean the witness will not be believed in the courtroom. Remember, Mueller\u2019s current contingent of witnesses have similar baggage: Michael Flynn, the former national security advisor, lied to the FBI; Michael Cohen has admitted to lying to banks and government agencies \u2014 including Congress and Mueller\u2019s office\u2014 under the guise of cooperating. Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s deputy during the presidential campaign, also lied to banks and government agencies including Mueller\u2019s office when he was supposedly cooperating.\n\nAs a prosecutor, I regularly obtained convictions with witnesses with worst criminal backgrounds than any of these individuals.\n\nAs a prosecutor, I regularly obtained convictions with witnesses with worst criminal backgrounds than any of these individuals. I presented witnesses to juries who were not only liars and cheats but in some cases were murderers. Their past crimes, however, did not preclude them from being effective witnesses and ultimately telling the truth. The closeness of their relationships to the criminals they testified against made them insiders, with unique access and knowledge. They had already breached the secrecy of tight-knit criminal organizations and were able to describe in detail to juries the inner workings of those organizations\n\nIn this case, many of Mueller\u2019s witnesses \u2014 including Manafort \u2014 held positions of trust with Donald Trump and had access to and conversations with the president at periods of high interest for Mueller\u2019s team.\n\nJuries convict people based on this type of accomplice testimony because the government is able to provide independent evidence corroborating what the witness says \u2014 whether through documents, tape recordings or other witnesses. The key is presenting enough corroborating evidence that a jury can convict without relying solely on the word of the accomplice witness. There is no doubt that much of this corroborating evidence exists, because the judge in Manafort\u2019s case has already found sufficient evidence that he lied about two highly material matters to the Russian investigation. At a minimum, we can safely assume that Robert Gates can also corroborate a great deal of Manafort testimony.\n\nNever underestimate the power of a lifetime behind bars to convince a criminal to reevaluate his relationship with prosecutors."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-campaign-will-face-scrutiny-clinton-got-ncna973136", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 20, 2019, 9:35 AM GMT By Zac Petkanas, president, Petkanas Strategies LLC and a former senior aide to Hillary Clinton\n\nThe ultimate problem that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., faces right now, after announcing his intention to again seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president, is that Democratic voters aren\u2019t fully aware of his record \u2014 yet.\n\nThat may seem counterintuitive after the rough 2016 primary and his supporters' blanketing of social media. But, in truth, the 2016 Clinton campaign never named him in a single negative television or digital ad. And the media never truly educated the primary voting public with the intensity reserved for candidates seen as viable: His underdog status protected him then, but he won\u2019t have that this time around.\n\nThere were, of course, numerous news stories that covered Sanders\u2019 positions throughout the campaign, in between the obsessive coverage detailing the gritty ins and outs of the latest in the Clinton email scandal. A study from Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy suggests as much: Only seven percent of his coverage was about his policies, but 83 percent of that was positive, whereas 28 percent of Clinton's coverage was policy-based and 84 percent of that was negative.\n\n\"Journalists,\" the study said \"made more references to her past history than they did to those of other candidates and focused on the negative.\"\n\nThey did not do the same with Sanders\u2019 gun safety record or his reluctance, until recently, to embrace marriage equality.\n\nIf Sanders\u2019 team of consultants gave him some honest advice about what the 2020 election will be like, they\u2019ll have told him it will be much harder than his experience in 2016 \u2014 both because he won't be facing Clinton, and because the differences between his policies and those of others in the field won't be as distinct.\n\nSo, while in 2016 he cultivated a reputation around popular left-wing positions like Medicare-for-All and free college, the broader embrace of those issues in the Democratic party means that his opponents in a second presidential campaign will inevitably address his lesser-known and decidedly less progressive record on the issues that cut directly against his liberal brand.\n\nFor example, many Democratic voters may now be surprised to learn that Sanders opposed a staggering number of gun safety measures throughout his career. He voted five times against the Brady Bill, a common-sense measure mandating a waiting period and background check before purchasing firearms. Rather than apologize, his 2016 campaign doubled down: His top aide, Jeff Weaver, characterized the Brady Bill, in Politifact\u2019s words, a \"federal overreach.\"\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t silence the criticism, the Sanders team pointed to the senator\u2019s support for a substitute amendment implementing \u201cinstant\u201d background checks instead. What they didn\u2019t say was that the National Rifle Association actually backed that amendment as a sneaky way to neuter the larger bill; technology didn\u2019t exist in the early 1990s to perform the \u201cinstant\" checks the amendment demanded.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019 gun votes don\u2019t end there: He voted to allow firearms on Amtrak trains; he voted to create what is now called \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d that allowed Dylann Roof to obtain the weapon used to murder nine African-Americans in a Charleston church in June 2015. He even voted repeatedly against holding gun manufacturers liable for the destruction caused by their products, which was strange because he supported similar consumer protection measures for other industries, like food manufacturers.\n\nStill, he felt so strongly about protecting the gun industry from lawsuits that he actually defended his votes on the campaign trail before being forced to flip flop.\n\nDemocratic voters who listened to his relentless attacks on Clinton (who wasn\u2019t even in Congress at the time) over the 1994 Crime Bill \u2014 which was partially responsible for the mass incarceration crisis facing our country \u2014 might also be shocked to learn that Sanders voted for it. The excuses for his vote were pathetic: His supporters pointed to the fact that he gave a strongly-worded speech condemning aspects of the bill before casting a vote in favor of it.\n\nThis team also claimed that he gave his support because it included other provisions that he liked, an explanation that is undermined every time he cites smaller objections as a reason to vote against other large pieces of legislation \u2014 like when he voted to tank Sen. Ted Kennedy\u2019s comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2007 by citing the inclusion of a guest worker program.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, he claimed to oppose the included guest worker program because it was akin to \u201cslavery.\u201d But in a video of Sanders, later revealed, trashing the legislation on anti-immigrant Lou Dobbs\u2019 TV show, he never likened the guest worker program to slavery. Nor did he make that argument when he voted for a similar program in 2013. Instead he made a nativist argument about how the legislation would reduce wages for Americans by bringing in low-wage temporary workers.\n\nBut there\u2019s more that Democratic primary voters won\u2019t like.\n\nHe will have to explain his wishy-washy past on same sex marriage: Until 2009, he said it was a matter for the states to decide, and even told a reporter in 2006 that Vermont should not pursue it at all.\n\nAnd he\u2019ll need a better explanation, post-#MeToo, for his disturbing 70s-era essay about rape fantasies and what it means about his attitude towards women. (That is especially true in light of the allegations of sexual harassment at his campaign offices, the resulting $30,000 settlement and his initial cavalier response that he was too \u201cbusy\u201d to intervene in the culture of misconduct at his operation.)\n\nNor will he be able tell his critics to lay off their critiques for the sake of unity, especially given that his supporters are already in full-blown attack mode tearing down other candidates.\n\nIt's clear that the Democratic Party should be grateful that Sanders helped move the conversation to the left on issues like health care and education during the 2016 primary and in the years since. However, it is difficult to see how he surmounts his more conservative record on other key issues when there are so many progressive candidates to choose from who are espousing similar policies \u2014 and when Hillary Clinton is not on the ballot to kick around."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cory-booker-wants-be-nicest-democrat-running-president-his-own-ncna966596", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 11, 2019, 9:16 PM GMT By Anthea Butler\n\nSenator Cory Booker has been auditioning for president ever since he shoveled snow off of a sidewalk in 2010 as the mayor of Newark, N.J., causing a twitter sensation. Can his nice guy act win him the Democratic nomination for president?\n\nIn a normal election cycle, maybe. But not in 2020.\n\nHowever, if he doesn't win the nomination, it won't be because of Kamala Harris or Beto O'Rourke \u2014 but it might be because of a guy named T-Bone.\n\nWhen Booker was recounting his years in Newark, often while running for office, he used to tell people a story about a person named T-Bone, a drug dealer who had once menaced him but later came seeking his help to stay out of prison only to then recount (and cry about) his difficult childhood. T-Bone could never be found \u2014 and everyone from political supporters to the National Review tried. In 2013, when confronted about it by a Washington Post reporter, Booker went on to tell a long- winded story about how the media is quite unfair.\n\nBooker\u2019s problem in this 2020 presidential race is going to be about his sincerity and authenticity \u2014 or how much of his \"nice guy\" shtick is a political act. And every criticism will come back around to that, one way or another.\n\nBooker\u2019s campaign launch video leaned all the way into his personal qualities, invoking both a religious feeling and a civil rights movement vibe. And the night before his announcement, he was prayed for by his pastor and the congregation of his church, Metropolitan Baptist church.\n\nBy the afternoon after the release of his video, he was denying the one thing that Democrats want to hear from their candidates: That the president is racist, and we have a problem with race in our nation.\n\nIn his comments to the press after his presidential announcement, Booker could not state openly that President Trump is a racist, opting to criticize him for \u201cbigoted language.\u201d (Other Democratic hopefuls have been more forthright: Sherrod Brown said Trump was a racist; Kamala Harris spoke about Trump and his racist policies; and even Bernie Sanders said Trump is a racist.) Booker, when pressed, said, of the president, \u201cI don\u2019t know the heart of anybody. I\u2019ll leave that to the Lord\u201d.\n\nWhile the Lord deliberates, though, Booker obfuscates. Democrats in 2020 want to win the presidency, not a popularity contest.\n\nBooker, to date, has been relying on the language of love and a youthful preacher\u2019s cadence to win over Democratic supporters. It can be no coincidence that the drumbeat in Booker\u2019s campaign launch video evokes one of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous speeches, \u201cThe Drum Major Instinct,\" in which King compares the desire of people to \"achieve distinction\" with the desire to serve others, love and fight for justice. King warns that the urge to be recognized, if not used in service of others, \"causes one\u2019s personality to become distorted\" and can lead to \"trying to deal with your ego problem by boasting.\"\n\nPerhaps even about T-Bone.\n\nBooker is known for soaring words such as his speech at the Democratic national convention in 2016, yet, he can also be pointed and critical when it comes to his political opponents. His verbal dressing down of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen, for instance, over Trump's comments about \"shithole countries\" was hailed by the Democrats, and derided by Republicans. When he flouted the rules during the Kavanaugh hearing by releasing protected information was welcome by some, and grandstanding by other,\n\nBoth supporters and detractors have talked about Booker's penchant for \"performative\" language. David Axelrod remarked \u2014 about Booker's delivery after hosting him at the Institute for Politics at the University of Chicago \u2014 that the senator's \"flair for the dramatic\" can go a bit too far. Megan McCain questioned Booker directly on \"The View\" about his \"I am Spartacus\"comment at the Kavanaugh hearings, and he responded, \"You can't speak to authenticity. You just have to be who you are.\"\n\nBooker's authenticity, though, is also regularly questioned by liberals who note that, despite living in a low-income neighborhood for the past 20 years, but his political career required the assistance of powerful rich friends. Booker took the most contributions from people employed by Wall Street for his 2014 campaign, beating out Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Another huge portion of his campaign donations come from the pharmaceutical industry, to the tune of $330,000 in 2014 alone (barely under McConnell's haul), particularly because New Jersey is the home to many pharmaceutical firms. In 2017, Booker put a pause on receiving these funds, but he'll have that history to overcome with Democratic voters at a time when drug prices are skyrocketing.\n\nFor voters, Booker's Wall Street ties and his T-Bone stories are part of the same problem: Authenticity. Can you be a liberal Democratic willing to take on billionaires, entrenched corporations and the deregulation unleashed by the Trump Administration after years of cozying up to Wall Street and pharmaceutical donors? Can you address the racial divides in America \u2014 not just what's in people's hearts, but the problems of differential education, mass incarceration and inequality of opportunity \u2014 if you can't bring yourself to call Trump a racist? And can you be trusted to tell the truth of why you've arrived at your liberal politics if you made up a T-Bone to explain to white people a cartoon version of black intergenerational trauma?\n\nMaybe he can. But, in 2020, maybe he shouldn't."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/kamala-harris-candidacy-requires-nuanced-debate-about-her-record-race-ncna961301", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nJan. 22, 2019, 6:02 PM GMT By Jill Filipovic, Author, \"The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness\"\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, the second-ever black woman to serve in the senate, is running for president \u2014 and, while her prior prosecutorial career is peppered with groundbreaking moments, it\u2019s also turning into her greatest liability as people across the ideological spectrum are increasingly questioning America\u2019s punitive criminal justice system.\n\nBecause Harris is a woman of color running for a position that has been exclusively male (and nearly exclusively white) for its entire history, it can be difficult to parse where she is rightly being held accountable for the damaging choices she made as first a prosecutor and then as California\u2019s attorney general, and where she\u2019s being held to a higher standard and picked apart in ways white men have not been.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to look at her political career in two interrelated contexts. Ambitious women routinely run into the tough-but-likeable conundrum, needing to be seen as both hyper-competent and inevitably agreeable even though, for women, those qualities are usually considered mutually exclusive. This is even more complicated for black women, who are stereotyped as angry, aggressive and anti-white \u2014 Michelle Obama, of all people, was often painted as a rage-filled militant by right-wing media despite her inarguably funny, gentle and (frankly) mom-like public disposition. Black women also have to further demonstrate that they are rational instead unreasonable; rationality is simply presumed of white men, unless proven otherwise (and often even after there\u2019s ample evidence to the contrary).\n\nAnd so Harris\u2019s candidacy\u2014 more than that of any other candidate in the field right now \u2014 demands difficult and thoughtful conversations on both criminal justice policy and race and gender. These conversations require moving beyond simplistic taglines like \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d or \u201cKamala is a cop.\u201d Unfortunately, a temperate and thoughtful parsing seems unlikely from a left still engaging in proxy wars for 2016\u2019s Hillary Clinton v. Bernie Sanders primary.\n\nIn a devastating piece in the New York Times, law professor Lara Bazelon detailed the many ways in which Harris\u2019s positioning of herself as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d is a generous rewrite of her own history. As San Francisco district attorney, Harris\u2019s office often took aggressive stances on upholding convictions, even where there was evidence tampering or suppression, which may have kept wrongly-convicted people in jail for decades. She defended the state\u2019s death penalty law, even as she said she personally opposed it \u2013 possibly because, early in her career, she came under attack for declining to pursue the death penalty for a man who killed a police officer.\n\nAnd, when Californians were voting to reform their punitive Three Strikes law, Harris didn\u2019t take a position, citing a conflict of interest \u2014 a move many advocates of reform saw as cowardly. She defended the Department of Corrections when they refused to provide gender confirmation surgery to transgender inmates, a policy with which Harris said she personally disagreed and tried to change behind the scenes, but that, as attorney general, she was obligated to represent before the courts.\n\nBut Harris also started a program that sent young people convicted of low-level offenses to apprenticeship and job training programs rather than jail. She spearheaded a statewide implicit bias and procedural justice training in an effort to make law enforcement fairer. She often did decline to pursue harsh sentences. She made statistics on police shootings available to the public.\n\nAll of her decisions, good and bad, are worth discussing and debating. For many on the left, Harris\u2019s decisions as a prosecutor are disqualifying in a Democratic primary.\n\nBut it\u2019s also the case, less often discussed, that Harris was balancing demands and expectations that are not put quite so squarely on the shoulders of white men. As \"a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty\u201d (her words), she faced significant hostility in her job and during her campaigns from police unions and the law-and-order types in her state, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Harris is now criticized for being too deferential to existing authority in her work. That may be true \u2014 but it may also be true that she simply had less space to be unrestrained.\n\nBecause there have been so few women generally, and women of color specifically, in positions of high-level political power in the United States, it becomes easier to caricature them or flatten their records into simplistic positions rather than taking into account the nuances of policy. White men, on the other hand, get to be complicated, have imperfect records, and be treated like individuals.\n\nFor instance, in 2016, Hillary Clinton took significant heat from the left for speaking in favor of the punitive 1994 crime bill as First Lady: Even though she had no power to actually vote for the bill, it dogged her campaign anyway. Her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, however actually did vote for the crime bill, but largely escaped criticism for his vote because, well, it was \u201ccomplicated.\u201d And that\u2019s true: It was complicated.\n\nSanders said at the time the bill was being considered that the country\u2019s priorities were misplaced and more attention should be paid to jobs and education than punitive punishments. He said during the 2016 primary that he nonetheless voted for it because there were other provisions, like the Violence Against Women Act and assault weapons ban, that he thought were important. But before his presidential run, he'd also bragged about voting for the bill as evidence of his \u201ctough on crime\u201d stance. All of his explanations have been largely accepted.\n\nFemale candidates are often not extended this same benefit of the doubt, let alone the understanding that sometimes, politicians compromise or make mistakes. However, being both human and politicians, they are guaranteed to have made decisions that are craven or simply wrong-headed, as have their male counterparts. The question, particular for those on the left, is how to hold politicians accountable for the choices they made that did significant harm without falling into the trap of giving more credence and understanding to white men\u2019s decisions, and not understanding the particular demands facing women and people of color in politics.\n\nConversations around Harris have to both offer a critical but fair reading of her time as a prosecutor \u2014 when she led offices that did significant damage to vulnerable people \u2014 while also allowing for a nuanced conversation on the many ways race and gender still shape both political opportunities and perceptions.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t means that liberals are required to support Harris or whitewash her record, and indeed a reasonable and responsible debate about her candidacy requires asking tough questions about the choices she made. But a reasonable and responsible debate also requires asking tough questions of the men whose choices we have long let slide, and understanding that one\u2019s race and gender continue to impose outside limits on what one is able to do without consequence.\n\nThat\u2019s a more difficult and measured conversation than edgy hashtags allow. But if we don\u2019t want 2020 to be a repeat of 2016, it\u2019s a necessary one."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/democrats-running-president-2020-must-stop-equating-hard-work-morality-ncna964266", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nJan. 29, 2019, 11:00 PM GMT By Miles Howard\n\nLabor is having a moment on the 2020 campaign trail, but not in the way one might hope for.\n\nIt began when Sen. Elizabeth Warren essentially kicked off the Democratic primary in December by releasing a rousing 2020 campaign video that hinted at wealth redistribution while rhapsodizing about the virtue of a hard day\u2019s work. As the video begins, Warren declares that, \u201cIn our country, if you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to take care of yourself and the people you love. That\u2019s the fundamental promise of America.\u201d\n\nSince Warren officially announced her candidacy, several other Democrats have thrown their hats in the ring as well. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown took Warren\u2019s \u201cwork hard, live a good life\u201d sentiment to a new level by announcing that he will explore a 2020 bid by embarking on a \u201cDignity of Work\u201d tour of crucial battleground states like Iowa and South Carolina. In a press release, Brown argued that, \u201cDignity of work means hard work should pay off for everyone... When work has dignity, everyone can afford health care, education, and housing.\u201d\n\nIf this line sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it belongs to a rhetorical tradition of the campaign trail, in which politicians of both parties celebrate hard work as the essence of what it means to be an American. It\u2019s a safe bet that every 2020 contender \u2014 even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 will echo some variation of this idea.\n\nThe logic here is that the American people once enjoyed prosperity by virtue of their work. This is basically a 21st-century rekindling of the concept of the Protestant work ethic \u2014 which stipulates that a person is defined (or redeemed) by the quality of their labor. In other words, as long as you are chipping away at some endeavor, then you deserve to be afforded the basic cornerstones of a comfortable life.\n\nWhen Democrats like Warren and Brown preach the gospel of working hard, the rhetoric is most likely meant to be both encouraging and nostalgic \u2014 an ode to the famous American work ethic, and a memento to the \u201cgood old days\u201d when a (white) middle-class worker could feed themselves and their family.\n\nBut the subtle ideology of hard work is actually quite insidious, not to mention patronizing. Framing hard work as the prerequisite for comfort and security encourages voters to sympathize with the wealthiest class (who, logically, must be the hardest of all workers) and to look down on the less fortunate, such as the 30 percent of American families who now have more debt than savings or the growing number of Americans who are exiting the workforce because they can\u2019t find work.\n\nFraming hard work as the prerequisite for comfort and security encourages voters to sympathize with the wealthiest class.\n\nWorking hard is idealized as a kind of self-fulfilling dignity \u2014 which suggests that anything less is something to be ashamed of. Can\u2019t pay your rent or afford your pills? You need to work harder. Mental or physical illness keeping you from holding down a steady job? You are less deserving of the American Dream.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that Democrats unwittingly propagate the notion that hard work is dignity, which better compliments the Republican Party\u2019s dog-eat-dog capitalist worldview. This idea glosses over the human brutality of hard work, which can break bodies, families and communities. And worse, the myth that hard work is virtuous compromises the Democratic Party\u2019s credibility as a party that cares about inequality. Arguing that people should have new economic rights on the condition that they work hard sends a confusing message about what the Democrats ultimately stand for.\n\nPeople, or productivity?\n\nSpeaking as a journalist who has written about the gulf between the myth of hard work and the reality of how people feel about the \u201cdignity\u201d of labor \u2014 especially millennials, who inherited an economy with poor labor protections and stagnant wages, and are becoming understandably disenchanted with capitalism \u2014 I\u2019d like to pose a challenge to all the Democrats who plan on running in 2020.\n\nHave the courage to say that every American deserves basic economic security. Period.\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s 2020 video actually foreshadows a rhetorical change like this. Warren at least concedes that the \u201crules\u201d of economic mobility in America primarily benefit white families and that minorities who work hard reap far fewer rewards because of structural racism. This is kind of a \u201cthought warmup\u201d for voters who aren\u2019t yet ready to consider that hard work doesn\u2019t \ufffcbestow dignity upon everyone, and that every person\u2019s rights to housing, health care, and an education should be independent of what they do for a living, or whether they even work at all.\n\nSome will deride this new framing as a slippery slope toward socialism. But it could also electrify voters who\u2019ve experienced burnout from the crush of long hours, meager paychecks, debt collection notices. It could offer hope that one day, we might not have to give so much of our time and lifeblood to our employers to be afforded the necessities of survival and happiness.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we learned in the 2018 midterms, it\u2019s this that voters respond strongly when they feel belatedly recognized by politicians. The victories of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, who spoke to routinely ignored voters of color and millennials, demonstrated the power of talking openly about structural poverty and how it deprives people of their right to a decent life. Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described Democratic Socialist, took things even further and said that in America, no person should \u201cbe too poor to live.\u201d\n\nGuess which demographics boosted Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley to victory? Millennials and voters of color.\n\nThe 2020 election is heating up at a moment when much is changing in American politics. Today there are more women and people of color holding public office than ever before. Lofty ideas like Medicare For All and a Green New Deal are now being pursued. The timing is perfect for turning the page on this notion that only people who work hard should be considered true Americans \u2014 and that work is inherently moral.\n\nSure, in the short term, this might mean alienating old-fashioned voters who say stuff like, \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch\u201d \u2014 but frankly, that\u2019s a loss that the Democratic Party can afford. Because the party would stand to gain scores of voters (most of them young people) who\u2019ve yet to taste the tough-won prosperity that politicians reflexively gush about. Few things would be more seismic or cathartic than hearing a presidential contender acknowledge that hard work isn\u2019t everything, and that some things are more important.

But Trump has presumably destroyed the attraction of a bringing in a businessman to run government.\n\nAnd Schultz\u2019s initial flirtation raises questions about whether he\u2019s ready for prime time: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk in the hypothetical about what I would do if I was president,\u201d he said on CNBC Monday when asked about possibly raising corporate tax rates. Seriously? He doesn\u2019t want to speak hypothetically about what he would do if he won the office for which he is considering running? (Never mind that he had no problem answering other policy questions, making his \u201chypothetical\u201d dodge even weaker.)\n\nAt a time of almost blinding polarization, a national outcry for (excuse the pun) lukewarm coffee hardly seems likely. \u201cAny calls for centrism are larger than the electoral space for centrism,\u201d Nathan Gonzales, editor of Inside Elections, told me. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure that there\u2019s enough space for a moderate candidate to win enough votes.\u201d\n\nA cursory knowledge of U.S. history, too, indicates that third party candidates are the longest shots to win: George Wallace was the last to win any states more than a half-century ago.\n\nNevertheless, Schultz\u2019s bank account alone suggests 3.4 billion reasons why he should be taken seriously. And there are at least a couple of reasons why the prospect of an independent Schultz bid worries Democrats and should cheer the besieged Trump.\n\nThe first is his potential to play spoiler. \u201cDefinitely if there\u2019s an independent in the race, particularly one with Mr. Schultz\u2019s background, who\u2019s a Democrat, I would expect that he will draw from whoever the Democratic nominee is going to be and ultimately help Mr. Trump get re-elected,\u201d former Rep. Mike Michaud, a Democrat of Maine, said to me.\n\nHe knows of what he speaks: Michaud was the Democrats\u2019 2014 gubernatorial nominee in the Pine Tree State, running against a polarizing, deeply unpopular incumbent, Gov. Paul LePage. Dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s craziest governor\u201d by Politico, LePage seemed the least likely politician to win re-election that year \u2013 and yet he prevailed. That win came, at least in part, because of independent Eliot Cutler, a former Carter administration official who ran as an independent. Cutler tallied more than 50,000 votes in a race LePage won by about slightly less than 30,000. \u201cIt definitely made the difference,\u201d Michaud says.\n\nIt is an admittedly rough parallel: Maine has a deep tradition of independent candidates \u2014 one of its current senators is Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats \u2014 and does not have anything like the Electoral College. But it serves as a cautionary tale of how a strong third party can help rescue a beleaguered incumbent.\n\n\u201cI have seen enough data over many years to know that anyone running for POTUS as an independent will split the anti-incumbent, anti-Trump vote,\u201d tweeted Howard Wolfson, an adviser to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who pondered an independent bid in 2016. Bloomberg is now contemplating a run as a Democrat because, as he himself tweeted, \u201cin 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.\u201d\n\nTrump himself gets this, taunting Schultz on Twitter that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the \u2018guts\u2019 to run for President!\u201d Why elevate Schultz like that? \u201cTrump told the crowd at the Trump Hotel [Monday night] fundraiser that he was trying to get Howard Schultz into the race with his tweet earlier today because he thinks he'll help him, per attendee,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman tweeted.\n\nThis does not mean Schultz (or former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who is reportedly mulling an independent bid) would automatically be a game-changer: Neither John Anderson in 1980 nor Ross Perot in 1992 materially affected the outcome of those races, despite achieving nontrivial vote shares. (That Perot was a Clinton-electing spoiler in 1992 is accepted wisdom among some on the right but, as MSNBC\u2019s Steve Kornacki has ably demonstrated, it\u2019s a myth.)\n\nStill, national Democrats are still feeling the sting of Jill Stein\u2019s vote totals being larger than the Trump-Hillary Clinton margins in three key states (Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania) in 2016, as well as Ralph Nader getting more than the George W. Bush-Al Gore margins in Florida and New Hampshire in 2000.\n\nThat history precisely illuminates the problem Trump faces: The last two non-incumbent Republicans to win the White House needed a third-party nudge to help them over the finish line. Ordinary presidents, even ones who didn\u2019t have to rely on the Electoral College for their victories, enter office seeking to expand their coalitions and increase their popularity. Not so Trump, who seems content that his 2016 victory, which relied on a roughly 80,000 vote edge in three swing states while losing the popular vote badly, is a reliable model for 2020.\n\nAnd not only has he put in zero effort to expand his base, he responded to a 2018 electoral whipping that should have been a blaring alarm \u2014 including Democrats picking up governorships in Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 with a shutdown over immigration, an issue which drives moderate and suburban voters from him.\n\nBut beyond dividing the electorate so that Trump could conquer, a Schultz candidacy poses a subtler but still pernicious threat to Democrats: He could normalize our radical president.\n\nFundamental to a Schultz candidacy is the assumption that the two parties are equally to blame for our national problems. \u201cWe have a broken political system with both parties basically in business to preserve their own ideology without a recognition and responsibility to represent the interests of the American people,\u201d Schultz told The New York Times.\n\nThat is nonsense. Trump is not merely a conventional Republican afflicted with an acute case of political Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. While a bungler, he nonetheless has authoritarian impulses that threaten genuine harm to our country: He attacks the free press and independent judiciary; he countenances violence and racial strife; and he undermines long-standing international alliances while praising authoritarians, especially Vladimir Putin (who seems to hold a special place in the president\u2019s heart). And that list doesn\u2019t include his potentially using emergency powers to override the constitution and cut Congress out of the national policy-making process.\n\nBut in Howard Schultz\u2019 view, Trump is apparently no worse than whomever the might Democrats nominate. And since we\u2019ve already elected one delusional person to the highest office in the land, it\u2019s unclear why Schultz would be any better than Trump."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/joe-biden-democrats-best-chance-beat-trump-2020-no-other-ncna961836", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nJan. 24, 2019, 8:30 PM GMT By Ashley Pratte\n\nIf liberals, independents and former Republicans agree on any one thing \u2014 and there are very few things about which anyone can seemingly agree these days \u2014 it is that finding a Democratic nominee who can beat Donald Trump in 2020 is of paramount importance.\n\nAnd, if we learned anything from 2016, that nominee will need to transcend party politics and appeal to moderate voters, swing voters and independent voters (like me) who no longer have a political affiliation after that dumpster fire of an election.\n\nThat is why Joe Biden is arguably the party's best hope for 2020. As the most established, qualified, experienced, likable, popular and bipartisan Democrat exploring a bid for the presidency, his ability to relate to blue-collar Americans and his jovial demeanor make him the ideal candidate to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to Biden\u2019s likability, he soars among almost every demographic and is more favorable than Donald Trump (56 percent unfavorable and 40 percent favorable). However, Biden also sits atop all the potential 2020 candidates as the only candidate with a favorability over 50 percent, according to late December Quinnipiac polling.\n\nBiden has a track record of working across the aisle to get things done. Biden was the guy who negotiated the fiscal cliff deal with Senator Mitch McConnell as well as a major part of the 2010 deal that extended the Bush tax cuts, because he doesn\u2019t view Republicans as enemies, he knows he needs to work with them in order to get things done. This is exactly the right tone that needs to be set on the campaign trail especially as Republican voters in general and Trump supporters in particular feel vilified by the media.\n\nJust this week, he responded to criticism of himself in the New York Times for being bipartisan saying, \u201cI read in the New York Times today that one of my problems if I were to run for president, I like Republicans. OK, well bless me father for I have sinned.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFrom where I come from, I don\u2019t know how you get anything done. I don\u2019t know how you get anything done unless you start talking to one another again.\u201d\n\nThe eventual Democratic nominee would also have to appeal to young voters, who have been the most disaffected by Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 and Biden polls best among voters under the age of 35 with a 60 percent favorability. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that upon Biden\u2019s return to the social platform Instagram late last summer, he drew over one million followers \u2014 and we all know social media is key to reaching young people in today\u2019s campaign atmosphere.\n\nWhichever Democrat candidate becomes the nominee will also need to have a name recognition that matches that of Trump, and Biden can handily compete with that as the former vice president of the United States and a long time senator.\n\nFurthermore, there are two key demographics that swung for Trump in the 2016 election that Democrats need to win back in 2020: Independent voters and most importantly, suburban female voters. In the 2016 election, over 47 percent of Trump\u2019s voters were women \u2014 a statistic that still shocks many pundits and analysts to this day. But due to the rhetoric and blunders of the White House, nearly 30 percent of those women now have a very poor impression of Trump according to a recent Pew Research Poll.\n\nWorse than just their sentiments toward Trump, though, suburban women who catapulted him into the White House swung blue in the midterm elections. A USA Today analysis of the 2018 midterm election found more than 80 suburban counties and cities \u2014 with high incomes and large number of college-educated voters \u2014 voted more Democratic than in 2016. These gains were huge for Democrats, but this demographic could change again in 2020 if Republicans were to get smart about their candidates, rhetoric, and strategy, which no one expects.\n\nThese suburban and college-educated women who are increasingly aligning themselves with the Democratic party also describe themselves as mostly moderates \u2014 looking for a government that compromises.\n\nAnd, suburban swing voters were the ones who were fed up with career politicians and willing to shake things up \u2014 but have been left shocked by how Trump has conducted himself in the Oval Office. These same voters who wanted to try doing away with business as usual are now looking for stability.\n\nAnd, while the hyper-liberal wing of the Democratic party is already making noise about Biden's work reaching across the aisle to help common-sense Republicans and even seizing on his questioning of Anita Hill nearly 30 years ago despite his apology, voters are not going to ignore his long history of leadership on the issues of domestic violence and sexual assault as the writer and champion of the Violence Against Women Act in 1990. But, his work on the issue didn\u2019t stop there: When he served as vice president he worked with college campuses to address the issue and even after leaving office penned an op-ed on changing the culture around sexual assault.\n\nTo put it bluntly, Biden has everything he needs to run against Trump and actually win \u2014 he just needs to officially throw his hat in the ring and convince others in the field to move aside so as to not fall victim to a tough primary the likes of which the Republican Party saw in 2008, 2012 and 2016. All the resources of the Democratic party ought to go toward defeating Trump, not fighting one another.\n\nAs a former Republican voter who denounced the party once Trump became its nominee, I\u2019ve often been asked who my ideal candidate would be, and the answer has always been rather simple: A ticket with Joe Biden at the top, because he is a no-nonsense guy who understands the needs of everyday Americans and knows how to make the government work for the people.\n\nNot only does Biden\u2019s likability and down-to-earth personality make him the ideal candidate, he is the right candidate for the moment \u2014 and that moment is a dire one. It\u2019s time to return common sense, bipartisanship and stability back to our government and to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in particular.\n\nRather than crowding the field, Democrats should encourage someone like Biden to run if they\u2019re serious about taking back the White House, or they will simply tear themselves apart and hand the election to Trump on a platter."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/elizabeth-warren-hillary-clinton-sexist-hypocrisy-likability-media-narrative-here-ncna955021", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nJan. 5, 2019, 10:07 AM GMT By Ashton Pittman\n\nThe same day Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced plans to seek the 2020 Democratic nomination, the sexist media narratives of elections gone by staged a comeback in the form of a Politico article highlighting concerns that Warren may share too many \u201cattributes\u201d with Hillary Clinton to be \u201clikable.\u201d\n\nFor 2016 supporters of Clinton \u2014 who has often been described as \u201cdisconnected,\u201d \u201cflawed,\u201d \u201cpolarizing,\u201d and \u201cunlikable\u201d\u2014 the adjectives Politico ascribed to Warren sounded awfully familiar.\n\nAnd yet, things were different just two years ago. While Clinton was still busy securing her spot in history as the first woman to win a major party\u2019s nomination, some pundits lamented that the party had not chosen a more likable woman for the historic moment \u2014 a woman like, say, Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThere are many reasons why likability is a flawed metric for political candidates, men and women alike. But there is something particularly pernicious about the recent trend of evaluating women this way.\n\n\u201cWant a female commander-in-chief? Do you desire an aspirational nominee? How about someone who would bring Wall Street to heel? Elizabeth Warren is all those things, in one person,\u201d Real Clear Politics\u2019 Carl M. Cannon wrote in April 2016.\n\nThere are many reasons why likability is a flawed metric for political candidates, men and women alike. But there is something particularly pernicious about the recent trend of evaluating women this way. Research has shown again and again that powerful women are held to different standards than men. The hypocrisy of the likability metric becomes even more clear when you compare the way Warren the potential 2020 candidate is being described with Warren the (less threatening) senator from Massachusetts.\n\nIn 2016, Cannon wrote that Warren would indeed bring more warmth than Clinton, pointing to an anecdote she shared on Facebook about how she would bake her mother a \u201cheart shaped cake\u201d as a child. He contrasted that with Clinton\u2019s sarcastic \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies\u201d comment from 1992, which was a response to ongoing questions about why she chose to continue her law practice when her husband was governor of Arkansas.\n\nFor some Bernie Sanders supporters, meanwhile, praising Warren was a way to deflect accusations of sexism. In a 2016 Huffington Post opinion piece titled, \u201cI Despise Hillary Clinton And It Has Nothing to Do With Her Gender,\u201d Isaac Saul wrote that he \u201cand many Sanders supporters would vote for Elizabeth Warren if she were in the race over Hillary or Bernie.\u201d (Saul apologized to Clinton for being a \u201csmug young journalist\u201d and \u201cBernie Bro\u201d in a follow up article months later, writing that his views of her changed after he endeavored to learn more about her history).\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here? Has Warren become incredibly unlikable over the past two years? Or is this change more an indication of her growing power. High-achieving women, sociologist Marianne Cooper wrote in a 2013 Harvard Business Review article, are judged differently than men because \u201ctheir very success \u2014 and specifically the behaviors that created that success \u2014 violates our expectations about how women are supposed to behave.\u201d When women act competitively or assertively rather than warm and nurturing, Cooper writes, they \u201celicit pushback from others for being insufficiently feminine and too masculine.\u201d As a society, she says, \u201cwe are deeply uncomfortable with powerful women. In fact, we don\u2019t often really like them.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Warren\u2019s expressed desire to potentially become America\u2019s most powerful politician has changed the calculus. After all, Hillary Clinton was a popular secretary of state; Warren is a popular senator.\n\nWarren\u2019s expressed desire to potentially become America\u2019s most powerful politician has changed the calculus.\n\nResearch bears this out. In a study from the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Women and Public Policy Program, when participants saw women as power-seeking, they \u201cexperienced feelings of moral outrage (i.e. contempt, anger, and/or disgust)\u201d toward them and saw them as \u201cless supportive or caring.\u201d When participants saw male politicians as power-seeking, though, that impression instead led them to view the men \u201cas having greater agency (e.g. being more assertive, stronger, and tougher) and greater competence.\u201d Women, in short, were penalized for seeking power, even as men were rewarded for it.\n\nThe kind of outrage observed in the study might explain why Clinton\u2019s favorables have always plummeted whenever she announced that she was seeking higher office. Her favorable ratings reached a peak of 67 percent in 1999, only to slump to the mid-40s when she ran for the Senate in 2000. Her favorable rating rose while she was on the job, though, reaching 58 percent in 2007, only to crater back to the 40s again as soon as she announced her 2008 run for president.\n\nIn a 2012 Talking Points Memo article, Benjy Sarlin (now a reporter for NBC News) dubbed then-Secretary of State Clinton \u201cbadass cool.\u201d Not only did the nation\u2019s top diplomat have a 66 percent favorable rating, she had recently become the subject of a popular meme.\n\nSome, though, had already noticed the pattern and doubted the good times would last.\n\n\u201cThe current Internet-fueled lovefest between Hillary and America is probably as doomed as Romeo and Juliet,\u201d The Cut columnist Ann Friedman wrote that December. Sure enough, as talk of a second presidential run heated up, Clinton\u2019s approval began falling again, sinking to 41 percent when she officially joined the race in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe more a woman is in service to someone else,\u201d the more likable she is, Clinton explained to NBC News in 2017, describing her work at the State Department as having been \u201cin service to my country\u201d and \u201cin service to our president.\u201d \u201cI was proud to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when a woman walks into the arena and says, \u2018I\u2019m going in this for myself,\u2019 it really does have a dramatic effect on how people perceive.\u201d\n\nThough Warren was the darling of those who said, \u201cI\u2019d vote for a woman \u2014 just not that woman,\u201d she is no stranger to the likability rollercoaster.\n\nWhen Warren was first running for U.S. Senate in 2012, her favorables lagged behind those of Republican Sen. Scott Brown. Her bid to unseat him was not guaranteed, even in liberal Massachusetts. \u201cWarren and her hectoring, know-it-all style leaves\u201d women disappointed, Democratic analyst Dan Payne wrote at the time, complaining that \u201call she does in her ads is complain about national problems,\u201d and describing her as \u201cpreachy\u201d and \u201clawyer-like.\u201d\n\nPayne suggested she \u201close the granny glasses,\u201d \u201csoften the hair\u201d and get coaching to \u201cdeepen her voice, which grates on some.\u201d She should also practice \u201c a little modesty,\u201d he said, and \u201cstop the finger-wagging\u201d because \u201cit adds to her strict schoolmarm appearance and bossy manner.\u201d\n\nPayne\u2019s screed could easily be mistaken for a satire of misogynistic garbage \u2014 but he was serious. What he was really criticizing was Warren\u2019s tone \u2014 a metric for measuring likability that women are uniquely subjected to.\n\nIn a 2014 Fortune article, CEO Kieran Snyder examined the question of tone in an experiment in which she asked people to submit their employer\u2019s reviews of their job performance. Snyder examined 248 reviews \u2014 105 from men and 75 from women \u2014 and found that 58.9 percent of male employees\u2019 reviews included critical feedback, while 87.9 percent of female employees\u2019 reviews did. The results were even more stark when Snyder looked at the kind of criticism men and women received: 71 of the 94 critical reviews received by women included criticisms of their tone. Only 2 out of 83 critical reviews received by men included the same criticism, with comments focused mostly on things like the need to hone their strategies or develop their skills.\n\nIn 2016, Bernie Sanders\u2019 shouting, finger-wagging style often earned him praise for his \u201cauthenticity\u201d and \u201cpassion.\u201d Clinton was at times criticized as \u201cpassionless\u201d for her \u201crobotic\u201d style, but showing emotion lead to worries that she was \u201cshrill.\u201d When Warren wags her fingers, she doesn\u2019t get to be the passionate, cool old guy like Sanders; men like Payne and GOP strategist Rick Wilson call her a schoolmarm for it.\n\nLikability has long since outlived its speculative usefulness. And there is no clearer an example than Elizabeth Warren\u2019s contradictory treatment in the press. Women do not become unlikable overnight. At this rate, the only likable female president would be one who didn\u2019t want the job."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/juli-n-castro-may-not-beat-trump-2020-he-face-ncna958621", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nJan. 15, 2019, 4:32 PM GMT By Julio Ricardo Varela\n\nEven as the Trump administration continues its core policy of \u201cothering\u201d Latino Americans for political gain, one Latino Democrat candidate has officially entered the presidential race, telling us that he can be an \u201cantidote\u201d to the current political climate of fear and xenophobia.\n\nThe question for Juli\u00e1n Castro and his supporters, however, is this: Will he be the right Latino candidate for the time of Trump? If his Saturday announcement in West San Antonio is any indication, the answer is not so simple.\n\nCastro\u2019s speech was definitively moderate in tone (even with his spoken support for causes like climate change, Black Lives Matter and housing equality). Yet in a campaign season during which immigration will be the key issue coming from the Trump campaign -- assuming Trump runs for re-election \u2014 Castro\u2019s words against Trump lacked the bite of even most cable news talking heads.\n\nJulian Castro greets residents in Playita, one of the poorest and most affected communities in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Jan. 14, 2019. Carlos Giusti / AP\n\n\u201cJust a couple days ago, President Trump visited McAllen Texas, just south of here, after claiming that we\u2019re facing an \u2018invasion\u2019 at our border. He called it a national security crisis,\" Castro said on Saturday in San Antonio. \"Well, there is a crisis today. It\u2019s a crisis of leadership. Donald Trump has failed to uphold the values of our great nation.\u201d\n\nStill, Castro\u2019s speech, which was brimming with bilingual and bicultural touches, was met very positively; for many young, politically-involved Latinos who grew up in the Obama era, seeing something who looks like them, who shares a common story and, yes, is not afraid to show off the accent in his name is a historic moment of political representation.\n\nCastro is the first Mexican-American Democrat to run for president since Bill Richardson\u2019s bid in 2008; given that Democrats are supposed to be about diversity and representation, Castro\u2019s move feels long overdue. Besides which, after the then-former San Antonio mayor gave a primetime speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, there were rumblings that Castro was thinking of a bid in 2016, when he was still Housing and Urban Development Secretary under Obama. But Castro seemingly banked on staying in Washington under a Hillary Clinton administration.\n\nThat never happened and, ever since, one of the Democrats\u2019 rising young stars has been figuring out what to do next. Last year in Miami, for instance, Castro gave a speech in front of a predominantly Latino audience, where he talked about putting community first and fighting back hard against an administration that has painted Latinos as criminals. Shouts of \u201cJuli\u00e1n Presidente\u201d echoed through the ballroom.\n\nHe's floated several other trial balloons since then, never really saying that he would run, but hinting that he would. And while he has celebrated his mother\u2019s Chicana activist past of the 1970s, he still shied away from terming it \u201cradical.\u201d\n\nWhich is why asking if Castro will be the right Latino candidate in the time of Trump is valid; it's unclear whether being a Latino moderate in what will be a very crowded Democratic field will be the right play.\n\nAfter all, the very same young Latino voters to whom Castro might be appealing on Twitter might not share his same views on the immigration debate. After the 2018 midterm cycle \u2014 when calls to Abolish ICE led to victories for Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. \u2014 calling for \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d rings a bit hollow. Immigrant rights activists are already thinking bolder, saying that new leaders new to stop acquiescing to Trump and demand a real pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nSo will Castro be the candidate who boldly calls for full amnesty, or will he be a legacy of an Obama administration that deported millions of undocumented immigrants while failing to negotiate even a moderate solution on immigration that would appease Republicans?\n\nMaybe Castro will surprise us. He did seem fired up on Saturday, and he led with his powerful family story: In 1922, his grandmother came to United States from Mexico as a 7-year-old orphan. As an adult, she was a maid and single mom; his mother was a Chicana activist; and now his twin brother is a member of Congress and he is running for president.\n\nThat story might not necessarily hit home in a place like Iowa or New Hampshire, but it will resonate in Nevada \u2014 the third primary state of the 2020 season, where Latinos make up close to 30 percent of the state\u2019s population. It will resonate in places like Texas, California, Arizona and Colorado. It resonated in Puerto Rico, Castro's first stop of his campaign, where he said this on Monday, \"I can guarantee you that a lot of people in D.C. are underestimating my campaign.\"\n\nCastro and his team also know that Latinos came out to vote in the 2018 midterms despite questions about 2016, and the electorate is younger and more Latino than ever before.\n\nBut it's too early to tell whether Castro can do enough to make a decent showing, either for his future chances or those of other Latino candidates down the line.

Do you compulsively refresh your Twitter feed? Can you find your way around without Google Maps? There are many obvious and tactile ways in which Silicon Valley has its hooks in our everyday lives. And as we see Big Tech face increased scrutiny, people are becoming more conscious of their interactions with their products: limiting screen time, quitting Facebook, shopping locally.\n\nBut fully divorcing yourself from these companies is a lot harder than you may think, as journalist Kashmir Hill discovered. Because besides our obvious interactions with Big Tech, there are many more invisible ways these products and innovations touch our lives. This is Kashmir\u2019s story of what happens when you shine a light on those unseen encounters.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: I turn off my phone at night, like at 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. I just turn it off, which I used to never do. My phone would be on until the battery died. And that would be a very traumatic event. So now I turn off my phone at night. It's not the first thing I reach for in the morning. Whereas before I touch my husband, before I talked to my daughter, I would I just pick the phone up as soon as I woke up and start scrolling through it. I realized I actually hate that. I don't want to start my day every day mainlining the internet through this technology that has been forced upon me by the tech giants in the world that they're creating.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to \"Why Is This Happening?\" with me your host, Chris Hayes. Like everyone in the modern world, I spend too much time on my phone. And I have a lot of self-loathing over that. I'm trying to decrease my phone time, decrease my screen time. But of course, part of the problem with that is that the phone is engineered to make you look at it as much as possible. It's like a casino. There's lots of thought that's gone into how to make it so that even that little click, when you reload Twitter or these little haptic bits of feedback are reaching into your brainstem to tell you, oh, that's a pellet of satisfaction. And they've engineered the device to make you want to look at it as much as possible.\n\nIt's the same with the incredibly seamless way that streaming services have figured out to get the little box in there and just seamlessly go to that next episode so that you have to actually go and affirmatively say \"No, I don't want to watch another episode.\" They did that because they had lots of data. They were able to run the human experiments on us, the subjects, to see what are the ways that we can optimize the engineering of what we have to make people use our product as much as possible. So much about the tech world feels like that, I mean, that's what Facebook is doing. That's what Amazon is doing. That's what Apple is doing with the iPhone. At a certain point, you feel like you don't have any actual independent agency or autonomy with respect to the various digital services or digital devices you use.\n\nThey're just kind of there and they're just pulling at you and they're getting their hooks into you and you're using them all the time. And there's this question of like, how can you just step away? Can you just stop? I see a lot of people really recently, I think, particularly around phone use. A lot of people deleting Facebook. There's a kind of rising sensation among the zeitgeist, I think, that we should taking individual and collective affirmative steps to kind of step back and fight against all of that engineering that has gone into making us addicted and hooked to and constantly drawn into the world of the kind of digital vortex.\n\nSo then the question becomes like, well how can you do it? Can you just get away from these? What if you just don't want to use this stuff anymore? And that brings me to today's guest, Kashmir Hill, she's an investigative reporter at Gizmodo. She's a really, really great tech reporter. I've been following her work for years. I think, as you'll hear in our conversations, she really distinguished her reporting early on for being, I think, far more skeptical of the claims of Silicon Valley than many of the other people reporting on those same companies. Particularly during the frothiest years of rah-rah, cheerleaderism for the way that Silicon Valley was gonna transform the world and be the future of American society.\n\nWe're now in a much different place I think, in the way that we think about those companies and about the effects of their products, but she was ahead of the curve on that. And she undertook this deceptively simple project at Gizmodo. And the deceptively simple project was like, \"I'm just gonna give up this stuff. I'm just gonna not use it. What happens?\" That's it, that's the full thing. And she spun out this incredible reporting project based on that just deceptively simple premise, which as you'll hear is astoundingly harder than that simple articulation of it is. I'm not going to use this stuff. Let's see what happens to my life when I step back from some of the biggest tech companies in our lives. Like our conversation with Stacy Mitchell about Amazon, you're gonna learn a lot about just how ubiquitous big tech is in our lives.\n\nYou've been a tech reporter for awhile, right?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: It has been a decade, I think. Maybe a little bit more than a decade. I wasn't a tech reporter when I started. So I don't know when I morphed into a tech reporter but somewhere along the way people started putting me on tech lists.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And then you've been reporting about Silicon Valley and tech for awhile. It seems to me that tech reporting has changed a ton, particularly recently and as someone who's been a practitioner for a little while, what do you think has changed?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: I think other tech reporters are more like me now. I really did not come from a tech-reporting background. I was at a legal blog called \"Above The Law.\" My background was in law and I got interested in privacy and I was writing about privacy and law and I kinda just backed into technology because I was writing about how our privacy was changing in the modern world and it forced me to start writing about cookies and tracking and all these new technologies that were being developed to track us.\n\nI would say I came into writing about technology from a more critical perspective in terms of how it was invading privacy as opposed to being a person that was kind of covering the business of tech or covering amazing new gadgets. I think people who came from that perspective, tended to be more enthrall of the tech industry. And amazed by all the incredible new things that it was doing and bringing into the world and making possible. And now, I think there's been a shift and those reporters and those publications are far more critical of the tech giants now. And there's more of a backlash in tech reporting. So I would say that overall it's become more negative but I'm proud to say I was always pretty negative.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: You've been a hater from day one is what you're trying to say.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, exactly.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Well, I think that's the reason that your work first stood out to me was for that reason when I started reading you on privacy, when you were writing about privacy back in \"Above The Law.\" And your work has been critical and clear-eyed in a way that a lot of tech reporting was not but more is now. To what do you attribute the change?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: One, I think that these companies and it's part of what my series touches on, have just become so much more powerful. And they're not little start-ups anymore. Google used to do amazing searches. Amazon made it easier to buy things online. Facebook helped us figure out who else in our class was hot and ask them out. And now, these companies do so much more. Amazon is powering the backbone of the web. Google is all over the internet. You can't go around online without running into something Google, they control all mapping technology essentially that's used online.\n\nDado Ruvic / Reuters\n\nAnd Facebook bought Instagram and bought WhatsApp and controls most of the social media that we consume. It's where all of our friends are living online. So, one, they've just gotten to be bigger players that I think attract more criticism. And they're starting to have real effects on how we live and some of those things are very negative. I mean, honestly, sometimes I think they get outsized attention or blame for things that are happening in society. But they do play huge roles in our everyday life now and I think that yes, it's engendered some criticism.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, so the ubiquity, the size of the scope and the power and then also to me, I think, finding out what's underneath the hood is a big part of it. That you have the sense that I'm interacting with this thing and I'm writing the email and my understanding of my interaction with Gmail is like, they make a free software product, I use it, okay. I kick them five bucks a year, whatever, for some storage. That's not where the relationship ends. They're learning lots of things about me, everything about me. They're reading all of my words and they're using that to make money by essentially selling it. And I think to me, speaking for myself, the reality of that as a business model was much less clear to me, say three or four years ago than it is now.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Right, maybe people understand the price we're actually paying online now. What's more disturbing is that I think other players looked at these tech giants and said, \"Wow, they're making so much money just off of people's data. We should start doing that too.\"\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: So you see things that we pay for, like our phone carriers. They're collecting data about our location and what we're looking at on our phones and they started packaging that up and they anonymize it and aggregate it and then they sell that. So even something you're paying $100 a year for, they're still packaging up your data and selling it. So that's been another kind of harmful effect of the spread of the tech giants business model.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And this gets to what your project is, right? So describe to me what your undertaking is and how you came up with the idea?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: So when you're critical of these companies, when you say they're too powerful or they're too privacy invasive, people often will say, \"Oh well, if you don't like Facebook, don't use its products. If you don't like Google, just get off Gmail.\" And so I wanted to explore that argument and find out if it's possible not to use the company if you don't like it. And so that was kind of what I was trying to tackle here. And I found out that it's not possible to avoid them with the exception of Apple. Even if you choose to boycott their products, you're still interacting with them really all the time that you're online and with Microsoft and the rest really but in the real world as well. So you can't totally avoid them.\n\nThe idea actually came to me because there's many people that are especially critical of Google. Google has a lot of enemies. And so somebody pitched me on the idea, they're like, \"Google's so powerful, you should try to avoid them and write about how hard it is.\" And I was like, \"Oh, that's actually a good idea but I want to do it with all the technology companies.\"\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Turns out Amazon pitched you on that story. They're like, \"You know who's really bad? You know who's really, really bad?\" So you set out with the project, I mean, I want to just reiterate a thing you just said. You can't choose not to use some of these companies. That's what you're saying, that's what you've concluded.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, some of these companies are just unavoidable. You have to use them because or you will encounter them because they're all around the website and you're gonna use services that are using their services.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: To live in the modern world is to use Amazon for instance?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yes.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And Google.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Mm, yes.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So tell me what you did, so you've got Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, right?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yes.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Those are the big five. Okay.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: A lot of people are mad at me 'cause every time I would tweet one of these stories, they're like, well, what about Twitter? But I was trying to stick to kind of like, the really big five, the companies that people sometimes call the frightful five.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Well, don't you also think that Twitter, in some ways, doing the experiment with Twitter I think would prove out the point which is that you can cut Twitter out of your life.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, you'll probably run into the tweet button around the web but, I think it would be pretty easy.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I mean, you'll run into people-\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Maybe healthy to cut out of my life.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yes, oh my god, would it be healthy. You run into people reading the president's tweets on the television. But from the tech standpoint. I mean, so you say, I'm gonna go through this sequence cutting these out, you start with Amazon, so my first thought was like, okay, not ordering anything from Amazon. Okay, yeah, sort of inconvenient but that's the tip of the iceberg, right? How did you go about doing this to make sure you were 100 percent cut off from Amazon?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Right. I didn't want to just boycott their products. In part, because journalists have done that before. They've stopped using Facebook. They stopped using Google and they write about how hard it is. But I wanted to really cut myself off from them. In part, to make it a more interesting stunt but also to really understand how often I was encountering them in invisible ways, which I knew was happening because I write about the technology industry.\n\nSo I worked with a technologist named Dhruv Mehrotra, and I wasn't sure exactly how to do this. I went to him and I said, \"Hey, I want to cut the tech giants out of my life completely, I don't want to interact with them at all. How do I do it?\" And he went and did some research and came back to me and said, \"Oh hey, all the technology giants publish these list of all the IP addresses, the internet protocol addresses that they control. So I could build something for you that would just prevent your devices from being able to interact with those IP addresses. To send anything to them or receive anything from them. And that way I would just cut you off entirely from these companies servers.\"\n\nSo it means that Google's analytics on a page just wouldn't be able to load. Facebook's like button wouldn't appear there and any website that was hosted by one of these companies, which turned out most of the time to be AWS or Amazon Web Services. It just wouldn't load.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So this is the first thing I found shocking and hadn't even thought of is, the sheer amount of just web traffic and IP addresses controlled by these companies. It's enormous.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, it's really big. I mean, what was fun about the stories \u2026 I love any story that dives into how the internet works. I think most of us just kind of think about it, is this like invisible vapor around us that you click on an app or type in a URL and then just information is there. So I always think it's fun to dive into all the ... I mean the internet's a strange place with all these standards bodies. So anyways, Dhruv did this research for me and said, Amazon and Microsoft control over 20 million IP addresses. Google had about nine million, which I was kind of surprised by, that it was a bit of a laggard there. Facebook had only about 122,000 or something, a very small amount of IP addresses. And Apple had a bunch, I think they were around 16 million.\n\nAnd this is just like the number of IP addresses that they own, they're kind of squatting on them. And sometimes IP addresses, attach to a device on the internet. But it just gives them a way to roll out services and have a place for your internet traffic to go to get them.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah so, I guess, I'm sort of debating in my head how in the weeds of this to get because I will confess that I have no idea how the internet works. I mean, I really don't understand. It is basically magic and there's stuff floating around the air. There's how many bars I have on phone and then it's like [beeping noises] beams in. I know there are servers, I know there are networks. I know an IP address is a unique locator and that traffic goes in packets and hops from these sort of noted clusters from place to place and moves over these wires. But that's it. So when you say in the first one, you start to block all the Amazon IP addresses, my question is what are they? What does that mean? What can't you see?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: So I think the easiest way to think about it is those IP addresses, think of them as directions. IP addresses are directions to Amazon's server.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Mm-hmm.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: And so every time my devices wanted to direct themselves towards Amazon's servers, Dhruv's blocker said, \"Nope, you can't go this way.\"\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And that happened a lot.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: It happened a lot, we did run into one little problem, and this is again how the internet works, Amazon AWS servers are huge servers that have all this data. And then sometimes a company wants its website to load faster. So they'll have a secondary service, called a content delivery network or CDN, and these are companies that have a whole bunch of little servers that are more prolific and so when you load a website, sometimes it'll get the information from that CDN, the little machines, who are storing it from the big machines from Amazon and it just means that you don't have to wait for the data packets to come all the way from the Amazon warehouse. You can get it from this smaller warehouse that's closer to your device. And so if we saw that CDN, we wouldn't realize it was coming from Amazon. So sometimes it messed up our blocker.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. So just to go back, so you set up a ... Your tech dude sets up a VPN, it says for week one, no Amazon IP addresses. One of the first things you learn is actually even that doesn't fully screen on Amazon because there's these sort of small retail outfits whose backends are actually Amazon but don't look like Amazon to the VPNs so they're getting through. So you gotta try to figure that out. What else are you starting to deal with in week one of no Amazon?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: So just websites not working. And I'm a journalist and I was trying to do work this week and so I tried to go ... Every government website stopped working for me because they all use AWS.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Every government website?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Every government website that I tried to use. I didn't try all the government websites but I was doing some research that took me to a few of them. Journalism websites went down, I'm using this car rental service right now, called Drive Canvas and its website stopped working so I couldn't go see my bills. Some of my apps stopped working. I went for a run and I couldn't record the run on Runkeeper because it used AWS in some way.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: But the bigger problem was that it cut off of all digital entertainment for me. Because all video streaming sites use AWS, even Netflix, which is a big Amazon competitor.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wait, whoa. You mentioned that in the piece but I thought I was misunderstanding, because I thought you were just ... It's so funny, I thought you were just like a real Amazon Prime home for some reason and just super loyal to Amazon Prime so you cut off Amazon Prime and was like, \"Well, we can't watch anything.\" But what you're saying is, literally everything streams through the AWS backend, no matter what you're streaming it over.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Pretty much. I mean, in my experience, HBO Go was down. Netflix was down, Hulu was down. AWS-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That's crazy!\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, it's crazy and I think we could have listened to Spotify because Spotify is hosted by Google, except we listened to Spotify through our Amazon Echo, which I had to put away in a drawer. So yeah, we just had a very silent house. It's insane. Amazon recognized about a decade ago that web hosting was an important business, I think they're finding it with their own business, they developed this solution and then they released it to the world. And AWS is now the most profitable part of Amazon, not it's retail. Tons of people use them. They just have, I guess, a great service. Even their competitors are relying on them to host their movies and their data.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I mean, the implications here are kinda crazy because Amazon's Prime Video is this big play they're making to compete with Netflix. You can imagine a world in which they're like, \"Oh look at that, would you look at that, we had a little glitch and then Netflix streaming went out.\" I mean, they're clearly not doing that now. I think if they were, we would know about it. It's a little weird that that is possibility.\n\nA man holds a smart phone with the icons for the social networking apps Facebook, Instagram and Twitter seen on the screen. Kirill Kudryavtsev / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nKASHMIR HILL: I know. What's hilarious is actually whenever we watch Amazon Prime Video, the streaming quality is terrible. I'm like, take lessons from Netflix.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It is ironic, actually. So you cut your entertainment. You cut a million websites. My big takeaway from the Amazon week for you was, you cut ordering stuff from them which was a little bit of a pain. There's a great story about how you order something on Ebay and it comes in an Amazon package?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Why?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Well, Amazon is so dominant in the kind of storage and shipping industry, that they have something called Fulfillment by Amazon. A lot of people that use competitors still use Amazon for storage and shipping.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I mean-\n\nKASHMIR HILL: So I ordered from Ebay but it came from Amazon in an Amazon package.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And there's a funny part, you eat some Whole Foods sushi, which you only realize after you put it in your mouth ... But it seemed to me that when you divide up that Amazon week, the ordering stuff and the Whole Foods and stuff is that you live withoutable, it's the architecture of the backend of the internet that is not.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Right, which I kind of knew. I knew AWS was big. I didn't realize how big it was and I found that a lot of people reading the story didn't know about Amazon Web Services. Because it's invisible to you as your navigating the web. I've had a lot of people I talk to during the series, compare it to the environmental movement or the food movement. The slow food movement and being digital vegans, who are really careful about where their data comes from. But I think most people are just using the internet aren't thinking about where the data is coming from. I don't know, maybe that'll change but it was really interesting for me to be able see this because I type in a website and it just won't load.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So what was the next hardest one to cut out?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: I think the next hardest was probably Google. I mean Google does do cloud hosting as well. Though they're not nearly as popular as AWS. But it was more that Google was really unlike all the sites that I went to and in a lot of apps. It's just that Google provides services that are used across the web. For example, I ran into on tons of sites something called Google Fonts and I could see that the website was trying desperately to load Google Fonts. And I\u2019m like, \"What the hell is Google Fonts? I've never heard of this before.\" It's a repository that they released around the time that they released Google Chrome that will automatically populate your browser with a whole bunch of font options. So that a website doesn't have to get the font from your computer and figure out a different font if your computer doesn't have it stored. So lots of sites use it.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Turns out the entire internet is in comic sans without Google Fonts, like every page you load.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Man, that would be great for getting people to use the internet less.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So Google Fonts, which you as a tech reporter didn't know the product existed.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: I didn't. I didn't. Google says that they don't use it to track anybody, they have it in a kind of an FAQ somewhere. But still it means that, I mean, any site that has Google Fonts, you're interacting with Google's server and there's some information about you that's kind of being sent to them. Could be really basic and it doesn't sound like they use it. But I was just surprised to have it there on top of tons of other stuff, like Google Ads, Google Analytics. Just random Google trackers and then Google Maps are everywhere.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That was the striking thing to me was that Google Maps really are the backbone of geolocation. Is that a fair statement?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yes. Absolutely, I tried to pull up stats on this and they didn't seem to exist in the same way that stats exist for other categories. But I basically looked at websites that look at the elements in various maps and apps. And it was something like, 80 percent or more of maps are powered by Google or by the Google Maps API, which is just quite a monopoly on the market. And the way that this manifested for me is that one morning I needed to get to a meeting and I was planning on Uber-ing there or Lyft-ing there but neither app would work for me and I'm like, \"What is going on?\" I just couldn't enter the destination. And it turned out that they were non-operational without being able to access Google Maps. I just couldn't even enter a destination.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, you opt out of Google, you basically opt out of GPS functionally which is what I learned from your reporting, which I did not know. Again-\n\nKASHMIR HILL: I wouldn't say you opt out of GPS, my iPhone still knows where I-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Your iPhone does, okay.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Where I am.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: But individual apps or other things that are using the API, what is an API?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: It's like an automated way for computers to interact with database and pool information out of it.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: I was really surprised because I don't know if your listeners would know but Yelp is a very big critic and enemy of Google. Because they've been so mad about the way that Google prioritizes its own listings above Yelp\u2019s.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yes.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: They've been in kind of like in an anti-trust battle for a long time but when I went to Yelp.com to find a restaurant to go to for lunch one day, it's map wouldn't load because it was using Google Maps.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: From the sort of internet infrastructural standpoint, Google and Amazon are near the top. I thought Microsoft was interesting in its inclusion because I think of Microsoft, I associate Microsoft with my childhood. I think of Microsoft in the same category as Sega Genesis. It really was of the moment at a certain point in my life. And then I stopped thinking about Microsoft as big tech player. I stopped thinking of Microsoft is being totally dominant, which in my youth they were. There was a big anti-trust case against them. Bill Gates was famously the richest man in the world. Yada, yada, yada. But Microsoft is still an enormous player.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, we think, oh Microsoft's not cool anymore. But it's huge, I mean, it's constantly in competition for most valuable public company in the world. Of course, they make the X-Box, which is I think kinda cool. They make the workhorses of social media or they own them. GitHub, LinkedIn and Skype, which Skype I use quite a lot. They do that stuff that we traditionally associate with them, which is Windows Servers and Windows Office and Outlook. Those things are definitely still around and making the company a lot of money. I thought it would be really easy to get off Microsoft products and it was as a consumer but I just kind of started to notice when I was out and about, every time I went to a coffee shop, I was like, oh, this could very well be their point of sale system is probably run on a Microsoft server.\n\nAnd I was on BART, which is the subway in San Francisco and I was like, \"This is probably run on Microsoft.\" And I got into my car one day and I looked down, and it's a Ford Fusion 2015 and on the center console, which I never noticed before, was Sync, powered by Microsoft. So Microsoft was powering this entertainment navigation system in my car. Even though we don't think of ... They're not a super consumer-happy brand where we're thinking about, \"oh, we're using Microsoft all the time\" but they are still embedded in the infrastructure of our cities and in lots of governments, probably because their technology is kind of dated, are definitely still reliant on Microsoft.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: We work off of Microsoft workstations every day at the office. It would be a blissful release if I didn't have to do that. Really don't like my Windows machine. Sorry, tech, if you're listening, sorry. So Apple was the easiest, you say?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: So Apple was emotionally difficult for me because-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Your phone.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: My phone, my laptop, my work laptop. I mean, Apple is kind of like my portal to all things digital. I became an Apple user maybe six years ago and once you become an Apple user, you're just kind of trapped in their ecosystem, all their ... I won't use a curse word here but their ports just the constantly changed ports. Oh, sorry, we're not gonna have a headphone jack anymore. I'm like, come on Apple, what is the matter with you.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It is a dysfunctional relationship in my life where I got into this relationship with Apple. I liked their computers way more than I liked Windows. One of the reasons I got into it because iTunes and the early iPhone, which I had, you could sync music much more easily. And then as the years have gone by, it's become less and less usable. The products have gotten less and less usable. I mean, I do not have the IQ to work iTunes. I just don't get it. I don't understand it anymore. It makes me feel like a complete out of it old man because I don't understand the interface of iTunes.\n\nAnd I generally feel frustrated with Apple products a fair amount but there's no getting out. I can't get out. I got the ports and I've the account and everything's synced up in this one way and then I'm just stuck there. And they know that. And they know that so they don't work to make it any better.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, we were Marie Kondo-ing our house and we just have 1,000 different Apple cords. I'm like, \"Do we even have a computer to go with this particular cord at this point?\" And it's also that Apple \u2014 I'm gonna generalize a little bit \u2014 but they make privacy and security easier. And so that keeps me there. And it's something I pay more for their products just for that kind of easy privacy security that's just kind of built in to it. It was just hard to get used to non-Apple products 'cause I hadn't used them in so long. But once I did get used to them, it wasn't that hard being away from Apple and I didn't encounter them anymore. If you don't use an Apple product, Apple doesn't track you, they're not trying to collect data about you.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Kara Swisher and I did an interview with Tim Cook and it got a lot of news because he was pretty critical of Mark Zuckerberg who we'll talk about in a second and Facebook. But he made that point. Look, we made a decision that we sell you products, we engineer products, we sell you those products, we want you to purchase those products. That's how we make our money and we don't sell your data. That's not the business that we're in and we want you to have privacy and security and by in large relative to the other companies, that's true. But the other thing that I found insidious was your discovery in that week, which is because of that, even though it was emotionally hard to give up, they were the easiest one to avoid because they have made that decision.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Right, Apple, because they've made that decision and Apple's basically not trying to sell products to non-Apple users. Which is part of the wall guard and it's part of what's kind of frustrating about them. Yeah, they're just not trying to reach across the divide. So yeah, they're not trying collect your data. I mean they did for awhile have iAds, which doesn't fit easily into Cook's narrative but they abandoned that, I think because it wasn't doing that well. Yes, it allowed them to just go the way of, we just sell you hardware-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It's really interesting.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: The kind of privacy promises are, they seem reliable.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, to me it's the ultimate illustration of the perverse incentives. Because if you make those ... I mean, I guess it's not because Apple's one the most profitable companies in the world. So it's not like they're suffering. But right, they've made a bet that we're gonna make superior products and people will pay for that. But the idea that they're ubiquity is less because they've made that choice, is a little unnerving because it makes me think that the incentives are for ubiquity and selling people's data and using their data and running things behind the scenes. And if those are the incentives, that's what we're gonna get more of.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Well, I guess there's that lesson. I think the other lesson is, whether privacy becomes a luxury good. And Apple products are expensive products and part of what you're paying for is that this is a company that's not gonna be trying to monetize you or kind of track you in creepy ways. One of the kind of bigger takeaways from this project was if don't want to live in this surveillance economy, maybe we'll have to pay for things online. But that means that privacy will only be afforded to people who are wealthy. And people who can't afford it like, the poor, the most vulnerable people in society will continue to be exploited. So that's problematic to me. That's capitalism at work and that's where you think, oh maybe government needs to get involved and regulate this whole thing.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That brings us to Facebook, which in some ways, I think, Facebook is most controversial right now. Has had the most negative press. I just think they handle all of it terribly. I can't tell, what do you think? Is it that what they're doing is indefensible or they've handled it terribly, I don't think I can figure it out.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Which thing? I mean.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Fundamentally the way that they are using your data and not regulating their platform, basically.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: So one thing I think is weird about Facebook is I just don't think that people who created Facebook ever dreamed of what Facebook would become. And I think all along the way, they have just been kind of haphazardly building this thing. Never realizing that one day they would have over a billion people using it and that they would become the data intermediary for a good portion of the world. And so, I always just feel like they're kind of just doing things haphazardly and not thinking about the consequences. And that the people who run it, just have no idea what the world is like for people who don't look like them.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That seems like a totally accurate diagnosis but it also seems like the one they in a weird way are pushing. Because it's more exculpatory than the more nefarious one. Which is like, \"Oh shucks, oh darn. We just didn't understand this whole Rohingya thing and woo, I guess we aided a genocide. We've got a whole team now working on it.\" It's like, that's not good enough.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: No.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That's my feeling. It's not good enough. You have the power and if you can't wield the power. The power has to be taken away from you. Because there is concrete evidence your platform is being used literally in the commission of genocide. Which is the worst thing that human beings do to each other and you're implicated in it.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I don't think that they were able to foresee that in any way. I don't think they really know how to fix it.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah. What did you learn when you tried to block them?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: And yeah, I've long been critical of Facebook.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I'm the one ranting about blood on their hands. So just to be-\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I just always think about, basically for the last two years or more, I've been obsessed with Facebook's \"People You May Know\" and how they figure out who we know in real life. Just because it's so creepy to people. And one of the things I figured out they are doing is every time you upload your contacts to Facebook, you're basically like outing anybody who's in there and Facebook takes that information and it layers it on other people's accounts. So maybe I've only given Facebook my phone number but if you give them my phone number and two email addresses for me, that all gets kind of layered into my account and by having this vast black book of the whole world they can figure out who knows who.\n\nAnd this resulted in sex workers having their identities outed to their clients. I discovered that was happening before I understood the contact thing and Facebook just wouldn't really engage with me and tell me how is it that sex workers and their clients are being connected through your platform. Sex workers use burner phones, burner email addresses. They have a fake name, their clients are doing the same thing and yet you're somehow still making these connections. And Facebook was kind of like, \"Oh, we don't really know how that would happen.\" They wouldn't be transparent about all that goes into \"People You May Know\" that would help people protect themselves against this.\n\nAnd that's what really bothers me so much about Facebook is that, one, I don't think they sympathize with the sex worker at all. And two, they don't want to be really candid with us about how their platform works. And so it makes it hard for us to protect ourselves against Facebook.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: No, that's exactly the thing that I find maddening about it. I'm not trying to single out Facebook as the most nefarious American company. I think the oil industry takes that crown. But I find them very gaslightly, I guess is what I would say over the last few years in the wake of this negative press, which is very much like, \"Oh yeah, no, don't worry, it's the secret sauce. No, we're not doing that, okay maybe. Well, yeah, there was actually a lot of that.\" Which feels like the revelation arc in everything and I just find it a little maddening.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I get very frustrated by this company. I will say, so going off Facebook, they actually didn't track me that much once I wasn't using Facebook products. All this to say, all this bad stuff about Facebook, when it came down to it ... So we built this VPN that I was using to block myself off from the giants. At the same time we are blocking, we are tracking how often my devices were trying to interact with that giant and so the week I was blocking Facebook, it was much less. Google tried to interact with my devices over 100,000 times when it was blocked. And Amazon nearly 300,000 times.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: But with Facebook it was just 15,000 times, which is not that much. That might have just been me opening the Instagram account a few times by accident. So they do have trackers all over the web, they have Facebook Pixel, and the Facebook Like button. Pixel, I think is the one that causes a lot of anxiety for people because they'll be on their work computer and they'll be looking at some shoes and then later they'll be on their phones, scrolling through Instagram and they see an ad for those shoes and they're like, \"How does it know? Must be listening to my conversations.\"\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yes, by the way, people are convinced that they're listening, are they?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: No. I mean, I don't think so. We just talked about how you asked Facebook what it's doing and it won't tell the truth so who knows.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That is exactly the reality vortex I'm describing because I've had multiple people be like, \"Oh dude, they're listening to your phone, dude. What are you a child? How na\u00efve are you?\" I'm like, \"I don't think they are and if they are, that hasn't been established or reported.\" But what the hell do I know?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: I'm 88 percent certain that they're not listening or no one's listening. I did work with some researchers who tried to study this. They set up a whole bunch of phones with apps that were running all the time and they're just trying to measure whether the microphone ever got secretly activated by any of these phones or any of these apps. And they discovered other creepy things of course. But they didn't see any evidence that there's secret microphone activation happening. Though I'm always impressed or I'm always horrified 'cause people are so convinced that their phones are listening. And yet, they have it on their bedside table at night while they're having sex and take it into the bathroom. And I'm like, if you think your phone's spying on you, maybe you should put it away.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I just got to rack up those likes on my tweet. I gotta see what I tweeted. I got to see if everyone's liking my tweet. I mean, that's part of it. I mean, so to me there's two aspects to this sort of grand takeaways. I mean, my big takeaway is, I don't know if I believe what I'm about to say but it's a possibility, Amazon is a utility that should be nationalized? Maybe Google is too, it should not be the case that a private company has that much power or is that intimately woven into the infrastructure of contemporary life?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I mean, in the real world, the government built our roads and to a certain extent like powers our transportation system and our airports. And oversees the energy industry as extremely regulated. The digital world is huge now. We spend, it's sad but I think we spend almost as much time in the digital world as in the real world. Increasingly the borders between the two are gone. And the digital world, the internet has been built mostly by these private companies and they control the roads. They built the roads. They control the transportation systems.\n\nI think when you start looking at it that way and you realize the degree to which they built and controlled in infrastructure of our online environments and our digital environments, I find the argument that they're utilities and should regulated like utilities pretty powerful.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: But that was not my takeaway of, weirdly enough, of your reporting on Facebook and Apple, which are both incredibly present in one's life and in some ways, the thing we're talking about on the consumer end, is our addiction to them. And one of the revelatory things about your reporting is that there's the front facing consumer side and then there's the backend side, which you don't know anything about. And in many cases, it's way more ubiquitous and more difficult to get rid of and those are kind of different aspects of the problem. Is that fair to say?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, in terms of where I landed with this experiment and what I've been thinking about is a lot of critics are asking the question right now, the degree to which these companies are monopolies. And I really felt that with some of the blocks. When I was blocking Facebook products, because Facebook owns Facebook and Instagram, they own the spaces where my community is, where all my friend are. And so I lost the ability during those weeks to communicate with my friends and share news with them and get news from them.\n\nOne of my friends had a baby. And I didn't find out, she's one of my closest friends and I didn't find out until days later when I turned my Facebook account back on. I called her about it and she was like, \"Well, I just assumed if I put something on Facebook, everybody will see it.\" But there's this question whether they're monopolies and where the anti-trust scrutiny is in today's world and I think these companies combined have bought over 400 companies and start-ups in the last decade. Regulators in the U.S. haven't pushed back at all. It's been different in Europe. Europe has been more critical, they had this big fine against Google because of the way that it bought Android, the Android operating system, which 80% of the smartphone market uses.\n\nAnd then said, \"Hey, you need to bundle our apps up and put them on the phones by default.\" And Europe said, \"Hey, that's troubling from an anti-trust standpoint.\" So there's the regulation question. And on the other side, there's just the technologist solution. The question of why isn't there more interoperability between these platforms. When you get a phone number with a certain phone carrier, you're not locked into that phone carrier for the rest of your life. And you can call people who have numbers with different phone carriers.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Thank god.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: It's amazing, right?\n\nCHRIS HAYES: What a miracle.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: What if AT&T and Verizon, if they just been able to lock us into their system.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, sorry.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: You can only call other people who had Verizon. So technologists are kinda like, \"Why isn't there more technology platforms that are interoperable?\" I don't want to be on Facebook, I'm okay to be on Pinterest. Can I be invited to a Facebook event? Technologists are saying, \"Let's just go back to open source and make it decentralized and make everything interoperable.\" And then, the policy people are like, \"We need to regulate. We need to treat these companies as monopolies and we need to ensure that we're creating a marketplace with viable competition.\" And so, I kind of see that there's these two different paths with critics that maybe will just continue to be ignored but who knows.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: My takeaway was, in some ways they don't act anywhere near as terribly as they could. That's what I kept thinking. The idea that Amazon has in its power, it probably would be against the law, I think it would probably be a very clear tripwire for an anti-trust case, if they started messing with Netflix's streaming because they want to advantage Amazon video. But there seems to be less of that, than I would have anticipated. Partly it seems a little bit of a \"Clash of the Titans\" kind of thing. There's all these big companies, they're all more powerful than us.\n\nBut they're also in fighting each other in ways that do restrain their behavior in certain ways that as I read through your piece, I kept thinking, \"Wow, Google could screw over Yelp by turning off their maps? If they really got into it.\" They're not acting as predatorily as they could, I guess is my point.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Right, they could take more advantage of the power and data they have. I mean, we saw this happen very recently with Apple. I mean, Apple got mad-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yes, exactly.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: That Google and Facebook had used their kind of special all seeing powers. This corporate enterprise certificate. That you\u2019re only supposed to use with your employees with an app that you're distributing internally. They used this power for apps that they were using to spy on research participants, including teens. And so TechCrunch reported this and people got really upset. And Apple didn't like that they'd done this and so just overnight they pulled this enterprise certificate. Facebook and Google apparently was complete chaos because their internal apps didn't work anymore. So they didn't know what was for lunch in cafeteria and they couldn't book a spot on the Google and Facebook buses. And you saw how powerful it is. It was like, oh, that's a reminder, Apple controls the rails of how these things work and they can just say-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Nope.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: That's not working anymore. When it happens in that way, it's really visible. I mean, I can't say with certainty that they haven't abused the powers that they have. The one thing I noticed in ... Lina Khan did this kind of blockbuster academic paper, blockbuster by academic standards about how Amazon's already a monopoly. And one of the things she mentioned in it, is that, AWS is probably collecting valuable metadata, and it could be ... Amazon is always entering new industries and it's gathering data that could be helpful to it in entering new industries. And one example of them, actually using that data was that they've invested in three start-ups, that they saw because they were hosting them on AWS that they were doing tons of traffic.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: So they basically saw that they were having gangbusters growth and they said, \"Oh, we should invest in these start-ups.\"\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: So they have used the metadata from AWS in the past and that became reported, they could have just hidden that and said, we just decided to invest in these companies. I don't know how else they're using that data and I asked Amazon about it. And they just didn't respond.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I should tell people that the series is up at Gizmodo, and you have articles and then you have videos that are on YouTube, of course, owned by-\n\nKASHMIR HILL: They're on our site, they're on YouTube, they're on Facebook. They're on all these platforms that I'm criticizing.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Sit there and download some Amazon Prime Video of Kashmir Hill. There's an interesting human part of those videos, your child only likes three movies, which she can't watch during the week that you're not using Amazon because you can't stream video. Was there some kind of, for lack of a better word, spiritual lesson you learned about you as human being and your psyche and soul in relationship to technology?\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I mean so by blocking the tech giants, as we've talked about, they kind of control the infrastructure of so much of the web and so many other devices. So by blocking the tech giants, I blocked technology writ large from my life in many ways. And it was wonderful. It was the digital equivalent of going on a juice cleanse. Where, I just reevaluated the role of technology in my life. I deleted stupid time wasting apps on my phone.\n\nI turn off my phone at night, like at 8:00 or 9:00 p.m., I just turn it off, which I used to never do. My phone would be on until the battery died. And that would be a very traumatic event. So now I turn off my phone at night. It's not the first thing I reach for in the morning. Whereas before I touch my husband, before I talked to my daughter, I would I just pick the phone up as soon as I woke up and start scrolling through it. I realized I actually hate that. I don't want to start my day every day mainlining the internet through this technology that has been forced upon me by the tech giants in the world that they're creating.\n\nI don't want to look at screens as much and I don't think we have to adopt all the technology that's being pushed at us by these tech giants and other companies. I think we really need to actively resist it because it's easy. I mean, it's so easy just to stare at screen and not be where you are, not be with the people that are around you. I guess that was my big realization. On the personal level, during the last day of my block, we were flying to New York. It's a five hour flight from California and we usually, we fly a lot with my daughter. And we usually just have an iPad and set her up in front of it. In the lead up to this, my husband was like, \"Okay, you have to end your block early. We need the iPad.\"\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, what's the policy there? She's not writing an article for Gizmodo. We gotta sit on a flight here.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: He's like, \"It's not you using the iPad, it's me using the iPad.\" And I was like, \"No, no, we have to do this, I want to stay strong.\" He's like, \"I'm moving, I'm gonna sit somewhere else on the plane.\" I held strong. We read books, we played with these little Wizzle sticks that sticky sticks for an hour that came with her Alaska Airlines meal. She slept for the last hour and a half, which she usually doesn't do when she has an iPad to stimulate her. And we landed and we get in the taxi and my husband turns to me and he says, \"That was the easiest flight we've ever had.\"\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow. I\u2019m a convert. I just threw my iPhone in the garbage here. It's done. I just tossed it.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Just turn it off every once in awhile. Just turn it off.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Why are you in my life! No. Kashmir Hill is an investigative reporter at Gizmodo. She just did this amazing series we were discussing about blocking the tech giants. It's such a smart conceit and it's so well conceived and I really thank you for making the time to talk.\n\nKASHMIR HILL: Thank you for popularizing it on your show, I appreciate it.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Once again, great thanks to Kashmir Hill, investigative reporter at Gizmodo.

I didn't realize that there were millions of people \u2014 mostly millions of women \u2014 who suffered from domestic violence. I never even realized that I was a victim.\n\nWhen it happened, over 25 years ago, things like what happened to me were seen differently. People are more aware and more sensitive about domestic violence, sexual assault and marital rape than they were then. And especially right now, people are looking at situations like mine through the lens of the Me Too movement. We have broken the stigma against talking about violence against women, and I hope that we will be able to talk even more. We have come a long way, and done a lot, but there's still so much more to be done for people to understand how domestic violence works.\n\nI agreed to participate in the documentary about my case to shine a light on the issues of domestic violence, sexual assault and martial rape for future generations, to help people understand what really happened. And I think the documentary does show both how terrible and traumatizing it can be for a victim, and it also how aggressive and brutal the perpetrators are.\n\nI was a na\u00efve young woman then, thinking that I was looking for the American dream and, unfortunately, things didn't happen the way they were supposed to. I didn't expect my own husband to hurt me; I was never really able to comprehend why my husband was hurting me.\n\nBut I loved my husband, and believed that he would change. And, because of my religious and cultural background, I didn't believe in divorce; being divorced was taboo. All of that contributed to the cycle, where he would get triggered by something \u2014 for example, me not being able to cook his favorite meal or anything about money \u2014 and he would react to that with anger until he exploded. Then, after he'd hit me or, eventually, rape me, he would calm down, tell me that he was sorry, that he felt sorry for me, and beg for forgiveness. I'd forgive him, and we would go through this honeymoon-type period when he was calm.\n\nAnd then it would start all over again: Something would trigger him again, and so it began again. It was a psychological conditioning: I was traumatized by the violence, unable to understand and being asked to forgive the person I loved. He would beg for forgiveness, and I would accept his forgiveness, and then hope that he would change and never do it again. But that, of course, never happened; on the contrary, it escalated.\n\nAt one point, I tried to leave, but I couldn't. He usually said to me, \"If you ever leave, then I will follow you and I will kill you.\" To me, those were very strong words coming from my husband; I was scared that he really would do it. And, I didn't have anywhere to go; I couldn't jeopardize my friends, because I knew that he would follow me and maybe hurt my friends.\n\nI called 911 many times, but the dispatcher didn't even know how to help me because, back then, we were just starting to learn about about domestic violence. Besides which, my husband said that, if I called the police and told them that he threatened me, he would kick me out of the country, or that the police were going to kick me out of the country.\n\n(That happens still today: A lot of the crimes against immigrant women get under-reported because of their vulnerability in this country. They're afraid to talk or call the police because they feel threatened twice.)\n\nI can't turn back time; I can't rewind anything. But I've learned that silence is not an option. It is important to be able to talk, for people not to suffer in silence and to feel strong and feel their voices will be heard.\n\nBy talking about what happened to me, I hope to shine a light on the epidemic of domestic violence and sexual assault, but also to show that there is hope for survivors. People need to know that they are not alone \u2014 I felt very alone \u2014 and that you can get help. You can find a community of survivors and other well-trained people who can actually help if you in a bad situation.\n\nTake the Domestic Violence Hotline, a whole community of people who are willing to help the victims of domestic violence. It is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year; they can translate calls in more than 200 languages or chat online in both English and Spanish.\n\nBy breaking my own silence, I hope that society will really understand that domestic violence is not a joke, and that sexual assault in general is not a joke. Again, 25 years ago, society was not ready to comprehend how damaging and traumatic domestic violence is, or how to help victims like me. Things have changed, definitely; there is help for women today that wasn't there for me. And I want them to know: Try to save yourself. You are important.\n\nAs told to THINK editor Megan Carpentier, edited and condensed for clarity."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/oscar-nominated-director-bing-liu-filmmaking-confronting-his-mother-why-ncna972771", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 18, 2019, 8:51 PM GMT\n\nWhen filmmaker Bing Liu started to work on his first feature documentary, \u201cMinding the Gap,\u201d he didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d end up in the film.

Spoiler alert: The book\u2019s title \u2014 which compresses the words \u201cthreat,\u201d \u201cterror\u201d and \u201cTrump\u201d into one breath \u2014 is a clue.\n\nMcCabe served America as an FBI special agent for over 20 years, working his way along an arduous career path from organized crime in New York to counterterrorism and high-value detainee interrogations to his eventual appointments as deputy director and then acting director. Among other high-profile cases he worked on, McCabe helped secure the arrest of Ahmed Abu Khattala for suspected involvement in the 2012 Benghazi attack.\n\nMany FBI agents have written books filled with war stories or tales espousing the rewards of public service. Yet, few FBI leaders have felt that they had to write a book.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I know Andrew McCabe. I served alongside McCabe for a short period at FBI headquarters; he led the counterterrorism division and I headed up counterintelligence. We were colleagues but not friends, in large part because the crushing work hours typically left little time for socializing. But we both sat through countless early morning briefings of then-FBI Director Robert Mueller. During these times I observed McCabe to be quiet, calm, smart and dedicated.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nMany FBI agents have written books filled with war stories or tales espousing the rewards of public service. Yet, few FBI leaders have felt that they had to write a book. McCabe is writing a book for the same reasons that James Comey seems to have written a book; because he feels he must tell his side of the story and counter the withering barrage of taunting he and his family has endured from our bully of a president. \"Yet now the rule of law is under attack, including from the President himself,\u201d he writes.\n\nNo FBI agent wants to have to appear on national television to share what are typically guarded and private processes. We are all secretive and private about our work by nature and by protocol. It is not in our DNA to publicly recount sensitive discussions and decision-making at the highest levels of our institutions. Knowing what I know about FBI agents, and knowing what I know about Andrew McCabe, I believe this book was probably actually painful to write.\n\nFBI agents are trained to identify and mitigate threats. It\u2019s clear that McCabe was seriously concerned about a national security threat emanating directly from the Oval Office. As such, he tried to mitigate that threat. These passages paint an image of a chaotic administration made even more chaotic with the firing of the FBI director.\n\nIn an interview Sunday on CBS, \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d McCabe stated that during the days after Comey was fired, \u201cthe highest levels of American law enforcement were trying to figure out what to do with the President,\u201d even exploring the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to have Trump removed from office. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who allegedly was part of such discussions, has offered only a partial denial of such talks. The Department of Justice has disputed the account. I\u2019m convinced such discussions took place and that they reflected genuine concern that this president might be incapable of fulfilling his duties.\n\nSimilarly, McCabe asserts he was present when Rosenstein offered, multiple times, to wear \u201ca wire\u201d to record conversations with the president. The New York Times reported in September 2018 that Rosenstein proposed secretly recording Trump, a report that Rosenstein quickly denied. A Justice Department spokeswoman told the Times at the time that Rosenstein made the offer sarcastically.\n\nBut McCabe told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday that Rosenstein\u2019s offer was not just a joke and that it happened more than once. In fact, McCabe deemed it \u201cso serious that he took it to the lawyers at the FBI to discuss it.\u201d The fact that the deputy attorney general of the United States would talk of secretly recording the U.S. president, seemingly to capture conversations related to the obstruction of on-going investigations, and/or to gather evidence that the president was unfit for duty, shows there were indeed deep concerns about Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nShockingly, as excerpted in the Washington Post, McCabe recounts an Oval Office briefing in July 2017, wherein the president refused to believe a U.S. intelligence report that North Korea had test-fired an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. Trump dismissed this intelligence as a \u201choax\u201d because Russian President Vladimir Putin told him North Korea lacked that capacity. To a trained senior FBI agent and lawyer like McCabe, this would have fueled further concern that a president whose potential ties to Russian agents was already under suspicion, was relying on and receiving disinformation from the head of our most formidable adversary.\n\nIn McCabe\u2019s telling, he was seriously concerned that obstruction of the Mueller probe was happening or could happen.\n\nIn McCabe\u2019s telling, he was seriously worried that obstruction of the Mueller probe was happening or could happen. In his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, McCabe said that fearing he might be fired, he moved to try and ensure the \u201cRussia case was on solid ground.\u201d He took steps to make it tougher for anyone to end the investigation if he was removed. Specifically, McCabe said he ordered an obstruction of justice investigation of the president. This additional obstruction component would have added a layer of protection to the Russian case in that someone trying to close the investigation would have had to prove that decision was not intended to obstruct, or aid the president in obstructing, the broader investigation.\n\nOf course, McCabe\u2019s fears about his job were warranted. He was fired from the FBI a mere 26 hours before he could have retired with an FBI pension. This firing was the result of a DOJ Inspector General inquiry that recommended McCabe be fired for an unauthorized media disclosure and for lacking candor on four occasions. I led an adjudication unit in the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility and was responsible for disciplinary decisions in cases of serious misconduct. I later served as the FBI\u2019s chief inspector, investigating and reviewing sensitive personnel and program performance issues. In the hundreds of internal investigations that I\u2019ve handled, I never saw an FBI employee fired within 26 hours of retirement. In my experience, employees in similar situations were typically allowed to stay on, sometimes under suspension, until retirement eligibility kicked in.\n\nThe fact that McCabe may have lacked candor during an inquiry troubles me greatly, but the circumstances around his firing trouble me even more and give rise to concern that the White House or attorney general put their thumbs on the scale of justice when it came to decisions of what to do with McCabe. Importantly, even if the lack of candor allegations were valid, we need to take notice of McCabe\u2019s verifiable observations and accounts. He\u2019s sounding an alarm and we need to listen."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-emergency-declaration-may-have-laid-groundwork-his-impeachment-ncna972801", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 18, 2019, 6:59 PM GMT By Michael Conway, Former counsel, U.S. House Judiciary Committee\n\nThe Founding Fathers pointed to the impeachment power of Congress, through which a president could be removed from office for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d as the path to rein in a president encroaching on congressional power.\n\nIn 1788\u2019s Federalist 66, for instance, Alexander Hamilton wrote that \u201cthe powers relating to impeachments are, as before intimated, an essential check in the hands of [Congress] upon the encroachments of the executive.\u201d\n\nIn Federalist 65, Hamilton described as impeachable \u201cthose offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d\n\nNo greater abuse of a public trust can be envisioned than the president usurping the power of Congress.\n\nThat, however, is precisely what President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration Friday of a national emergency, in order to commandeer billions of dollars that Congress refused to appropriate to build a wall on the southern border, did. It is the constitutional role of Congress to appropriate (or, in this case, refuse to appropriate) public funds for a specific purpose. Congress voted not to fund $8 billion to build a wall, earmarking only $1.375 billion for that project; Trump\u2019s announcement is an effort to usurp their constitutional authority.\n\nAs expected, the announcement promptly generated the first of several expected lawsuits challenging his declaration. But asking the judicial system to check Trump\u2019s hijacking of the constitutional power of Congress is the wrong tactic and is likely to fail.\n\nThe dismal prospect for obtaining a permanent court-ordered ban on the president\u2019s unilateral transfer of funds to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d is revealed by the deference the Supreme Court last year displayed in upholding Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\nIn approving the ban, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the challengers' \"request for a searching inquiry into the persuasiveness of the president\u2019s justifications is inconsistent with the broad statutory text and the deference traditionally accorded the president\" in matters of national security and international affairs.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s language then promises only a perfunctory review of the basis for a national emergency: Because the president has declared a national emergency to build a wall, the Supreme Court majority appears ready to accept that subjective label at face value even if no emergency objectively exists.\n\nBut federal courts have long indicated that they don\u2019t feel it is their role to question certain presidential decisions. In a prescient warning more than four decades ago, a federal appeals court cautioned that the courts would not second-guess even the most outrageous presidential invocation of a national emergency.\n\nAfter President Richard Nixon declared a national emergency in 1971 over America\u2019s financial reserves and then imposed an extra 10 percent surcharge on certain imports, Yoshida International sued to declare the action invalid and won at the federal trial court level. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (now part of the federal Circuit Court in D.C.) reversed the trial court\u2019s decision and issued this chilling prediction about the scope of presidential authority and its potential abuse by a future president.\n\n\u201cThough such a broad grant may be considered unwise, or even dangerous, should it come into the hands of an unscrupulous, rampant president, willing to declare an emergency when none exists, the wisdom of a congressional delegation is not for us to decide,\u201d said the decision.\n\nQuoting an earlier decision, Chief Judge Markey wrote: \u201cWe are not concerned with their wisdom. The question before the court is one of power, not of policy.\"\n\nThat flagrant abuse of power now has come to pass: Trump has declared an immigration national emergency even though his own government\u2019s data proves that none exists. But while the Supreme Court may find that Trump has the power to hijack those funds to fulfill a campaign promise, Congress can also find that this is an abuse of power warranting his impeachment. Indeed, the Founders envisioned the power of impeachment as the fit remedy if the executive branch usurped congressional power.\n\nThere is precedent for this.\n\nPresident Nixon technically had the power to fire the special prosecutor investigating him, the power to pardon those involved and the power to oversee the FBI and CIA in connection with the Watergate investigation. The existence of his power was not questioned; the abuse of that power, however, was found to be an impeachable offense.\n\nIn July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee adopted three Articles of Impeachment against President Richard Nixon; Article II, which passed 28-10, alleged an abuse of power by the president. In its final report, the committee stated: \u201cFor just such presidential misconduct the impeachment power was included in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn a clarion call to the present, the committee declared that the abuse of power impeachment article was needed, lest a future president use his authority \u201cfor further usurpations of the power of other branches of our government. By adopting this article, the committee seeks to prevent the recurrence of any such abuse of presidential power.\u201d\n\nBy defying Congress and unconstitutionally allocating federal monies for a project that Congress refused to fund, Trump has abused presidential power just as Judiciary Committee condemned almost 45 years ago.\n\nImpeachment was the appropriate remedy then, as it is now."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/lebron-james-better-michael-jordan-why-stats-alone-can-t-ncna972646", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 18, 2019, 12:12 AM GMT / Updated Feb. 18, 2019, 12:43 AM GMT By Jalal Baig\n\nNowadays, few issues can stir up basketball fans quite like the increasing comparisons being made between LeBron James and Michael Jordan. James is a seemingly unstoppable force, not matter what team he's on; Jordan is the man long regarded to be basketball\u2019s symbol of modern \u2014 not to mention commercial \u2014 greatness.\n\nSunday\u2019s NBA All-Star Game provides another opportunity to grapple with this question when James captains one of the teams this year.\n\nFor his part, James hasn\u2019t exactly stayed silent on this debate. Indeed, a few weeks ago on an episode of the ESPN+ series More Than An Athlete, James reflected on the implications of his 2016 NBA title, which ended a 52-year championship drought for the hapless Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThere are many ways to appraise Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Depending on what statistics or achievements you are tallying, answers vary.\n\n\u201cAnd then after I stopped, I was like \u2014 that one right there made you the greatest player of all time,\u201d James said. \u201cEverybody was just talking \u2014 how [the Warriors] were the greatest team of all time, like it was the greatest team ever assembled. And for us to come back, you know, the way we came back in that fashion, I was like, 'You did, you did something special.'\u201d\n\nThere are many ways to appraise Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Depending on what statistics or achievements you are tallying, answers vary.\n\nHowever, by one significant metric, the answer seems more apparent. As Howard Bryant writes in his book, \u201cThe Heritage,\u201d James has courageously made \u201cunequivocal support for black America inseparable from his public persona\u201d and become an advocate for a cause long abandoned by black athletes. By embracing the struggle for social justice at a moment of sizable political polarization, he has encouraged the voice of others and cemented his legacy for posterity. Michael Jordan, in comparison, gave primacy to corporate interests. So while Jordan\u2019s statistics and trophy vault are impressive, he falls behind when you look at the bigger picture.\n\nFor the uninitiated, James was designated Michael Jordan\u2019s heir even before he had attended his senior prom. The basketball wunderkind began to make national ripples as a teenager when Sports Illustrated \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d on its cover and ESPN televised his high school games.\n\nSt. Vincent-St Mary High School basketball phenomenon LeBron James laughs with his teammates Marcus Johnson and Willie McGee during the fourth quarter against Kettering Alter High School at University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio on Feb. 16, 2003. St. Vincent-St Mary High School won 73-40. John Sommers II / Reuters file\n\nJordan\u2019s case for greatest of all time rests on his considerable individual accolades, six championship, and the fact that he never lost a series in the NBA Finals. While James has won fewer titles (three), he has made the finals for eight consecutive years, will almost assuredly accumulate higher career totals in major statistical categories and is clearly on par, if not better, according to advanced comparisons of both players (Player Efficiency Rating and Value Over Replacement Player). Plus, James\u2019 collective performances in the 2016 Finals \u2014 against a vaunted and historic Golden State Warriors team \u2014 arguably trump Jordan's individual playoff brilliance.\n\nHere's the thing, though: Jordan\u2019s story now endures mainly through his Air Jordan shoes, memes and YouTube highlights. James\u2019s tale only begins on the hardwood. As Michael Eric Dyson appropriately notes in his book, \u201cWhat Truth Sounds Like,\u201d James is a black athlete who has parlayed his accolades, trophies and galactic superstardom to \u201cstep out of character and break the mythology of a raceless and neutral American identity.\u201d\n\nThe fact is that athletes are some of the most consequential and affluent black employees in the United States. This has been true throughout history: While the vital contributions of many black doctors, lawyers, scientists and intellectuals were impeded by segregation, black Americans penetrated the white mainstream through sport.\n\nThis privilege of being the \u201cones who made it,\u201d as Howard Bryant puts it, came with responsibility, however. Sportsmen like Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos embraced the tradition, which is informally termed \u201cthe Heritage\u201d by Bryant. But as the financial and political stakes changed, so did the black athlete\u2019s desire for expressing outrage publicly let alone political engagement.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar, an NBA legend in his own right, has said Jordan chose \u201ccommerce over conscience.\u201d Certainly, the Chicago Bulls star was not known for his actions or voice off the court.\n\nIn 1990, Jordan refused to endorse black North Carolinian (Jordan\u2019s home state) and Democrat Harvey Gantt in his senate race against incumbent Jesse Helms, who was described by David Broder in 2001 as \u201cthe last prominent unabashed white racist politician in this country.\u201d The former Chicago Bull stayed mum in 1992 when the Los Angeles riots erupted after the Rodney King verdict. He also chose to remain silent on the paucity of black coaches in the NBA, on the reports of kids literally murdering other kids to procure his signature shoes and on the children used in sweatshops to produce his shoe line.\n\nThe few public statements Jordan has made since his retirement have been relatively uninspiring. As Michael Eric Dyson summarizes, \u201cduring his playing days, he was depressingly silent about the injustices that plagued his people, and now, tentatively, he speaks up when the terms are uncontroversial, his reputation safe.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nJames, too, hasn\u2019t always been a perfect role model. And there have been some notable lapses \u2014 his silence when given the chance to speak out on the Darfur genocide and Tamir Rice shooting come to mind. But through the years in the spotlight, he has slowly but surely found his footing The (now) Los Angeles Laker star has taken an unambiguous stance on racial injustice and police brutality, challenged President Donald Trump\u2019s divisive governance on Twitter, supported Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protest against police brutality, crucified NFL owners for their \u201cslave mentality,\u201d and called for the ouster of Los Angeles Clipper owner Donald Sterling after his racist comments.\n\nThis past summer, he opened the I Promise School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where the black poverty rate is 28 percent. The school\u2019s ambitious plan is to not only educate its students, but to also improve all facets of their lives.\n\nLeBron James addresses the crowd during the opening ceremonies of the I Promise School on July 30, 2018 in Akron, Ohio Jason Miller / Getty Images file\n\nAnd despite being told to \u201cshut up and dribble\u201d last year by Laura Ingraham of Fox News, James has not allowed the potential loss of income or endorsements to change his behavior. \u201cI do this because this is bigger than me personally,\u201d he told ESPN\u2019s Undefeated.\n\nNow, through his multimedia platform Uninterrupted, James is turning towards Hollywood and the entertainment industry in an attempt to use his clout to provide others with a platform to speak out also. As Bryant writes, the task here is simple: \u201cBeing a politically active black athlete should no longer be considered radical, but commonplace.\u201d\n\nThese are all the hallmarks of the kind of greatness that cannot be evaluated merely through NBA championships and Most Valuable Player awards alone. James has plenty of those honors, of course. But unlike Michael Jordan, he has also wielded his individual brand to achieve something far greater and meaningful than sneakers."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/msnbc-hosts-covering-trumps-false-claims-americans-need-border-security-ncna972446", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 18, 2019, 12:35 AM GMT / Updated Feb. 18, 2019, 12:39 AM GMT\n\nDid you see what Joe & Chris, Ari, Rachel, Nicolle and Chris had to say on MSNBC?

After reluctantly signing a bipartisan spending bill that allocated $1.37 billion for new fencing, the president announced he would redirect over $6 billion in federal funds to build hundreds of additional miles of steel barrier to address the so-called immigration crisis and fulfill his otherwise failed campaign promise. He then flew to his Mar-a-Lago club, which has allegedly hired undocumented immigrants, for a weekend of golf.\n\nAt 1:24 p.m. on Friday afternoon, Aurora, Illinois police received reports of an active shooter at the Henry Pratt Company. An employee about to be terminated used a handgun to shoot and kill five people, wounding six others. The shooting occurred the day after the one year anniversary of the Parkland school shooting, where a former student of Stoneman Douglas High School used an AR-15 to shoot and kill 17 people on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nThree hours after Trump somewhat incoherently notified the nation of what many experts agree is not really a national emergency, an actual, tangible, devastating emergency happened. Again.\n\nThree hours after Trump somewhat incoherently notified the nation of what many experts agree is not really a national emergency, an actual emergency happened.\n\nIllegal border crossings and apprehensions have been declining for nearly two decades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and in 2017 were at their lowest point since 1971. A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry. In other words, this president has manufactured an immigration crisis for his own political gain, hoping that a fear of \"the other\u201d will help him win reelection in 2020.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\n\u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time,\u201d Trump said during his Rose Garden speech. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this, but I want to do it faster.\u201d By the president\u2019s own admission this national emergency isn\u2019t necessary. It\u2019s just convenient.\n\nBut there are very real national emergencies this president has yet to address and, in many cases, that may have actually been worsened by his policies, rhetoric and political endorsements. Gun violence is one of them, as the most recent shooting tragically made clear. A reported 40,000 people died in shootings last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the highest number of deaths since 1968. From 2012 to 2014, an average of 1,297 children died from gun-related injuries. But this president can\u2019t even tweet the words \u201cgun violence\u201d on the anniversary of one of the deadliest mass shootings in America, choosing instead to describe the Parkland shooting as \u201cschool violence.\u201d\n\nThe National Rifle Association spent more than $21 million to help Trump get elected, and at the organization's 2018 convention in Dallas, Trump promised to defend gun rights. After the shooting in Aurora, Illinois, Trump sent his \u201cheartfelt condolences to all of the victims and their families.\u201d\n\nA reported one in five women will be the victim of a completed or attempted rape in her lifetime, according to the CDC. That's a real national emergency. The same CDC report reveals around 50 million U.S women experience some kind of sexual violence in a year. Yet we have a president who has been accused of sexual assault or harassment by over 20 women, who endorsed a man accused of pedophilia and who has defended at least six men accused of sexual assault while in office. The National Sexual Assault Hotline saw a 35 percent increase in calls after Trump bragged about sexual assault on tape, and a 201 percent increase in calls during Trump\u2019s Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing.\n\nThe United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any developed nation, and black women are three to four times more likely to die during childbirth than white women. That's a real national emergency. But Trump has tried and failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on three separate occasions, which could\u2019ve stripped health care from an estimated 24 million people by the year 2021 and made pregnancy and postpartum depression pre-existing conditions. Meanwhile, states with the highest number of abortion restrictions tend to have the worst women and children\u2019s healthoutcomes, according to a 2017 report by the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, but this president vowed to elect Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade and is being hailed by some as the most \u201cpro-life president ever.\u201d\n\nThe country has also been experiencing a rise in hate crimes since 2016, according to the FBI. That's a real national emergency. There were more than 7,100 hate crimes reported in 2017, with an increase in attacks motivated by race, religion and sexual orientation. Yet this president believes neo-Nazis chanting \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d are potentially fine people, has rolled back protections for transgender Americans and wants to allow people to discriminate under the guise of religious freedom. The president has attacked black athletes protesting systemic racism and relied on racist tropes to verbally assault prominent Democrats \u2014 is it any wonder a recent study found an increase in school bullying in areas that voted for Trump in 2016?\n\nAnd looming over all of us is the very real threat of climate change. In just 12 years the world could experience extreme drought, flooding and heat, resulting in failed economies and extreme poverty. The Pentagon has stated that climate change poses a national security threat, and the U.S. government concluded that the U.S. economy could lose 10 percent of its GDP and thousands could die if climate change isn\u2019t slowed down or reversed. But this president has called global warming a hoax, openly mocks science on Twitter, has worked tirelessly to reverse President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental rules reducing air-pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nThese are the real national emergencies plaguing our country and making life more dangerous for a significant number of Americans. These are the real national emergencies this president should be focused on fighting. Conservative pundit and provocateur Anne Coulter said on Friday \"the only national emergency is that our president is an idiot.\" The way things are going, she may have a point.\n\nAt the same time, Trump's misuse of executive power sets a powerful new precedent, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted. \u201cA Democrat president can declare emergencies as well,\u201d Pelosi said on Friday.

With a career characterized by sheer tenacity and improbable comebacks, Vonn is considered by many to be the greatest women\u2019s skier of all time \u2014 and the greatest U.S. skier of either gender \u2014 and her impact on the American skiing program will be felt for generations to come.\n\nAlpine skiing is a sport historically dominated by Europeans, but the last decade has seen the U.S. emerge as a powerhouse, largely on the backs \u2014 or rather, knees \u2014 of Vonn and Bode Miller. When Vonn won the first of her four FIS World Cup championships in 2008, she became just the second American woman and fourth American overall to capture that title. When she became the first American woman to win gold in the downhill at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, the most successful U.S. skiers before her were Tamara McKinney and Picabo Street, with only Street garnering any serious level of fame.\n\nWith a career characterized by sheer tenacity and improbable comebacks, Vonn is widely considered to be the greatest women\u2019s skier of all time.\n\nAlong with Miller, Vonn\u2019s electricity down the hill propelled her to a celebrity status previously unoccupied by American skiers. But instead of playing it safe, Vonn used her platform to speak openly about topics other athletes often shied away from, including mental health and gender equality. She talked often about her friendship with Street, a mentor, and how she hoped to help inspire and empower girls. She didn\u2019t want to be viewed as the best female skier \u2014 she wanted to be one of the best skiers, period \u2014 regardless of gender. As Five Thirty Eight\u2019s Neil Paine notes, at the height of her career Vonn \u201cposted speeds comparable to those of the top male racers,\u201d and repeatedly stated she wanted to race against men.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nShe didn\u2019t have to, of course. Vonn\u2019s legacy is secure, having transformed the sport in the last decade. She did so with a mix of speed, stubbornness and risk-taking that bordered on recklessness. The nature of the sport \u2014 in particular Vonn\u2019s signature events, the downhill and the super-G, the fastest of the Alpine disciplines \u2014 requires the skier to shift speeds quickly as they ski both straight downhill and sideways, between gates.\n\nVonn did that faster and more skillfully than those before her. But she also paid for the risks she took, suffering several dangerous crashes that would likely have pushed other athletes to retire years earlier. In 2006, she was airlifted off a mountain during a downhill training run at the Turin Games. She was back on the slopes two days later, finishing eighth. In 2010, 10 days before the Vancouver Games, she crashed during a slalom practice run, severely bruising her right shin to the point that she could barely walk. She went on to win the gold in the downhill and the bronze in the super-G.\n\nIn February 2013, Vonn crashed during the super-G at the World Championships, tearing the ACL and MCL in her right knee and fracturing her tibia. She tried to come back later that year but tore her repaired ACL, forcing her to miss the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. The years following saw multiple injuries as Vonn attempted comeback after comeback. Some might call this reckless; others call this \u201cfearless.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s Olympics in Pyeongchang was the poignant culmination of a stellar career. After breaking her knee and her arm in 2016, Vonn fought her way back to qualify for the games. Though she finished sixth in the super-G, she completed her comeback with a bronze medal in the downhill, becoming the oldest woman to medal in an Olympic Alpine skiing event.\n\nVonn officially announced her retirement on February 1 \u2014 10 days before her last competition. She crashed in her second-to-last race, the super-G, bruising a rib and suffering a black eye. And then, like she had time and again, Vonn got back up. Five days later, she took the bronze in the downhill at the World Championships \u2014 the final race of her career.\n\nVonn crashes during the FIS World Ski Championships Women's Super G in Sweden on February 5, 2019.

Vonn was one of those exceptions.\n\nSo the next time you see Mikaela Shiffrin slalom her way to another medal, or the next time you see a women\u2019s event overtake the men\u2019s in both coverage and ratings, remember Lindsey Vonn. As Jane McManus pointed out in the New York Daily News, 24 million people watched Vonn take the bronze in last year\u2019s Olympics on NBC, and it was the first Olympics in which women\u2019s sports were given more primetime coverage than men\u2019s. \u201cNot only did NBC follow the medals,\u201d McManus wrote, \u201cit followed the athletes that viewers were invested in.\u201d\n\nFor more than a decade, we\u2019ve been invested in Vonn\u2019s breathtaking career. We\u2019ve watched with awe and, at times, fear, as she\u2019s zoomed down hills and climbed mountains to compete in the sport she loves. Sports clich\u00e9s are a dime a dozen, but Vonn truly deserves them. Because that\u2019s who she is: gritty, fearless, reckless, one of the greatest of all time."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/diet-fast-weight-loss-pipe-dream-so-why-do-we-ncna972266", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 16, 2019, 5:18 PM GMT By Erika Nicole Kendall\n\nThere will always be someone ready to profit off the desperation of consumers, and that is precisely what any given get-thin-fast scheme intends to do. Whether it is a bottle of caffeine pills masquerading as fat burners, a series of drinks masquerading as a \u201cdetoxification system\" or a multi-level marketing system so egregious that the FTC had to step in and levy fines against its creator, there is always someone looking to convince a person with a weight loss goal that there is an \u201ceasy\u201d way to do it, and \u2014 for a load of cash, of course \u2014 they\u2019ll show you how.\n\nThe scams are alluring because they\u2019re promising something that can rarely be accomplished in real life: Weight loss with minimal effort.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to accept the truth because, to our eyes, the weight gain happened with minimal effort \u2014 a pound here, a pound there. Combined with an increasingly sedentary lifestyle and a slowly decreasing metabolism that accompanies getting older, there is a sense that it should \u201cfall off\u201d as effortlessly as it came on.\n\nThis sense that weight loss should be effortless is magnified by persistent social obsession with thinness. Not only do we, as a culture, give unearned privileges and benefits to people simply because they are thin, but we also treat being overweight as a personal failure. A larger sized body is treated like its own scarlet letter.\n\nGet-thin-quick schemes, which often manage to be excessively expensive as well as requiring extreme degrees of deprivation and unsustainable amounts of exercise, then seem like a way to rid ourselves of the vestiges of our sins and suffer for having committed them. There is this notion that remarkable results can be had, and that perhaps what\u2019s wrong with us is that we haven\u2019t gone far enough to get them.\n\nWhat starts out as, at best, a search for the right answers to a healthy lifestyle turns into a desperate feeling of being willing to do anything to just lose the weight. Maybe we do need to \u201csuffer,\u201d we think. Maybe we do need to go to remarkable lengths in order to achieve that success of \"thinness.\" Perhaps we just need to give up chewable food for four weeks in order to see the results we crave. For too many of us, after all, that\u2019s what we did the last time we were able to make the scale move, and never mind the fact that we gained all that weight back immediately afterwards.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s most troubling about the fever pitch of weight loss dogma \u2014 and I say this as a personal trainer and nutritionist who has had a weight loss journey of my own: The people who find themselves gravitating to these get-thin fast schemes were often in the same situation before, several times over. The yo-yo dieting cycle, encouraged by the media and exacerbated by people's lack of knowledge of what a healthy diet is, results in people losing a few pounds, slowly gaining it back plus a few more pounds, and then feeling an increased pull to lose even more next time. But with each swing, they feel as if they must do more than they did before to lose slightly more weight and really keep it off.\n\nThat is where the desperation, and the pull of the get-thin-quick scam comes in.\n\nBut many of the \u201close 7 pounds in 7 days!\u201d quotes we see on the covers of magazines aren\u2019t entirely accurate, realistic, or feasible for the everyday person \u2014 much like most of our discourse around weight loss.\n\nThe diets contained in those pages can produce several-pound losses on the scale, but it\u2019s not because of something magical that took place within those seven days: Many of those diets are simply high-fiber powerhouses, offering much-needed support to people who frequently need help being \"regular\" after long periods of eating high-carbohydrate diets rich in processed foods instead of vegetables. Anyone who hasn\u2019t had a bowel movement in several days \u2014 which can happen to people who eat a lot of meat and potatoes and not a lot of salads \u2014 who then eats mostly vegetables for a week is bound to experience a drop on the scale.\n\nIt\u2019s the exact same story for the diuretic tummy teas that are flooding social media, the detoxes that promise you a \u201cslimmer waist\u201d or anything else that simply encourages you to evacuate your bowels.\n\nThe trouble is our tendency to see weight loss as a goal unto itself, instead of understanding that the goal is to define healthy living in a sustainable way that helps us avoid the yo-yo dieting cycle. We can\u2019t keep treating a diet as simply something to take on in pursuit of a weight loss goal, to be ditched when we get there.\n\nWe have to change the way we talk about weight and fitness in this country. The gym is important \u2014 not merely because it can produce weight loss, but because it helps to preserve one\u2019s quality of life. Proper nutrition is important \u2014 not because of its ability to produce weight loss, but because heart health is essential to longevity, and can be negatively impacted if we aren\u2019t careful. And yes, weight loss can happen if we change what we eat and regularly exercise, but only if we engage in it consistently as a proactive act of self-care, not in reaction to feelings of pressure after a series or lifetime of indulgences.\n\nWe have to stop viewing diet and exercise as a punishment for our prior comfort, and start seeing them as a way of achieving comfort in the long-term. Not only do our bodies suffer from this, but so do our psyches... and our wallets."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-venezuela-policy-isn-t-case-right-versus-left-ncna971236", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 16, 2019, 2:51 PM GMT By Brett Bruen, president, Global Situation Room, Inc.\n\nThe people of Venezuela are being held hostage by Nicolas Maduro. For years, he has denied them food, medicine and basic supplies. More than three million refugees have fled the country. In 2017, more than 280,000 children were found to be malnourished and at risk of dying. The situation in the country has only declined drastically and the statistics are likely far worse now. Alarmingly, the government denies there are any problems; it doesn\u2019t even allow health statistics to be officially kept.\n\nStill, we know that newborns in Syria, which is still wracked by war, are more likely to survive than those born to Venezuelan mothers; maternal mortality rose 66 percent from 2015 to 2016. The average person in the nation lost 24 pounds in 2017.Reports indicate that nearly 80 percent of hospitals lack regular access to water, 53 percent of the nation's operating rooms are shuttered and more than 70 percent of emergency rooms cannot regularly provide services to patients\n\nMaduro callously refuses to acknowledge, let alone address the suffering of his people. If America allows him to stay the course, the consequences will be catastrophic. This isn\u2019t just a political crisis. There is a humanitarian imperative to act.\n\nIt's true that American hasn't always been a good neighbor; Our relations with Latin America have often oscillated between indifference and ill-advised interventions. And on Wednesday, during a House Foreign Affairs committee hearing on U.S. policy toward Venezuela, many Democrats focused on that past and the possibility that any intervention in Venezuela could turn out as poorly as past efforts in the region.\n\nBut they all but ignored the present perilous predicament of the Venezuelan people. Our past cannot hold us back from doing what is right, and required now. Inaction is not necessarily respect; in this case, it is morally wrong and reprehensible.\n\nThe question for lawmakers should not be if, but how, we act. We have already tried strong words and sanctions, for years; Maduro and those who back him were not fazed by such traditional tactics. The European Union called for new, fair elections to be held in the country; those kind of election a Maduro-run government did not hold last year and will not now solve the crisis.\n\nWe have already tried strong words and sanctions, for years; Maduro and those who back him were not fazed by such traditional tactics.\n\nSo far, I give the Trump Administration mixed, but passing, marks on their response to the crisis; many of the steps they have taken to pressure Maduro and the military \u2014 including the diplomatic, disaster response, and denial of funds \u2014 are the right ones.\n\nThat includes recognizing Juan Guaido as head of state: The Venezuelan Constitution calls for the president of the National Assembly, in this case Guaido, to temporarily assume the highest office in the land should there be an absence of a democratically elected head of state. Recognizing him as such in the wake of a sham election isn't a coup, it\u2019s the constitution.\n\nForcing Maduro\u2019s diplomats out of the United States and transferring the government\u2019s American-held assets, like the oil company Citgo\u2019s, to Guaido were also smart moves. This cuts off a key source of funding for the regime. And Trump\u2019s team has assembled an important and impressive international coalition of over 50 countries to support Venezuela\u2019s constitution and return to democracy.\n\nTrump administration has actually emphasized the importance of human rights and democracy in this case. (The embrace of those principles has been largely absent from U.S. foreign policy toward other parts of the world recently.) And though I worked for Barack Obama, I can and should acknowledge when Donald Trump does diplomacy right. Indeed, there was a dangerous isolationist undertone in some Democrats\u2019 comments this week.\n\nThere are, however, several areas of our Venezuela policy in which I differ with the administration. First, I believe that their rhetoric is far too aggressive: John Bolton continues to taunt Maduro with tweets, while Mike Pompeo and the State Department are trying to leverage the situation in Venezuela to get some traction on their hardline against Iran. It too often echoes an era during which the United States bullied and bulldozed its way around Latin America. Trump's comments that it was \u201csocialist policies\u201d that brought about this crisis in Venezuela during the State of the Union were not helpful either.\n\nRhetoric like that makes it too easy for Maduro to paint a picture of our actions being guided by malevolent motivations; he has already, by telling the BBC that Trump is a warmonger and accusing Bolton of planning to replace him with a puppet.\n\nA stronger solution would be to let other countries, especially regional leaders, take more prominent roles in critiquing the Maduro regime and highlight the suffering of the Venezuelan people. We used this approach often when I was a diplomat posted to Africa, preferring to let the African Union play the role of chief critic (even if our performance as only a supporting actor was Oscar-worthy).\n\nBeyond the optics, a massive amount of aid is needed to counter the Maduro regime's criminal negligence. Just $20 million has been put on the table by the United States in response to the country's crisis; we need to add several zeros to that figure. And, given Maduro's history of denying his people desperately needed assistance and the scale of the suffering in Venezuela, we ought to be creating massive aid centers on the border and offer jobs there to Venezuelan soldiers who leave their posts. That would create a stark choice for officers whose loyalties are already weakened by more paltry payoffs from Maduro and the prospect of perishing for an increasingly unpopular politician.\n\nThen there is the prospect for a U.S. military intervention: Without question, we should not repeat the mistakes of the past, and thus it should be a last resort and absolutely done alongside other Latin American nations. But, as in Haiti, Panama and Kosovo, it must remain an option; we simply cannot stand idly by while parents lose their children to starvation and Pinochet-esque death squads can kill with impunity those suspected of acting against the regime.\n\nAny one of us can disagree with Trump on some, or even most, of his policies. But, he is right that the people of Venezuela need our help now.\n\nWe should continue to encourage a multilateral, multi-dimensional strategy that emphasizes aggressive diplomacy and disaster assistance. But, we cannot let partisanship or past problems prevent us from protecting those in danger, especially the hundreds of thousands of malnourished children. That would truly be an immoral legacy."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/measles-vaccine-once-again-under-attack-anti-vaccine-fearmongers-darla-ncna972306", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 15, 2019, 10:53 PM GMT By Arthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at the NYU School of Medicine\n\nThere are stupid statements. And then there are statements so outrageous, so ridiculous and so dangerous that they standout with startling clarity. This week, just such a rare instance occurred. In the middle of a concerning measles outbreak in Washington state, and with cases being reported in many other regions, Darla Shine, the wife of former Fox News bigwig and current deputy chief of staff for communications in the Trump administration Bill Shine said that childhood diseases such as measles \"keep you healthy & fight cancer.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets echoing the kinds of opinions she's held publicly for years, Shine lamented the fact her kids had received the MMR vaccine, which guards against measles, mumps and rubella. She added that people of her generation \u2014 Baby Boomers \u2014 were healthier now because they had measles as children. In other words, Shine implied that measles actually helps create a healthier population.\n\nBoomers do not have more immunity now because they had measles, or mumps or chicken pox as kids.\n\nShine is not a public official, but her comments are worth addressing because they reflect the same kinds of dangerous inaccuracies repeated by the anti-vaccination movement more broadly. Let\u2019s be clear, Boomers do not have more immunity now because they had measles, or mumps or chicken pox as kids. Medically, your immune system does not care if it is triggered by a vaccination or from picking up the measles from someone else. That is why vaccines work so well \u2014 the exposure produces the same immunity. (As an important aside, immunity does not always last a lifetime, whether built up after a bout of measles in kindergarten or, more sensibly, from a vaccination. Most Boomers should probably ask their doctor if they need a booster shot at this point.)\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nBut the core of Shine\u2019s argument is an apparent admiration for the effects of actual diseases. Before 1963, when I was still in my Boomer youth, there was no measles vaccine but there were three to four million cases of measles a year. The Centers for Disease Control estimates there were 48,000 measles hospitalizations each year in the decade before the vaccine became available, 1,000 cases of brain damage, many cases of deafness and a minimum of 450 deaths.\n\nBy the time Darla Shine was born in 1968 there was a vaccine; by 2000 that vaccine had eliminated measles in the U.S. Even as measles was being eradicated, however, something else very bizarre was happening: People with no medical training were spreading fake and repudiated science claiming that vaccines were bad for us. In the beginning, many of these \"anti-vaxxers\" claimed that vaccines caused autism. Now that this claim was been thoroughly debunked, the movement seems to be shifting tactics, arguing, for example, that vaccines overload babies' immune systems (not true) or make us somehow weaker (also incorrect).\n\nIt is nothing short of cruel to suggest that women who inherit breast cancer should have been more willing to catch chicken pox.\n\nThe idea that getting infectious diseases helps one acquire \u201cnatural\u201d immunity as opposed to the \u201cunnatural immunity\u201d provided by vaccines is a pernicious lie. Shine went so far as to suggest cancer can be battled by an immune system strengthened by measles. She should tell that to the thousands and thousands of people who have died from a myriad of cancers and who also had chicken pox or measles as children. As anyone even vaguely familiar with cancer knows, cancer couldn\u2019t care less about the measles, vitamins or other mythical notions of immunity. It is nothing short of cruel to suggest that women who inherit breast cancer should have been more willing to catch chicken pox.\n\nThis cruelty has consequences. As more parents have refused vaccines, measles, mumps and other diseases began to enjoy a comeback here and in other nations also caught up in anti-vaccination nonsense.\n\nSimply put, such ignorance puts all of our kids at risk. According to Clark County, Washington\u2019s Public Health Department, one of its 53 cases involved someone who had received the MMR vaccine. Forty-seven of those suffering from measles were unvaccinated and vaccination was unverified in five cases. (Shine had claimed \u201cmany\u201d of the kids infected in Washington had been vaccinated.)\n\nAs infectious diseases threaten to reappear, we need more vaccination not less. We could eliminate measles, greatly reduce cervical cancer and save tens of thousands of deaths caused by the flu if all Americans stopped believing what they read on Twitter and Facebook and instead listened to pediatricians, infectious disease experts, public health professionals and immunologists who know the facts about the safety and value of vaccines. Because for all her idiocy, Darla Shine ultimately is simply the symptom of a much bigger problem when it comes to fighting disease."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/amazon-pulling-out-new-york-victory-new-yorkers-now-congress-ncna971806", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 15, 2019, 8:41 PM GMT By Zephyr Teachout, author and law professor\n\nThe decision by Amazon to stop pursuing $3 billion in financial incentives from New York to locate its \"HQ2\" in the state was one of most startling corporate about-faces in recent memory, and biggest shows of grassroots power over a massive corporation, a plethora of industry lobbyists and government officials.\n\nWhy did it come to this? In short, people are mad as hell and they aren't going to take it any more.\n\nAs a society, we are at an inflection point when it comes to both corporate welfare and monopoly power. Decades of the race to the bottom and corporate subsidies failing to deliver well-paying jobs \u2014 just look at the failed FoxxConn deal in Wisconsin or the constant shuffle of low-wage temp jobs in Ellwood, Ill. \u2014 have made the typical promises of a corporate welfare deal feel less real. The sheer scope of the Amazon incentive package felt abusive and obscene, especially when the state is facing a $2.3 billion budget shortfall.\n\nMom and pop shops paying taxes while Amazon got billions just to come to town didn't seem right, and, post-FoxxConn, people are less likely to fall for the promised jobs numbers. Corporate welfare is finally getting the black eye it always deserved.\n\nMeanwhile, the outsized subsidies offered without New Yorkers' knowledge or input put Amazon into a situation in which they were suddenly getting daily scrutiny not just into the deal, but into all their business practices. People who never heard that Amazon pursued a contract with ICE for facial recognition software were suddenly hearing about it at work. Workers who use Amazon Prime, but hadn\u2019t realized how anti-union Amazon is suddenly didn\u2019t like what they were hearing. And millions of people who never heard the word monopolies before were suddenly hearing about how Amazon abuses and squeezes its sellers, because the sellers feel have few other options than to use Amazon's service, or that it takes their customers' ideas to compete against them. This once much-loved company (last year, it was one of the most loved companies by Democrats) was suddenly being revealed for what it was.\n\nAmazon\u2019s outsized power is looking less and less like smart business and more and more like oppressive politics \u2014 one company bullying us all. And the spotlight the deal brought to the company wasn't good for it overall.\n\nOf course, some of the reason that Amazon pulled out of the deal with New York was purely tactical: They were probably about to lose it anyway. State Senator Mike Gianaris was appointed to the state's Public Authorities Control Board this month, where he would have veto power over substantial parts of the Amazon subsidy package. Gianaris, who representing the Queens district in which Amazon planned to locate, was an outspoken critic of the deal based on its potential impact on rents and transportation, as well as Amazon\u2019s anti-union, ICE-enabling history.\n\nGianaris wasn\u2019t accidentally placed on the board by the new state Senate majority leader, and the subsidies weren\u2019t coincidentally under scrutiny: He was placed there because of enormous grassroots opposition to the deal that sprang up almost as immediately as the elected officials behind it made its terms public. Left wing Democrats and Democratic socialists began grassroots organizing in Queens against the deal; stories of Amazon warehouse workers peeing in bottles because of workplace demands weren\u2019t just shared in press releases, but at grassroots meetings. Most of the state's labor unions were initially opposed to the project, because Amazon wouldn\u2019t commit to union neutrality in New York (though they were hashing out a deal on that immediately prior to Amazon's pulling out).\n\nSo, when Cory Johnson, the New York City Council speaker, grilled Amazon at a hearing in December, he was cheered by hundreds of activists in the balcony carrying \u201cAmazon Lies\u201d banners.\n\nAmazon's capitulation to those opposed to their expansion in New York City is an epic moment for people power over an enormous corporate bully. But, when you beat a bully, you have to be sure not to let him get away with it somewhere else; this, then, is just the beginning of pushing back on the unfettered growth of corporate power. That same grassroots that demanded an end to a sweetheart deal for a one of the largest companies in the world will be part of the demand for a congressional hearing into Amazon's near-monopolistic powers.\n\nAmazon overstepped in New York, and we're not going to let the scrutiny into its actions fade just because it steps back."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-emergency-declaration-build-wall-will-cost-americans-more-ncna972146", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 15, 2019, 6:33 PM GMT By Robert Schlesinger\n\nThere is a national emergency, but it\u2019s not coming from caravans massing in Mexico. It\u2019s from an authoritarian flailing in Washington. The crisis that the country is now confronting has less to do with a porous physical boundary than with how the limits of presidential power are eroding before our eyes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ended weeks of flirting with the use of emergency powers to build his border wall and is taking the plunge. But one can only ruminate on an \u201cemergency\u201d for months before a solution is proffered that will take a decade to implement when the emergency is flimflam \u2013 a tissue of an excuse to assume ordinarily unavailable powers.\n\nThe situation on the border is hardly an emergency. Unauthorized border crossings are lower than they\u2019ve been in almost a half-century: Barely 300,000 people were detained trying to cross in fiscal year 2017, when the border was more secure than ever, as compared with 1.6 million in FY2000. The percentage of undocumented immigrants in border states is falling. And the counties abutting the Mexican border are among the nation\u2019s safest. There are humanitarian challenges at the border, but Trump and his inhumane policies are largely their cause rather than solution.\n\nTellingly Trump seems to have culled his most colorful warnings of border-related dangers from the silver screen and even admitted that his proclamation is a farce: \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this, but I\u2019d rather do it much faster,\u201d he said in his bizarre Friday press conference. But if something isn\u2019t even necessary, it\u2019s definitely not an emergency.\n\nThe crisis to which Trump is actually responding relates to his own impotence: The self-styled master negotiator couldn\u2019t persuade even quiescent Republicans to fund a wall during their congressional supremacy and then he couldn\u2019t leverage his government shutdown to force one from a Democratic majority.\n\nSo he\u2019s decided to cut Congress out of the policy-making process.\n\nDoing so will unleash legal and political firestorms. Congress will vote on a resolution to end the \u201cemergency,\u201d forcing Trump to veto it if passed. And it will trigger lawsuits not only from legislators upset that he\u2019s seizing their constitutional prerogatives, but from border-area landowners unwilling to sacrifice their property on the altar of King Donald\u2019s whims now freed, as a result of the president\u2019 emergency order, from the restrictions of the Depression-era Declaration of Takings Act which would otherwise limit their ability to sue to stop the project.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had warned against such a declaration before essentially agreeing to it; Republicans are already worried about the precedent a non-emergency emergency declaration sets. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the way we should be doing these sorts of things,\u201d said Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who had previously mused that a future Democratic president might use such a declaration about climate change to seize fossil-fuel power plants. (Indeed, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday noted that the next Democratic president might declare gun violence a national emergency.)\n\nBut forget a future Democrat\u2019s intentions: If Trump, long on despotic instincts and short on patience, gets away with this declaration, why wouldn\u2019t he do it again? It\u2019s staggering to imagine what other dead-end fancies might he resurrect as emergencies.\n\nOn the precedent question, though, it will be instructive to see how quickly the 2020 Democratic hopefuls\u2019 condemnations of Trump\u2019s overreach will be replaced with vows to exercise emergency powers to deal with issues such as climate change, gun violence or health care in the absence of Congressional action. But even if that doesn\u2019t happen this election cycle, if Trump\u2019s power-grab isn\u2019t slapped down \u2014 hard \u2014 it\u2019s inevitable that unfettered emergency declaration powers will become stump speech and debate staples before becoming staples of presidential legislating.\n\nAccomplishing something in the face of partisan sclerosis does have a certain appeal in 2019. But, as Julius Caesar is credited with saying, \u201cAll bad precedents begin as justifiable measures.\u201d (Caesar, remember, had first-hand experience with a necrotic republic.)\n\nOur system was designed around checks, balances and the need for compromise. Power was divided among three co-equal branches of government, each able to check the power of the others. Congress makes laws \u2014 including ones dictating how the federal government raises and spends money \u2014 and the president executes them faithfully. This is basic high school civics stuff, which might explain why it seems mysterious to Trump.\n\nHis national emergency scheme threatens to upend that balance. If emergency declarations become a way for an executive to legislate, then a president unable or unwilling to reach a deal with Congress need not make the effort to engage with the constitutional requirements set forth by our Founding Fathers.\n\nAnd to the extent that members of Congress go along with this \u2014 and several seem poised to join Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in the quisling caucus \u2014 they are deliberately downgrading their branch from coequal to subordinate, and slouching toward irrelevant.\n\nThis is just the latest and arguably most dangerous instance of a trend that predates Trump but which, like everything else he touches, he\u2019s made worse. Over recent decades the unwritten rules of politics, norms which distinguished powers that could be exercised from ones that should be, have increasingly been disregarded.\n\nSo the filibuster, once rarely used, is now the Senate standard. Acts of political terrorism \u2013 threatening deliberate harm to Americans through a government shutdown or national debt default unless otherwise unachievable demands are met \u2013 have become commonplace. Prosecutorial discretion was a matter of efficiency before President Barack Obama made it a policy tool. The Senate accepted a president\u2019s power to fill Supreme Court vacancies during his term until, without precedent, it didn\u2019t. McConnell\u2019s threat to politicize the response to 2016 Russian hacking scuttled the idea of politics stopping at the shoreline. And national emergencies were heretofore used to enact noncontroversial responses to real crises rather than as a tool of expediency for politically untenable ends.\n\nIn each case, politicians maximized partisan gains with little regard for long-term consequences. It\u2019s a political tragedy of the commons, where the desire to score points subsumes the greater good of having a functional and responsive political system. All of those examples illustrate a broader, darker picture of a political culture finding short-cuts away from the sometimes-arduous process of consensus, compromise and cooperation and instead opting for the quicker and easier \u2014 but constitutionally destructive \u2014 path of authoritarianism facilitated by obstruction.\n\nWhen running for office, Donald Trump promised repeatedly that Mexico was going to pay for his wall. Instead, it turns out, that we all may pay for it \u2013 both with our taxes and with our polity."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/netflix-s-umbrella-academy-weird-welcome-break-marvel-dc-comics-ncna972066", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 15, 2019, 4:31 PM GMT By Ani Bundel\n\n\u201cThe Punisher\u201d may not be officially dead yet, but the cancelation of \u201cDaredevil\u201d strongly suggests that Marvel\u2019s Netflix project is coming to an end. But that doesn\u2019t mean the streaming service is getting out of the superhero business, as proven by its new comic book adaptation, \u201cThe Umbrella Academy.\u201d The series, from independent comic book publisher Dark Horse, does not follow in Marvel\u2019s brooding footsteps, however, forging a goofier, weirder path. This is a superhero show that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously.\n\nThe original \u201cUmbrella Academy\u201d graphic novels were written by Gerard Way with illustrator Gabriel B\u00e1. If the former name sounds vaguely familiar, it\u2019s probably because Way was the lead singer of the popular band My Chemical Romance. While the show cuts the rock and roll backstories of some of its characters, the musical component of the original comics remains. This does make the series less gloriously insane than its source material, but for once, that's probably a good thing. Way, after all, began his career writing stories that could be told in four minutes or less. Instead, the show takes the best of Way\u2019s ideas from two of the original comics (\u201cThe Umbrella Academy: Apocalypse Suite\u201d and \u201cThe Umbrella Academy: Dallas\u201d) and elongates them.\n\nThe joy of the \u201cThe Umbrella Academy\u201d is that it takes traditional superhero tropes and reimagines them through a nihilistic, misanthropic lens.\n\nThe joy of the \u201cThe Umbrella Academy\u201d is that it takes traditional superhero tropes and reimagines them through a nihilistic, misanthropic lens. In short, it looks at the narrative popularized by \u201cThe X-Men\u201d \u2014 of mutant children raised in a special school \u2014 and then tries to figure out how badly that might harm the psyches of \u201cgifted\u201d children not necessarily thrilled about being drafted to save the world.\n\nIn Way\u2019s world, the academy\u2019s mutant children are part of a larger set: 43 children born miraculously at the same time across the world, to women who became pregnant and gave birth essentially instantaneously. But only seven of these miracle babies concern us, the ones bought up by eccentric billionaire and Umbrella Academy founder Sir Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore). Of those seven, only five have survived to adulthood, the ones known as Numbers 1-4 and Number 7. Hargreeves never bothered to learn their names, referring to them by numbers assigned in the order of how useful he found their mutant talents.\n\nNumber 1, also known as Luther, (Tom Hopper), for instance, has super strength. Number 7, known as Vanya (played by Ellen Page), is the odd child out, having never manifested any abilities. The missing family members are Number 5, whose ability to time travel accidentally backfired at the age of 13 and Number 6, who is dead \u2014 though no one will say how it happened.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled, though. \u201cThe Umbrella Academy\u201d initially sounds like a bleak \u201cX-Men\u201d knock-off, especially the part about digging into the childhood traumas of this not-so-merry-band-of-mutants. But those looking for a series that solemnly tackles themes like addiction or religious beliefs through the framework of a superhero lens will have to wait. \u201cUmbrella Academy\u201d is determined to have as much fun as Netflix will allow. Even Cameron Britton and Mary J. Blige, time-traveling serial murderers attempting to preserve the future from those who would alter it, join in the amusement.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nThe result is an oddly entertaining dichotomy. The show\u2019s attitude is most reminiscent of Alan Moore\u2019s \u201cWatchmen,\u201d with its dark outlook on humanity. But \u201cUmbrella Academy\u201d doesn\u2019t want to get serious in the same way Moore did. \u201cWatchmen\u2019s\u201d misanthropic superheroes were an allegory of the 1980s \u201cgreed is good\u201d era and the rise of global fascism during President Ronald Reagan's presidency. Likewise, \u201cThe X-Men\u201d takes the mutant children under the care of Professor X and turns their stories into parables about the dangers of bigotry. \u201cThe Umbrella Academy\u201d takes its cast of characters and asks, \u201cWhat if we had them dance to Tiffany?\u201d (This is not to knock Tiffany. In fact, one of the show\u2019s best moments of camerawork comes at the end of the musical sequence, which depicts each character privately dancing in their own room of the school as if it were a gigantic doll house.)\n\nSpeaking of musical sequences, it should probably not surprise anyone that a show based on a comic book written by a former rock star is musically oriented. Way is one of the show\u2019s co-executive producers, and the show\u2019s soundtrack is a major reason to recommend it. Even when the show drags \u2014 the ten episodes suffer from a mild case of Netflix bloat \u2014 there seems to always be a song to pep the proceedings up again, with bands ranging from the sprightly alternative They Might Be Giants to downtempo triphop mainstays like Morcheeba.\n\n\u201cThe Umbrella Academy\u201d is a welcome reminder that not all superhero stories have to wallow in their own nihilism. They can have fun with it! It also serves to remind audiences that interesting fables exist outside the Marvel and DC Comics canon. The Dark Horse catalogue, for example, has plenty of other gems if Netflix is willing to go spelunking. It\u2019s high time we had more narratives that aren\u2019t afraid of being silly in public, and that realize a little strangeness won't bring down the entire genre."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/alita-battle-angel-james-cameron-s-new-epic-visually-ambitious-ncna971816", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 14, 2019, 10:20 PM GMT By Ani Bundel\n\nFinally freed from scourge of \u201cFifty Shades\u201d Valentine\u2019s Day releases, this year\u2019s romantic offerings are more sardonic (\u201cWhat Men Want\u201d and \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic\u201d). But the highest-profile release this week isn\u2019t a rom-com. \u201cAlita: Battle Angel,\u201d produced and co-written by James Cameron, is a genre-hopping whirlwind of an epic, encompassing a coming-of-age story, an apocalyptic future and a very dangerous sport. Like other recent Cameron epics, \u201cAlita\u201d is a lot. It\u2019s ridiculously ambitious. It\u2019s gorgeous to look at, a technical marvel of a film that mixes digital and human characters into a single frame. It\u2019s just too bad the main plot isn\u2019t worthy of all the innovation.\n\nLike other recent Cameron epics, \u201cAlita\u201d is a lot. It\u2019s gorgeous to look at, a technical marvel of a film that mixes digital and human characters into a single frame.\n\nThe story of \u201cAlita\u201d is taken from a Japanese cyberpunk manga series known as \u201cGunnm,\u201d published in 1990. (The literal translation of the title is \u201cGun Dream.\u201d) After the first two volumes were turned into anime features, the series was dubbed in English and retitled first \u201cBattle Angel\u201d and then \u201cBattle Angel Alita.\u201d In a recent interview with the Associated Press, Cameron claims to have been working to bring this story to the big screen since his \u201cTitanic\u201d days, when he was first introduced to the comic.\n\nThe world of \u201cAlita\u201d is expertly created, a fascinating, post-apocalyptic landscape in the 26th century. Iron City inhabitants work and scrabble to find a way to the floating gentrified world of Zalem that hovers above them. Mostly digital, both Iron City and Zalem feel wondrously real and inhabitable. Cameron\u2019s ability to make Alita, an animated creation, hold her own while \u201cacting\u201d alongside very alive A-list Hollywood talent like Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali is equally impressive.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the newfangled performance-capture technology isn\u2019t typically used for characters who are or who appear human. (Video games highlight how difficult it is to render human faces realistically.) It\u2019s one thing to create the fictional Na'vi this way in \u201cAvatar.\u201d There\u2019s nothing in the human world to compare them to. Even characters like Caesar in \u201cPlanet of The Apes\u201d don\u2019t have to be perfect, because many moviegoers have watched the progression of technology from film to film. But human faces are something moviegoers see every day, with their constant muscle movements expressing complex emotional and physical signals. This is why, even now, when cyborg and robot characters are shown on screen, there\u2019s usually a human actor behind the CGI.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nNot here. The star of \u201cAlita,\u201d Rosa Salazar, is completely obliterated, replaced wholesale with the digitalized Alita. And for nearly the entire movie, it\u2019s easy to forget Alita, giant eyes and all, isn\u2019t an actual person standing beside Waltz or her one true love Hugo (Keean Johnson.) Though the eyes have drawn complaints from several quarters, including reviewers and Twitter fans, they\u2019re actually an extremely clever choice that redirect focus away from the rest of the face and compensate for other features that may fail to render human expressions as perfectly.\n\nCameron\u2019s name and clout in Hollywood were instrumental in getting the film made, but this is not his film alone. It was written in partnership with Laeta Kalogridis, who was the brains behind Netflix\u2019s ultra-violent \u201cAltered Carbon\u201d last year and directed by Robert Rodriguez, who has helmed hits from \u201cSin City\u201d to \u201cSpy Kids.\u201d\n\nSadly, having a female voice in the scripting process did not prevent a seeming cluelessness about how a female protagonist might react in various situations. As realistic as Alita may seem while fighting with Mahershala Ali\u2019s bad guy Vector, she\u2019s a disappointing heroine. Her continued infatuation with Hugo is both unbelievable and vaguely irritating. Her \u201crebellion\u201d against her father lacks emotional depth, feeling more like something a guy might encourage his teenage girlfriend to do in order to get into her pants. When Alita changes cyborg bodies after her first one is broken, the way the camera leers over her sudden boobs and hips is plain old icky.\n\n\u201cAlita\u201d mostly fails when it attempts to talk about puberty and romance from a girl\u2019s point of view. The film is most coherent, on the other hand, as an action adventure story starring Alita as the hero tasked with bringing down Zalem\u2019s evil overlord. The Motorball scenes are also impressive, if sometimes jarring. Rodriguez does his best work directing the competitions, which also include some of the most suspenseful fight sequences of the entire film. Unfortunately, none of these elements are granted a satisfying conclusion, with the film\u2019s ending clearly prepping for a sequel.\n\nWhen it comes to the technical parts of \u201cAlita,\u201d fans of Cameron are going to get their money\u2019s worth. This is the rare movie that\u2019s actually worth seeing in 3D. In part for this reason, it may also break a few box office records while it\u2019s out. I just wish the production had focused more on storytelling. Cameron has pushed the boundaries of what digitally created female heroes can look like \u2014 if only he\u2019d put the same amount of thought into pushing the limits of who they can be."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-criticizes-ilhan-omar-anti-semitism-her-critique-pro-israel-ncna971681", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 14, 2019, 6:33 PM GMT By Noah Berlatsky\n\nDo large contributions from pro-Israeli groups determine U.S. policy in Israel?\n\nThat's not a new question, but it's surged back into the news this week following a series of tweets from Minnesota Congressional representative Ilhan Omar. Omar tweeted that her colleagues\u2019 refusal to criticize Israel was \"All about the Benjamins baby.\" She specifically called out AIPAC \u2014 the largest American pro-Israel lobbying group \u2014 for paying lawmakers to support Israeli policies.\n\nThe backlash to the comments was swift and intense; both Republicans and Democrats condemned them, and Omar apologized. President Donald Trump has called on her to resign \u2014 characteristically ignoring his own much worse history of anti-Semitic remarks.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nBut as often happens with these kinds of scuffles, all the recriminations and partisan jockeying has somewhat distracted from more substantive issues. Omar's tweets, inadvertently, referenced painful anti-Semitic tropes by framing Jewish money as a corrupting influence in politics. But she also raised real, legitimate concerns about the role of pro-Israeli lobbying influence on Congress.\n\nSuch lobbying is less nefarious, and more complicated, than Omar's tweets indicate. Understanding how it works in more detail is important if the U.S. is ever to engage more thoughtfully \u2014 and yes, critically \u2014 with Israel's current far-right, racist government, which has expanded settlements on Palestinian lands and has abandoned a commitment to Palestinian statehood.\n\nBut as often happens with these kinds of scuffles, all the recriminations and partisan jockeying has somewhat distracted from more substantive issues.\n\nMany on the left believe that lobbying is in fact largely a bribery scheme. Thus, David Klion, a Jewish journalist, tweeted, \"If the Palestinians could outbid AIPAC, then [Republican House Minority leader Kevin] McCarthy would be a BDS supporter, as would his entire caucus. This isn't complicated.\"\n\nThis line of reasoning suggests representatives in Congress simply sell their votes to the highest bidder. They don't support BDS (a pro-Palestinian boycott movement) because no one pays them to do so.\n\nPolitical scientists, though, have been a lot more skeptical about the direct influence of money on politics. A 2003 survey of literature in the Journal of Economic Perspectives found that \"Legislators' votes depend almost entirely on their own beliefs and the preferences of their voters and their party. Contributions explain a minuscule fraction of the variation in voting behavior in the U.S. Congress.\"\n\nThe paper was titled \u201cWhy is There so Little Money in U.S. Politics?\u201d It pointed out that given the billions and billions of dollars at stake in public policy decisions, campaign contributions by interest groups are tiny. For instance, agribusiness gave $93 million in contributions in 2018. But ethanol subsidies alone are worth tens of billions of dollars. If money translates directly into policy, agribusiness should be paying a lot more to influence elections. It would be worth it.\n\nDespite their reputation and conventional wisdom, campaign contributions don't generally translate directly into policy changes.\n\nBut despite their reputation and conventional wisdom, campaign contributions don't generally translate directly into policy changes, according to Clare Brock, a professor of government at Texas Woman's University who studies lobbying. \"Most political scientists do not think about lobbying as vote buying, though sometimes the general public does think of it this way,\" she told me. \"In fact, most of the time lobbying does not seem to actually change votes.\"\n\nPaul Waldman at the American Prospect, for example, compared NRA spending and election results from 2004 through 2010. What he found was that \"The NRA has virtually no impact on congressional elections.\" This is in part, he said, because the vast majority of NRA endorsements go to Republicans in deeply red regions. NRA contributions are also spread widely and are generally small per congressperson\u201a only around $2,500. In short, the NRA makes small contributions to safe Republican seats \u2014 not a tactic designed to significantly change anyone's vote. The organization uses its resources as if it knows what political scientists know \u2014 which is that lobbying contributions don't really buy votes.\n\nThat doesn't mean that lobbying is worthless. Lobbying can get a member of Congress to become more vocal on an issue. Or lobbying can inform a member about what votes they can best take to advance a cause they already support. \"Lobbying appears, most of the time, to act more like insurance, working at the margins, rather than setting the agenda,\" Clare Brock says.\n\nAnd indeed, there are anecdotal accounts of instances in which money from pro-Israeli lobbying groups directly changed a vote. AIPAC in particular has a fearsome reputation for effectiveness; this reputation, as with the NRA, may be more valuable to it than money. But even so, Brock says, lobbying is in general a way to prevent a change in the status quo, rather than to push members of Congress to endorse radical new policies.\n\nAIPAC, in particular, uses methods other than direct handouts, according to political scientist Eleanor Powell of University of Wisconsin, Madison. In fact, AIPAC, as a lobbying group, can't contribute directly to candidates.\n\nInstead Powell says, the organization has invested in \"a lot of congressional trips to Israel, to try to woo members.\" Those trips give the lobbyists access to make their case. Trips also make lawmakers feel directly connected to Israel, which may sway their votes in some instances.\n\nBut the main reason that AIPAC and other Israeli lobbyists are so successful, Powell says, is because of \"electoral influence.\" AIPAC is influential because a lot of voters want to support Israel. Three-quarters of the public has a positive view of Israel, according to Gallup.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, strong, engaged voting blocks on the left and right support the current pro-Israel stance. \"Evangelical Christians are on the right pushing pro-Israel policies,\" says Powell, \"and then you have Jewish voters, who tend to break Democratic. Historically that's been the larger picture driving pro Israel policy, rather than any contributions.\"\n\nAmerica\u2019s current willingness to support Israel no matter what it does to the Palestinians is based on the normal political processes of U.S. government.\n\nAmerica\u2019s current willingness to support Israel no matter what it does to the Palestinians is based on the normal political processes of U.S. government. These processes often result in horrific outcomes, like mass incarceration or shooting tear gas at children. But they aren't the result of bribery.\n\nWhy is this important? First, when you argue that Jewish or pro-Israel money has undermined the political system, you're playing into anti-Semitic tropes that portray Jews as wealthy conspirators who corrupt a healthy body politic. This harms Jewish people everywhere \u2014 and the backlash to it can delegitimize necessary criticism of U.S.-Israel foreign policy.\n\nSecond, if you want to change U.S. foreign policy, it's important to understand what actually motivates it. If we think money in politics is the problem, that means activists should push for campaign finance reform or reduce the influence of lobbyists. Campaign finance reform might help a bit around the edges with a lot of issues, including foreign policy. But money is not the main driver of U.S. support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and so focusing on lobbying alone is unlikely to solve the problem.\n\nTo change U.S.-Israel policy, we will need to change public opinion. Accomplishing that change will be hard, but there are some positive signs. Netanyahu's close association with Trump and the U.S. far right has alienated many American Jews. Younger Jews are, in any case, less supportive of Zionism.\n\nThose are flickers of hope for the long term. The short-term prospects for change are not especially optimistic. But the short-term prospects for decarceration, or a less hateful immigration policy aren't all that bright either. In some ways, the fight would be easier if it were just about raising more money than the opposition. At least the goal would be clearer then. For better or worse, though, politics is not simply \"about the Benjamins.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/progressive-democrats-have-solution-america-s-distrust-politicians-stop-accepting-ncna925806", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nOct. 30, 2018, 9:21 AM GMT By Navin Nayak, executive director, Center for American Progress Action Fund\n\nDistrust of our political system has reached historic levels such that voters of all stripes now instinctively assume that politicians are corrupted by the political contributions they receive. A 2018 Pew Research Center report suggests that 73 percent of Americans believe that donating money to politicians provides donors with disproportionate influence on elected officials.\n\nSo it's not surprising that the same report found that 77 percent of respondents believe that the amount of money that individuals and organizations can contribute to candidates should be limited. (Donors themselves are more likely to believe that their elected officials will help them with their problems.) A 2017 Ipsos poll for the Center for Public Integrity similarly found that fully 57 percent of respondents supported limits on the amount of money that Super PACs could raise and spend.\n\nThe public\u2019s distrust is easily justified when you hear something like what Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s budget director and the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said about how his office worked when he was a member of Congress: \u201cIf you\u2019re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn\u2019t talk to you.\u201d\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, the Democrats must be the party that works to rebuild the public\u2019s trust in government and political leaders by showing the public that the government can help solve many of the mounting economic challenges families are facing. But for voters to have trust in those government policies, they must first believe that the politicians creating them are serving the public's, and not lobbyists', interest.\n\nThat\u2019s why rejecting corporate PAC money is such an important step for Democrats to take. It shows voters that you understand that political corruption is a real concern for them and it demonstrates whose side you\u2019ll be on. Perhaps most importantly, it affirms that your policy decisions won\u2019t be influenced by corporate contributions.\n\nYet, consider the status quo: Of the nearly 200 Democrats currently serving in the House of Representatives only seven current Democratic House members have rejected corporate PAC money (including Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Penn., who made the issue central to his race last spring).\n\nBy comparison, there are more than 100 Democratic challengers running in November who have made this same commitment. Just as importantly, they are making this central to their pitch to voters \u2014 putting it front and center in their campaign ads.\n\nHaving all Democrats reject corporate PAC money (and even money from registered lobbyists) would help to transform how the public views the party, and it would draw a powerful contrast with Republicans who are perceived as being beholden to corporate special interests. A recent poll showed that 47 percent of voters said that they would be much more likely to say a Democratic candidate is \u201cfor the people\u201d if they rejected corporate PAC money. Another 31 percent said that they would be \u201csomewhat more likely\u201d to believe that, underscoring the potential reach of such an action.\n\nThat so many Democratic challengers have embraced this position is an integral factor to their success: It has been a unifying thread between surprising Democratic victories by candidates as distinct as Lamb, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ayanna Pressley, in districts that could not be more different from each other. And it underscores the broad appeal \u2014 across regions and partisanship \u2014 of such an act. No matter where you live, you want an elected official who will represent you, and not just the wealthy and the well-connected.\n\nOf course, Democratic politicians should be willing and eager to meet with any company or industry that is looking to create good-paying jobs, particularly in their state or district. But how do they explain to their constituents why those corporations had to give money before or after a meeting? With our political system awash in money from corporations and big donors, voters can understandably only see perverse intent behind those contributions.\n\nIf Democrats are successful in the November midterms, those who have rejected corporate PAC money should only be the beginning of this trend. The entire Democratic caucus should follow the lead of these challengers who are taking the first step in restoring trust in politicians, and get serious about reforming the whole system by strengthening ethics laws, expanding voting rights and legally limiting the influence of money in our politics.\n\nDemocrats in the House have already introduced a bold agenda to do just that and, if the American people give them the chance, they should and must fend off those who want to water it down and follow through. The journey to restore trust in our system starts by walking the walk, not imitating Republicans and merely talking the talk."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/romantic-comedies-aren-t-so-sweet-if-they-only-show-ncna971546", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 14, 2019, 5:51 PM GMT By Jenni Miller\n\nAs a female film critic, I\u2019ve often been assigned to review romantic comedies.

It\u2019s much harder to imagine that something is within your grasp if everything you see tells you that it isn\u2019t, and it never will be.\n\nThere needs to be room for everyone to see themselves happy, loved and desired, because it is possible and you do deserve it, and it\u2019s much easier to give up if everyone around you is telling you to.\n\nRomance shouldn\u2019t just be the purview of just straight people, or white people, or skinny people, and the indelible popularity of movies like \u201cHairspray,\u201d \u201cJust Wright\u201d and \u201cThe Perfect Holiday\u201d prove that lots of us who fall outside of the \u201cnorm\u201d are desperate to see ourselves in cute clothes and sexy situations. \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d raked in the bucks not just because they\u2019re awesome movies, but because their target audiences are radically underserved.\n\nSimilarly, the sweet teen comedy \u201cLove, Simon\u201d raked in the bucks, and Clea DuVall\u2019s upcoming rom-com \u201cHappiest Holiday\u201d (which will star Kristen Stewart as one half of a lesbian couple heading to a family holiday party wherein awkward hijinks will ensue) has got crushed-out fans quivering with anticipation.\n\nSo perhaps some major studios are seeing the light about non-hetero romantic movies aimed at women and helmed by men. Warner Bros., for instance, is releasing \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic\u201d right before Valentine\u2019s Day with a huge advertising push. I haven\u2019t seen it, but so far it seems quite promising: With plus-sized Rebel Wilson in the lead, it seemingly portrays her not as a joke or a goofy, horned-up weirdo but as a smart, sexy chick being wooed by Liam Hemsworth. That might seem like nothing, but it\u2019s not. (It\u2019s also clutch that Wilson apologized for her statement on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d that she is \u201cthe first ever plus-sized girl to be the star of a romantic comedy,\u201d even though Queen Latifah, Mo\u2019Nique, Ricki Lake and a few other choice ladies paved the way.)\n\nAnd then there\u2019s \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d which is touching a tender nerve with audiences for reasons other than Catherine O\u2019Hara\u2019s mesmerizing outfit changes. Dan Levy, who co-created the series with his father Eugene, co-stars as David Rose, who evolves from a spoiled brat (draped in asymmetrical Rick Owens-esque outfits) to half of one of the most charming couples in media today, alongside Noah Reid as Patrick.\n\nThere is something so effortless about the portrayal of their courtship \u2014 not the courtship itself, of course, because that\u2019s not how life or sitcoms work \u2014 and what\u2019s more, David\u2019s laidback description of his pansexuality (\"I like the wine and not the label\") is so logical that anyone can get it.\n\nThe comfort and trust that builds between David and Patrick is one of the sweetest and truest portrayals of love I\u2019ve seen in mainstream media in quite a while. It\u2019s not pedantic; it\u2019s not a big deal. It just is.\n\nIdeally, pop culture can engender sympathy for those we consider \u201cother.\u201d In my less-generous moments, it seems like a fun idea to make some mean-spirited folks watch John Waters\u2019 \u201cHairspray\u201d for 12 hours straight, \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d-style. But maybe, just maybe, the mainstreaming of rom-coms for and about everyone would pry their minds open just a little \u2014 perhaps enough to let in some sunshine and, dare I say, empathy, if not love."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/video/is-love-a-choice-or-a-feeling-five-couples-share-their-stories-1442555971842", "text": "Is love a choice or a feeling?

But it is a reassuring sign that as U.S. law enforcement continues to expand its reach around the world in the name of the war on terror, the courts \u2014 and the American people \u2014 have not been cut out of the justice process. Thus Guzm\u00e1n's conviction is, at the very least, an important symbol of democratic accountability.\n\nIn this respect, it was also a win for the American system of jurisprudence at a time when the courts are under fire.\n\nAnd in this respect, it was also a win for the American system of jurisprudence at a time when the courts are under fire, and when immigration issues and the drug war are increasingly being intentionally blurred together. According to the New York Times, Judge Brian Cogan, was \u201cclearly emotional\u201d when he told the jurors that in his entire career, he had never seen any jury so closely examine all the evidence. \u201cQuite frankly, it made me proud to be an American,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the U.S. law enforcement agency which officially has the broadest reach. It operates in 69 countries around the world and, thanks to various Patriot Act statutes, it now operates on the front lines of the war on terror, as former DEA officials like to tell me. \u201cThere is no more virulent form of terrorism than drug trafficking,\u201d says former DEA chief of international operations Mike Vigil.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nIn U.S.-led overseas contingency operations, whether focused on terrorism, drug trafficking or a mix of both, the courts in foreign countries can and should play a key role. But in Afghanistan and Mexico, for example \u2014 both countries that receive aid from the U.S. to help strengthen the rule of law \u2014 the judicial system and law enforcement are not necessarily strong enough to handle the Guzm\u00e1ns of this world.\n\nThe hope, of course, is that in the years to come, a major criminal like Guzm\u00e1n could be tried in a court in Culiacan, Mexico, rather than in Brooklyn. But until then, the ability of the U.S. to arrest \u2014 or assist in the arrest \u2014 extradite and prosecute criminals is a crucial deterrent. The DEA is not without its critics, both at home and abroad, but Guzm\u00e1n's arrest is an example of the system working as it should to bring supercriminals to justice as fairly and transparently as possible.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the DEA has played a key role in forcing warlords to face justice in the U.S. court system. Haji Bagcho, who the U.S. accused of propping up the Taliban with heroin proceeds, was charged with narcoterrorism in 2012 and sentenced to life in prison. This narcoterrorism statute, created during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, has also been used to help weaken the FARC guerrilla group in Colombia and bring dozens of its leaders to trial in New York and Washington DC; it has also been used on several other big Taliban-connected warlords.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n was not accused of narcoterrorism, but testimony at both this trial and a previous Sinaloa cartel case in Chicago has linked his organization to such activity and weaponry, and there is no doubt that in the coming years, some of the more aggressive leaders of Mexican cartels will face narcoterrorism charges. Armed with controversial anti-drug laws like 2015\u2019s Transnational Drug Trafficking Act, which then-President Barack Obama signed a few months before leaving office, prosecutors and law enforcement have more and more tools at their disposal. (The Obama-era law effectively allows prosecutors to go after international drug traffickers if there is \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d the drugs are eventually destined for the U.S.)\n\nAs with Guzm\u00e1n, it will hopefully be jurors who decide these suspected criminals\u2019 fates. Juries help ensure honesty on the part of prosecutors, defense attorneys and law enforcement. Even with high-profile cases, corruption and corner-cutting happen. But a diligent jury can act as an important backstop.\n\nEven with high-profile cases, corruption and corner-cutting happen. But a diligent jury can act as an important backstop.\n\nJudge Cogan was not exaggerating: The jurors in the Guzm\u00e1n trial were subjected to 56 witnesses and shown just a part of what the prosecution called an \u201cavalanche of evidence\u201d \u2014 thousands of documents, audio and video files and transcripts of text messages and phone conversations \u2014 some of which they examined in close detail. During deliberations, jurors requested transcripts of testimony and specific exhibits, surprising some journalists covering the proceedings who (not surprisingly) couldn\u2019t remember those details.\n\nAlthough the defense did its best to trip up the government\u2019s expert witnesses, and sought to portray Guzm\u00e1n as a victim of an unjust system run by corrupt politicians and policemen, jurors appeared to see through such claims as baseless or irrelevant. Instead, the jury focused on the conspiracies that the government had to prove: namely, drug trafficking conspiracies and in the case of the complicated charge known as \"continuing criminal enterprise,\" one allegation of murder.\n\nIf future juries are as deliberate as those who decided the fate of Guzm\u00e1n, the fate of U.S. law enforcement operations, at home and abroad, appears to be in pretty good hands."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/smoking-marijuana-isn-t-inherently-safe-we-can-t-let-ncna970681", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 13, 2019, 7:15 PM GMT / Updated Feb. 13, 2019, 7:34 PM GMT By Alex Berenson, author of \"Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence\"\n\nThe tricks that tobacco companies used to hide the risks of cigarettes are no secret.\n\nInternal corporate documents disclosed during the litigation against cigarette companies show the way the industry worked to create uncertainty about tobacco\u2019s cancer risks long after mainstream scientists had reached a consensus. \u201cDoubt is our product,\u201d a tobacco executive famously wrote in 1969.\n\nA 2005 paper in Public Health Chronicles outlined a six-part strategy by the companies, including suppressing research that did not support their position and taking their case directly to the media. The companies knew that reporters might quote industry representatives in a false quest for balance that misled readers about the actual state of the science.\n\nMillions of Americans died from smoking-related illnesses before legal and political pressure forced the industry to admit the truth. Now, we run the risk of history repeating itself, with a different drug and a new generation of conflicts of interest \u2014 but, sadly, some of the same companies.\n\nMillions of Americans died from smoking-related illnesses before legal and political pressure forced the industry to admit the truth. Now, we run the risk of history repeating itself.\n\nIn the last two decades, scientists have found a link between cannabis use and severe mental illness. Even in controlled laboratory settings, some people dosed with THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis, will have hallucinations. Cannabis use in adolescence appears to change structures in the brain in ways that may contribute to mental illness. And many large studies \u2014 dating back to one that covered more than 50,000 people and was published in 1987 \u2014 show that people who use cannabis as teenagers have a much higher risk of developing schizophrenia, the most devastating mental illness.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nReviewing the science in 2016 in Biological Psychiatry, three British epidemiologists reported \u201cenough evidence to warrant a public health message that cannabis use can increase the risk of psychotic disorders.\u201d (The research that led to findings like those formed the core of my new book, \u201cTell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence.\u201d)\n\nThe next year, the National Academy of Medicine, a non-profit group that advises the government on health and medical issues, released a landmark 468-page report on the health effects of marijuana. After reviewing the evidence, a 16-member committee convened by the academy found that \u201ccannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater risk.\u201d\n\nBut investors and companies in the legalized cannabis industry, which already reaps billions of dollars annually, are doing everything possible to squelch that message. The industry \u2014 comprised of venture capital companies, specialized media outlets, consultants, delivery services and large growers \u2014 provides users with few warnings about the mental health risks of cannabis while making unproven claims about cannabis\u2019s effectiveness as medicine, even for people with psychiatric disorders.\n\nSome of the people spreading these messages and downplaying the risks are scientists, drug policy groups and even public health experts. And some of these have conflicts of interest reminiscent of those of tobacco-funded scientists.\n\nFor example, the Cannabis Research Initiative at UCLA promises \u201ctimely education, research, and service to lead public policy and public health decisions regarding cannabis.\u201d Yet the institute accepts donations from cannabis investors, like \u2014 better known as Snoop Dogg \u2014 who is not just a prominent user but the general partner of a $45 million venture capital fund focused on marijuana companies.\n\nSimon and Schuster\n\nThe best known pro-legalization group, the Drug Policy Alliance, also takes money from cannabis companies. It openly solicits money from corporate partners, asking them to \u201cgive back:\u201d \u201cDrug policy should create opportunities, not take them away. Support DPA\u2019s work to end marijuana prohibition\u2026[by] making a corporate donation to the Drug Policy Alliance. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n\nThose corporate partners will likely be happy to hear that the alliance refuses to support simple and straightforward warnings on the psychiatric risks of cannabis \u2014 warnings I, for one, have suggested \u2014 such as \u201cIf you have panic attacks or unusual thoughts, especially paranoid thoughts, while using cannabis, the drug may be increasing your risk for severe mental illness and you should not use it.\u201d\n\nThen there is Dr. Mark Kleiman.\n\nDr. Kleiman, a professor at New York University, is one of the most prominent cannabis public-policy researchers in the United States and an advocate of legalization. Politico called him \u201cthe policy wonk behind legal pot.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Kleiman is the chairman of a private research firm, BOTEC Analysis LLC, which promises, \u201cThe Right Answer to the Right Question.\u201d He has downplayed the connection between cannabis and psychosis, comparing it to the extraordinarily rare risk that vaccines may cause paralysis. (In fact, the evidence suggests that heavy adolescent cannabis users have a doubling or tripling of their baseline risk of developing schizophrenia, implying that at least 1 in 100 additional users may develop it. Flu vaccines cause paralysis roughly 1 in 1 million times they are dosed \u2014 a risk one-ten-thousandth as large.)\n\nIn response to recent questions about potential conflicts of interest related to BOTEC\u2019s work, Kleiman vehemently and unequivocally denied any conflicts. \"BOTEC has never had any business dealings with any firm involved in any way with the cannabis industry,\u201d he told me recently via email.\n\nYet on its own website, BOTEC discloses that its clients include the cigarette companies Altria and Philip Morris International. All by itself, that relationship would be troubling. Many academic researchers have committed to refuse any tobacco funding, arguing the companies are inherently untrustworthy because of the way they manipulated science. And cigarette companies have considered investing in marijuana for almost 50 years.\n\nNow they are no longer bystanders. In 2016, Philip Morris International put $20 million into Syqe Medical Ltd., an Israeli company whose primary product is a \"pocket-sized selective-dose cannabis inhaler.\" In 2018, Altria made a $1.8 billion investment in Cronos Group, a Canadian cannabis grower \u2014 a sum so large that it ends any fiction that tobacco and cannabis are separate industries.\n\nBOTEC\u2019s involvement with for-profit companies involved in cannabis does not end with cigarette makers, and the company is less forthcoming about other conflicts. For example, in 2016, NYU hosted a cannabis-related summit that was chaired by Kleiman and produced by BOTEC. For-profit companies in the cannabis industry sponsored the summit, which included a talk on \u201cInvesting in Cannabis.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to square BOTEC\u2019s work on the summit with Kleiman\u2019s denials of any conflicts. And given Kleiman\u2019s personal importance in the debate around cannabis and the convergence of the cannabis and tobacco industries, he should end any consulting for the cigarette industry.\n\nBut Kleiman is far from alone. As the debate about whether and how the United States should legalize at the federal level heats up, other key scientists, advocacy groups, and public-policy experts on cannabis must also make full disclosures of their conflicts, and not just about marijuana itself.\n\nRecently, another prominent drug policy researcher told me unequivocally that they had never taken money from tobacco, alcohol, gambling, or cannabis industries. That kind of clear, direct, and simple disclosure leaves no room for doubt \u2014 and eliminates questions about bias.\n\nBig Tobacco used friendly researchers, polluted science and resisted controls on its product for generations. Millions of Americans died as a result. Marijuana is another addictive smoked product, and even as its use rises, we are still trying to figure out exactly how dangerous it might be and how to discourage its use.\n\nLet's not make the same mistake twice.\n\nAlex Berenson's new book \"Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence\" was published on January 8, 2019."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/southern-baptist-convention-report-sex-abuse-shines-light-evangelical-culture-ncna970756", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 12, 2019, 10:39 PM GMT By Linda Kay Klein, author of \"Pure\"\n\nSexual abuse was never just a Catholic problem. But unlike the Catholic structure, evangelical churches like the one I grew up in and have spent the past 13 years researching are largely self-governing. This means we\u2019ve mostly lacked the kind of bureaucratic record that might prove systemic abuse the way it\u2019s been documented in Catholic dioceses.\n\nNow, a report on a major evangelical denomination is changing all that.\n\nA joint investigation by two Texas papers, the Houston Chronicle and the San Antonio Express-News, resulted in a three-part report revealing that over 200 Southern Baptist pastors, youth pastors and deacons were convicted or took plea deals for sex crimes over the past 20 years \u2014 leaving behind over 700 survivors. When the vast majority of rapes in the United States never lead to a felony conviction, these numbers suggest an astronomical level of violence.\n\nSexual violence extends well beyond the church, yet I have found that religious authoritarianism and purity culture can enable it.\n\nIn fact, it was a multi-church sexual misconduct cover-up that first challenged my own allegiance to evangelicalism. When I was in high school, my Midwestern non-denominational youth pastor was convicted of child enticement with intent to have sexual contact with a 12-year-old girl from our youth group. The ensuing investigation revealed that he had previously been quietly let go from two evangelical institutions for similar behavior.\n\nAs an adult, I went on to spend more than a decade researching sexuality and the evangelical church and heard story after story of minimized and unreported abuse. To be sure, sexual violence extends well beyond the church, yet I have found that religious authoritarianism and purity culture \u2014 hallmarks of both Catholicism and evangelicalism, among other groups \u2014 can enable it.\n\nPurity culture teaches that there are two types of people: those who are sexually \u201cpure,\u201d and those who are \u201cimpure.\u201d Some teach one can lose their purity by having sexual thoughts or feelings or making sexual choices outside of a heterosexual marriage. Some even teach you can lose it by inspiring sexual expression in others.\n\nToo often the prestige of a high-ranking perpetrator protects them, as we have seen happen in secular spaces as well, for example with former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, and film producer Harvey Weinstein. However, \u201cprestige\u201d doesn\u2019t quite do justice to the untouchability a religious leader can enjoy in a highly stratified community where it is believed that they have been hand-selected or at least approved by God. Many parishioners see their pastor as the conduit to a higher power and will go to great lengths to protect them even if it means ignoring, blaming and ultimately hurting survivors.\n\nIn America, a contributing factor is a strong culture of collective victimhood in the evangelical community. My interviewees and I were taught growing up that evangelicals were the real victims \u2014 that the world hated us so much they\u2019d do anything to make us look bad. So, it was our job to represent our community in the best light possible for more people to join us and enter into heaven. The underlying message was clear: a good Christian keeps their mouth shut.\n\nThose who speak out about sexual abuse in authoritarian religious communities are often shamed in an attempt to quiet them. They may be accused of seeking attention, or of trying to bring down a godly man. They may be told they\u2019re selfish \u2014 indulging in their own pain when they should be paying attention to the pain they are causing others, including the people who will turn away from the church and spend an eternity in hell because of the poor light they\u2019ve portrayed the church in.\n\nAfter all, abusers don\u2019t just groom victims, they groom communities, preparing them to rise up and protect them.\n\nWomen and girls, in particular, can be silenced in hierarchic churches that teach \u201ccomplementarianism\u201d \u2014 the belief that God ordains male authority especially in the church and the home. Having been conditioned not to question men, some women struggle to stand up to male misconduct when they see it, and when they do are often dismissed. For example, when my youth pastor was applying for the position, he was given a kind of audition: lead a youth retreat. Our head pastor asked us to report back on his performance. I did. As did at least one other girl. Each of us told the head pastor that the man applying for the position made us uncomfortable. Soon afterward, it was announced that he was our new youth pastor.\n\nMeanwhile, when women and girls come forward as survivors, purity culture \u2014 which focuses largely on them \u2014 can be used against them. Many of my interviewees and I were taught that men are weak when faced with the temptation of the female flesh and it was therefore our responsibility to protect men from the threat that our bodies posed to them. We had to walk, talk and dress just right to ensure the alleged purity of our entire community, safeguarding against all sexual expression outside of marriage \u2014 the implication being that anything that did happen, even sexual violence, was our fault.\n\nWhen women and girls come forward as survivors, purity culture \u2014 which focuses largely on them \u2014 can be used against them.\n\nSexual abuse of adults is too often lumped in with so-called sexual sin more generally speaking. For example, and as I talk about in my book, until somewhat recently the \u201cSexual Misconduct\u201d category of the Code of Student Conduct at the Catholic University of America included both rape and consensual sex outside of marriage.\n\nThe failure to differentiate between purported sin and violent crime can also be observed in how cases are sometimes handled by churches. The report on the Southern Baptist Convention, for example, found that some accused and convicted abusers were never reported to law enforcement by church leadership; some are still working at churches; some are even still in the pulpit.\n\nIt\u2019s only recently that evangelical leaders have even begun to be held accountable for sexual misconduct. Last year, Paige Patterson, president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, was forced into early retirement after reportedly mishandling rape allegations, and superstar megachurch pastor, Bill Hybels, retired early after a number of women accused him of sexually inappropriate behavior. But if we really want to deal with systemic sexual abuse in the church, we need to do more than remove a few bad apples. We need to take a long look at the theological and structural conditions that enable abuse \u2014 rejecting purity teachings that are used to shame and blame survivors, renouncing authoritarianism and elevating the voices of the many who remain unheard."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/can-we-tax-rich-jesse-eisinger-explains-ncna970581", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 12, 2019, 10:29 PM GMT By Why Is This Happening?\n\n**Listen for details on how to win tickets to our live WITHpod recording with Stacey Abrams!**\n\nWhy is it so hard to raise taxes on the rich? From freshmen firebrands to presidential hopefuls, taxing the wealthy has become the Congressional conversation du jour of 2019 with no signs of slowing down. But before even getting into the policy debates and the ideological disputes, there\u2019s one important and fundamental question that has to be answered: Do we have an IRS that has the capacity to do such a thing?\n\nProPublica\u2019s Jesse Eisinger has done stellar reporting to uncover the scandalous hidden story of the ways the Republican Party, corporate interests, and big donors have all succeeded in gutting the IRS of its ability to do the one thing it exists to do: collect taxes to fund the United States government.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Tax debts expire after 10 years. Roughly several hundred million used to expire in 2011 on average. In years past. Now it's eight billion in the most recent year.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wait a second. What you're telling me is that eight billion dollars of proper government revenue vanished-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Assessed government taxes, that people owed them, they know who it is and it just vanished because they can't collect it.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Eight billion dollars.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Eight billion dollars last year.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That's a lot of money.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, it's real. Well, start a billion here a billion there.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: You could probably build a wall with that.\n\nHello, and welcome to \"Why Is This Happening?,\" with me your host, Chris Hayes. Do I sound a little different? Yes, I do. Because I'm sick. I'm getting over the flu. I'm sorry that you're going to have to suffer through my hoarse voice for this intro today. Get your flu shots, everyone. I got mine just for the record. Get them every year, but flu going around my flu defenses.\n\nAlso, before I get into the intro for today's show \u2014 if my voice can make it \u2014 I want to just tell you that there are some really important information at the end of the conversation, the end of the podcast, listen all the way through about, Stacey Abrams live with \"Pod\" in New York City, including a little ticket giveaway action. That's we do in the audio world. I am bummed that we can't take live calls. I would literally love nothing more than like a big call board. Just put people on the air. Like the phrase that pays.\n\nTIFFANY CHAMPION: The what?\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I just I said Tiffany, I said to Tiffany, \"Can we come up with a phrase that pays,\" she's like, \"The what?\" I was like, \"That's like a morning zoo trope.\"\n\nSo, The hottest club in politics right now, the hottest spot, the \u201cNight at the Roxbury,\u201d place you want to be at is taxing the rich. In democratic politics, that is where it is going down. Seemingly kind of all at the same time, you've got a million different proposals for taxing the rich. You've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez floating her 70 percent top marginal tax rate, which would take us back to rates we haven't really seen since mid-century. You've got Elizabeth Warren's really fascinating wealth tax idea, which is totally novel, has not been done in the US except \u2014 as I'm fond of pointing out \u2014 for every single person that pays property taxes every year.\n\nIf you're listening this, and you pay property taxes, you already pay a wealth tax. Look at that. The wealth tax exists. This would be a wealth tax for people who have over $50,000,000 in wealth. For most people, most of their wealth is the property they own. The vast majority of Americans, the majority, the overwhelming part of their wealth is the property they own that they do pay a wealth tax on every year. People up at the top $50,000,000 in holdings, they do not pay a wealth tax. So, you could look at as a just kind of an equity sort of situation. You've got Brian Schatz out of Hawaii, who I think is going to introduce, or has introduced a financial transaction tax, which is a very popular idea that's kicked around sort of progressive think tank circles for every stock or financial transaction, a very, very small amount of money to tax that, a lot of people think would have both good benefits on the finance world because it would get rid of a lot of hot money moving in and out of places.\n\nYou got Bernie Sanders got a new thing to tax rich estates. He wants to raise taxes on really, really, really big estates. I think we'll see more, and more, and more of this to come. Here's one really interesting question that comes up with all these proposals, and it was I think, the first question I asked Elizabeth Warren when she was on \"All In\" about this proposal: her wealth tax. It's not a question about is this morally justified? Or is this substantively attractive? Though there's a debate over that. It's not a question about the incentives it might create, right? Because there's debate about that, right? If you tax people's wealth, maybe they'll stop working, or they won't ... they'll just sleep till 11 a.m. rather than getting up at nine and creating jobs the first two hours a day, or something like that.\n\nThis sort of ridiculous incentive argument taken to with logical and absurd extreme. No, the first question, the first question a lot of people have, the first question I have for Elizabeth Warren is, can you do this? And I don't mean can you do it constitutionally \u2014 though that's a question \u2014 I mean can you literally get the wealthy people to pay? There's all these proposals floating around there and what you see is a widespread, totally earned, totally grounded-in-reality skepticism of like, okay you're going to pass a tax hike on the rich in theory, making air quotes, but aren't you actually going to get the rich people to pay their taxes? Because in the America I live in I'm not super confident that you can do that because they sure as hell seem to get away with avoiding a lot of taxes, and like the President of the United States who has been in the public spotlight for the entirety of his career, and who has been, quote, under audit forever.\n\nSure seems like maybe not a guy who's like doing his utmost to pay all the taxes that are due. So okay yes, let's tax the rich. Let's agree for a second, stipulate it's not a consensus agreement American life, but it's actually quite popular in the polling. But let's say yes, as a policy matter, taxing the rich at higher rates in different and new ways is a big part of combating the rising inequality. That's the kind of interesting ideological policy dispute. But the much more fundamental, and in some ways important, though arguably more boring, discussion to have is literally do we have an IRS that can do that? Is there a capacity on the part of our government to do that?\n\nThat question is as profound a question about where we are as a civilization as you can ask. The ability of a state to effectively tax its most powerful wealthy members is a threshold question of the integrity, health, and vibrancy of that state. Going back years, thousands of years, going back all through history, time and time again, huge fights erupting between the state, often represented by the king or the Emperor and say, the landowners, who don't like to pay tons of taxes. This is a key line of conflict, political conflict, throughout civilization in history. As a key question about the health, vibrancy, efficacy of a state of whether it can pull it off. Can you make the very, very rich people in your society pay taxes to the Public Treasury?\n\nAnd often the answer to that is, no. In many different states throughout history, and around the world right now, the answer is no. In fact, we've seen this massive explosion in overseas tax dodgers, and something we've talked about a little bit in this program. The question right now before the U.S. is, what kind of country is the U.S.? What kind of civilization is the U.S.? Is it the kind of country that still has the power to effectively tax its richest members? The answer to that question makes up the substance of today's conversation with a great reporter,. He's a senior reporter and editor at ProPublica. He wrote a great book about Wall Street, and the financial crisis, and the Obama administration called \"The Chickenshit Club.\" He has embarked on this reporting project with ProPublica about the nature of the IRS, and the really unnerving ways in which systematically corporate interests, the Republican Party, the wealthy folks, the wealthy anti-tax zealots that fund the Republican Party and fund much of the conservative movement have succeeded in gutting the capacity of the IRS to do this elemental thing: collect taxes. Not exclusively the very rich, but most problematically has gut the ability of the IRS to collect taxes from the very rich.\n\nIn fact, as you'll hear this conversation has changed the focus of the IRS in who they go after and who they audit, from the very rich to the working poor. Over the last decade or more, kind of in front of our faces, but below our gaze, there has been an effective and concerted effort by Republican appropriators, industry lobbyists groups and the wealthy to basically break the legs of the IRS to make it an ineffective watchdog, and an ineffective agency at doing the one thing it exists to do, which is collect taxes to fund the United States government. Before you get to the fun and exciting policy debate questions of Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or all the fights that are going to happen over the course of this Democratic primary in which taxing the rich will be an absolutely central part of the platform. No question. It'll be a central part of debates. It'll be a central part of the Democratic Party platform, it'll be a thing everyone's talking about.\n\nBefore you get to that, you have to have an agency that can actually pull off the policy, you have to conceive of, design and fund ways of making the IRS the kind of agency that can do what you're asking it to do in your policy papers.\n\nToday's conversation is all about what those in power, and those with wealth, who know what they're doing, what they have already done behind the scenes in the bowels of the legislative process to make it so the IRS cannot effectively collect taxes from wealthy people.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Collecting taxes is one of maybe the two most core functions.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Like, it's like it's right there. It's like, you've got the army. You've got the taxes. You've got a state.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right. We wanted to make this point that people have been worried about the health of our democracy, and we wanted to make the point that before you have a democracy, you have to have a functioning tax collection system. And we are in jeopardy-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Meaning you have to have a state.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: You need a state, and the state needs to be funded, and the state needs to collect taxes and then the tax collection needs to seem, in some way, to be equitable.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Tax evasion, the inability to collect taxes, is a feature throughout history of essentially failed or failing states.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Exactly. Yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right? Whether that's because of corruption or legitimacy issues, right? I'm not going to pay the king my taxes. I'm a feudal lord because I don't view the king as legitimate anymore. Next thing you know, we have a succession fight.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: My wife and I traveled to Apulia in the heel of the boot of Italy this summer, and they have these strange elf-like structures called trulli all dotting the landscape. They're really beautiful, and they don't have any mortar in them, and the reason they don't have any mortar in them is they were a regency of the Spanish hundreds of years ago, and the Prince didn't want the structures to be stable because the tax system was based on how many edifices you had in your region. And so when he got wind of the Spanish tax collectors, he had all the farmers dismantle-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Knock them down?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, dismantle them, and so you could build up your trulli and knock them down.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It's like your property tax assessor coming out once a year, and you just razing your house. Just like, \"Buddy, I don't know what to tell you. Nothing here.\"\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right. I had a lean-to and then I took it down. But, you know, soon after, the Spanish lost Italy.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, that's the point. There's a connection here. There's a deep connection between the ability of the state to collect taxes both from a kind of technical standpoint and the standpoint of legitimacy that gets to the heart of the vibrancy and health of a state.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right. So successive IRS commissioners have warned we don't want to be Greece or Italy now, today, where they don't have a functioning tax system, and the more people understand that they don't have a functioning tax system, the more people won't pay it, and then you get into a spiral where it's very difficult to get out of.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: You then become a sucker. This is one of these things where there's a real race to the bottom. There's real pure effects. We see it in corruption all the time, right? If everyone's taking bribes, you become a sucker not taking a bribe. When you put a person who is generally honest and has integrity in an environment where no one is taking bribes, he or she doesn't take bribes, but you put them in an environment where everyone's taking a bribe, you start to feel like, \"What am I, an idiot? Everyone's taking a bribe. I'm going to take a bribe.\"\n\nSame thing goes for taxes. If it becomes the case that you look around, it's like no one's paying their taxes and everyone's cheating, and everyone's getting away with it, that will convert people into being cheaters who wouldn't otherwise be cheaters.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah. It licenses a kind of behavior, and you've seen this from Trump with the reason we are seeing so many scandals at cabinet officers is that he's licensed this kind of behavior, corruption. We had no corruption scandals under Obama. None. And I think they were more honest people, but there wasn't this pure change from complete honesty to total dishonesty.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: My favorite example of this is David Shulkin, who is a natural experiment, who literally was an Obama deputy cabinet official, no scandals. Becomes the head of the V.A. under Trump, and all of a sudden it's like Wimbledon tickets and all sorts of other stuff.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Exactly. I completely agree with you.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So you've been doing this. You're an investigative reporter. You're kind of writing this really fascinating book about white collar criminal prosecutions, and you've undertaken this reporting project on the IRS.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: First, and we're going to talk about what has happened to the IRS, which is utterly scandalous. Utterly scandalous, and everyone should be outraged about. Before we get to that though, what is the IRS? What is it and what does it do?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Well, as everybody knows, it collects taxes. It collects taxes from large corporations, and small corporations, and individuals. It also polices our tax laws, so they investigate tax fraud. There's legal tax avoidance, then there's tax evasion, and the IRS is on the civil side trying to uncover tax avoidance, telling people that they owe more money, and then there's illegal tax evasion that they investigate and then refer to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Oh, so this is an interesting distinction. So tell me more. Tax avoidance is you \u2014 either through accident or overly aggressive accounting \u2014 reduce your tax burden.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: It's not accidental.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, okay. So these are not mistakes.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: No, these are not mistakes. This is Google moving billions of dollars of profit abroad because they have moved IP to Ireland.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Everyone's favorite country to hold IP in.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes, and they get expensive lawyers and expensive accountants to design these in ways that, they argue, comply with the law or within the four corners of the law, and then the IRS says, \"No, it's not,\" or \"We don't agree with your interpretation. We're going to argue with you about it.\" And they have an argument, and then they come up with, \"We've audited you, and you owe us X amount of money.\" Mostly that's in the legal realm.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I mean, what's key about that is that's not subterfuge. They're kind of clear about what they're doing. It's a dispute between the very wealthy tax lawyers for the very wealthy corporations, and the tax authority about what exactly is legal.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right. Right. I mean, there's an enormous amount of subterfuge going on, and there's enormous amount of obfuscation. They're designed to be extremely complicated. They'll fundamentally change the substance of an economic transaction.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And the question then that the IRS faces in those contexts ... We're talking about those behemoth corporations doing all this very complicated tax evasion is what's the line of what's clever but legal, or just a facial violation of the law.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: To give these corporations their due in this particular case, there's a lot of stuff that's arguable that really wouldn't be criminal. You couldn't really appropriately think of criminality. Criminality is knowledge of forethought. You know something was wrong and you did it anyway, and so the IRS-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Like Paul Manafort just comes to mind.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Why would you say that? Yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Like a person that I associate with that just being super, hella into crimes, being like \"This is criminal. This is super criminal. I'm criming it up.\"\n\nJESSE EISINGER: I mean, there are a variety of names you could come up with. Michael Cohen is another name that springs to mind.\n\nMichael Cohen, former personal attorney to President Donald Trump, exits federal court on Nov. 29, 2018 in New York City. Drew Angerer / Getty Images file\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. Yeah, also in mind.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes. Both tax evaders-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yes, good point.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: By the way, but also bank fraudsters, and an orgy of criminality for those guys. But, yeah, so then there's crime. And the IRS, there's actually debates about whether the IRS should have a criminal enforcement operation. It's actually a kind of poor relation to the rest of the service. They don't really get along, and one of the things that we've found is that the referral system, where the auditors come in and they look at something and they say, \"Boy, this actually crosses the line here\"-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: They ring a bell. They're like, \"We've got ourselves a Manafort!\"\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah. Well, they're supposed to, but it's actually collapsed, and so they hardly do that anymore.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Oh, that's interesting.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, so they hardly ever refer cases over to the criminal section.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And it's an enormous bureaucracy. I mean, collecting the nation's taxes for the United States of America-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: It's certainly one of the biggest, and it's got a $12 billion budget now, and tens of thousands of employees, and touches every aspect of our lives, and is one of the most hated bureaucracies. You're talking about how boring it is. The reporting on it is extraordinarily boring. I've reported on anti-trust economics, and collateralized debt obligations, and bank stress tests, and this was some of the most excruciatingly dull reporting to do.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Amazing.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: And so hard.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Jesse is weirdly blushing while he's telling me this.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Maybe I'm just warm. Yeah, yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It's a shameful secret how bored he's been by his own fantastic IRS reporting.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Oh, well, thank you.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: This is a thing that I feel like anyone who's listening to the podcast who's a lawyer or who has gone through law school is like ... Everyone says \"Take tax law. Take tax law. It's a really important area of the law. Massively important area of the law.\" Incredibly lucrative area of the law for people that get very good at it or go into it.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: But it's crushing when you're sitting there in class.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Years and years ago, somebody said to me the greatest thing that could happen to you in law school is to find out that you fell in love with tax law.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, because you've got to take it.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: You have a lifetime employment and you'll be a very wealthy person.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So what you're reporting is about the sort of what has happened to the IRS over the last how long?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Really, eight years. We go through a little bit of the history here because the IRS has been vilified by the right, but relatively recently. Really only since the 90s.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah. It was a big Gingrich thing. I remember it was a big Gingrich thing.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right. But this effort from the Republican party started with the Tea Party Congress in 2011 to really go after the IRS and start gutting it. So there's some history there, but this effort to cut the budget and relentlessly cut the budget started in 2011 and really hasn't stopped.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So you've got a rhetorical attack where they're sort of a useful punching bag. Like, \"Who likes the IRS?\" Before that. But there's a kind of plan put in place to really attack it as an institution and to make it weaker, right? To weaken the service.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah. Deliberately weaken the service.\n\nSo, before the 1990s, it was basically a kind of consensus that we have to have a functioning tax collection system. And then in the 1990s, the Republican party is kind of having a debate about how to cut taxes, and there are the \"flat taxers,\" and then there is the-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Steve Forbes. God bless him.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right, and then \"fair tax.\" The fair tax is a consumption tax. The benefit, supposedly, from the fair tax guys, is you can abolish the IRS, and it becomes a kind of catchphrase. Gingrich uses it in \"Contract with America,\" and then they actually go after the IRS and successfully really cripple it for a number of years with some extraordinary hearings. They are these dramatic hearings where IRS supposed whistleblowers and people who were audited were testifying behind screens with disguised voices because of the supposed retribution from the jackbooted thugs at the IRS.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow. These are hearings that Gingrich\u2019s Congress stages?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: These are, yes, senate hearings, and they are very high profile. Then they pass a, quote-unquote, \"reform bill\" that passes unanimously in the senate. Clinton eagerly signs it, and it completely decimates the enforcement and collectionability of the IRS for years. Then the GAO does a report saying, actually, we couldn't corroborate any of the hearing witnesses. There's nothing ... So one of the things was that the IRS had stormed in, guns blazing. There was a slumber party with teenage girls, and they made the teenage girls get dressed in front of the agents. So there was this lascivious stuff.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: This is one of the whistleblowers?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: This is one of the whistleblowers' stories saying the house of my manager of my restaurant was raided, and guns blazing, and they had the teenage boys lie facedown on the ground, the teenage girls at the slumber party were changing their clothing, and all this kind of depredations from the IRS. Not true. False. It only sort of came after this reform bill.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That had passed unanimously in the senate and signed by Bill Clinton.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Passed unanimously and signed by Bill Clinton.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That bill-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: That bill did a lot of arcane bureaucratic reorganizations for the IRS, but then prevented them from freezing assets of tax cheats, so that collapses.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I see.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: So audits collapse after that, the budget goes down slightly and collections go way down, and asset freezes go down and basically never recover. But the collections, and the audit rate, and the budget does recover for the 2000s, and then the Tea Party Congress comes in and they are very focused. And they start cutting.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And what do they start doing?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: They start cutting the budget. So right away in 2000, their first bill which is a budget bill, they call for a huge $600 million cut for the IRS budget. They only get their $600 million cut later, but they do make a cut in 2011 and 2012. And then in 2013, there's the Lois Lerner quote-unquote \u201cscandal,\u201d and if you remember that ... And we didn't mention, you asked me what does the IRS do? Well, one of the things it does is police non-profits who, of course, are exempt from paying taxes if you fulfill certain criteria, and there's a boom in Tea Party groups, political groups, C4s, that can't predominantly do political activity and also claim tax exemption.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. So just to be clear here, right? So people are probably familiar with the idea of a 501(c)(3). A 501(c)(3) is both tax deductible and tax exempt. Your local food pantry is a 501(c)(3).\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It doesn't pay taxes. Also, if you give them $500, you can write that off your own taxes. That's tax deductible. 501(c)(4) is adjacent. It's not tax deductible, right?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: You can't deduct it off your taxes if you give them money, but they don't pay taxes.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And they're kind of a weird category.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: I mean, it's an infernally complex set of rules that have to do with how much ... So the (c)(3)s are not allowed to participate in policymaking, lobbying or political activity at all. The (c)(4)s are not allowed to be predominantly involved in political activity.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And that \"predominantly\" does a lot of work.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: And it does a lot of work, exactly. So that scandal, the short story and it's very complicated, is that the IRS is this little operation, the tax exempt operation of the IRS, which is another tiny backwater to what they're actually doing. They're deluged by groups especially with names like Tea Party Patriots and things like that, and they start trying to figure out how to verify whether these groups are participating in activities that will prevent them from being tax exempt, and that becomes one of the big Obama administration scandals.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right, so they blow this up. Basically, what you've got is this interpretational question that's a difficult one, which is whether a 501(c)(4) is on which side of the line of being predominantly doing essentially politics by another name, in which case it can't be tax exempt, or whether it's not predominantly doing that. A bunch of these groups get created because there's all kinds of changes that are happening in campaign finance as well, and you've got this little elf in the IRS that's trying to distinguish \"Are these guys on the right side of the line or not?\" Essentially.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And this gets turned into Lois Lerner who becomes a villain of this, and Barack Obama's IRS is unconstitutionally trying to destroy Tea Party groups.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes, the Obama Administration, like Nixon, is using the IRS as a vehicle to punish political enemies.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: I should've said, before all this happens, as we pointed out that the Republicans were targeting the IRS. Well, it wasn't just because they don't like the IRS and they don't like tax enforcement. It's because the ACA, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare \u2014 it's a little known aspect of it \u2014 that it's a major tax bill, and most of the implementation of the ACA fell to the IRS, and the Republicans understood it-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Perfectly. So what they wanted to do, what they had obviously failed to-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Prevent-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Stop the passage of the ACA, so what they wanted to do was a backdoor way of preventing payments to put the ACA in place, to implement the ACA.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right because of the structure of the thing with the subsidies. All that's happening through the IRS, right?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Subsidies, mandate-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: A huge number of things.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Of course.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: And the IRS was tasked with this huge, huge new responsibility, and what they were doing was they were cutting the budget as they were ladling more-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. So the ACA-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Burdening the IRS with more and more stuff.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: The ACA basically dumps enforcement into the IRS's lap effectively.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I mean, the mechanics of the individual exchange is that the mandate, which again, is a tax, right?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Is a tax penalty the IRS is going to enforce.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: The subsidy calculations. The IRS is calculating that, right?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: They're the ones that are running that whole thing. So you've given the IRS basically-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: A huge, huge amount of enforcement and implementation responsibility, no added budget, and in fact the opposite where they're cut.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So they don't like the IRS to begin with, they don't like taxes to begin with, they don't like government bureaucrats to begin with.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Let's also be clear. The rich donor class that funds the Republican party really doesn't like the IRS.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: No, they really don't, and the best thing to do is to get their taxes cut, but second best is to have no tax enforcement of the existing laws and rules.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Exactly. And in some ways, at a certain point they sort of asymptotically approach each other. I remember this stat that kept happening during the last tax bill, which was about the corporate tax rate, and they kept saying, \"The US is the highest corporate tax rate in the world.\" Which was true. Absolutely true. All of these countries on paper.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: And meaningless.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And meaningless because what was paid, what was it, 35 percent?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: 35 percent was the headline number, and the effective tax rate was-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: 14 percent.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Vastly lower.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Something like that.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: 14 percent for in aggregate, but bigger companies paid much more.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And people would say that all the time, and I would just kind of be like, \"Well, that's a big difference.\" I'm a person who pays taxes, and the thing that's on the tax chart is more or less what I pay.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: There sure as hell isn't a 12 percentage point difference, I can tell you that, or 20 percentage point difference.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, absolutely. And a story that we're working on that I can preview, my colleague Paul Keil and I have been working on these stories together, is about corporate taxation and corporate tax enforcement, and the biggest corporations pay lower effective tax rates than medium sized corporations and smaller corporations because of course they can pay for lawyers and the accounts. So the bigger you are, the lower your tax bill.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Okay, so we've got this perfect storm. The Tea Party doesn't like the IRS anyway, the donor class doesn't like it, the ideologues don't like it, the big corporations who are funding them don't like it. They've now got more work to do because of ACA-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: A lot more work. And then this Lois Lerner \"scandal\" happens.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So it's like this perfect, \"Oh, look at these bad guys.\"\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right. And there's another scandal where they're supposedly going to conventions and partying and lavishly spending.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Was that the muffin?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes, yes. I'm blanking on the details of it, but costumes-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It was like, there was some $50 muffin somewhere at some-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, yeah. It's all-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: There's a video.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: There's a video. Now I'm blanking-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Like, some dumb, meme-y video, meme-esque meaning-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes. They had actually cut the ... The amount of spending on the conferences had dramatically been cut because it was the first thing to be cut from the budget cuts itself, but it blew up in a scandal anyway. I mean these were pretexts to attack the IRS, and the tax exempt portion is a tiny portion of the budget, but they attacked the overall budget, and the result was tens of thousands of people left $2 billion of the budget in real terms is gone from the IRS.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: $2 billion of what it was-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Like a $14 billion agency is now a $12 billion agency, and now-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: People need to understand, in a world in which budget generally, both because of inflation and also because size and complexity tend to increase over time, a real cut of $2 billion from a $14 billion agency is a massive, massive, massive cut.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: It's a massive cut, and it's significantly more than most of the other agencies. Most of the other agencies have slowly crept back in budget, and not the IRS. So they're continuing to starve, particularly the enforcement arm. There was a little bit of money that went to try to enforce the Trump tax overhaul, which is yet another enormous task that the IRS has been given that they don't have the manpower for, but no added money for enforcement. So now, today, there are fewer auditors. The number of auditors is fewer than 10,000 people. That's the lowest number since any time since 1953, the year Stalin died.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: In absolute terms, there are fewer auditors in the IRS than there were in any time since 1953.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: In actual human beings.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: When the economy was a seventh of the size that it is today.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So then what happens? What is the effect, then, on the agency?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: So it's an agency on life support. It's really been gutted. What it's meant is that they don't do the business that they used to do. The main thing that they are supposed to do is audit, and the audit rate has collapsed. It's down 42 percent.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And again, the logic here is ... I guess kind of an obvious point, but it's worth stating. It's kind of like the speed limit, right? We know what the speed limit is. A lot of people speed in a gray zone-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: The same way that I imagine a lot of people maybe take some deductions they shouldn't on their taxes, things like that. There's things in the region of the gray area, and the reason that you've got cops and state highway patrol is to create some fear of enforcement.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right. You need to-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And you just got rid of all of them, speeding would go up.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, yeah. You need to have a public display of enforcement, and they explicitly talked about this, they completely understand it. We need to do a certain number of audits and be public about them to prevent tax evasion, and now-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And that's the idea of the audit, right?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: The audit is done as, you're trying to get kind of a peak efficiency, which is the same way you don't want state highway patrol every two miles on the same highway, which would be massively expensive and would probably bring speeding down, but that would be overkill. You want some critical mass of auditors and audits such that people fear breaking the law enough to incentivize compliance.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, there's a reason why often you see the police car on the highway.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Great point. That's right.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: They're not just there to catch speeders, but to get everybody to slow down.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. And if you're like me, who never speeds obviously, you do not certainly jam on the brakes going 75 as the car comes into view-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Who would do that?\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So that you slow down to the correct speed, and then gun it again.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Well you don't have to have done that because the cars ahead of you have slowed down.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: So yes, it's really important. But another important fact of this is that I, and I don't know about you, but people who get W2s don't cheat on their taxes. Compliance rate is like, 99 percent, and the reason is not that middle class people are honest, it's that we're sending-\n\nUS tax form 1040 manop1984 / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nCHRIS HAYES: There's nothing to do.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: The money is withheld and the government already knows about it.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right. So if you're a normal ... let's say just a normal wage earner, there's not much to do.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: No.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: The government's got it-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: You have very little wiggle room.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, and in fact, most people I know in the realm of normal wage earners, and this has certainly been my, as a wage earner for my life, you get a refund. Sometimes you'll hear someone didn't file taxes for several years, and it's like, if you're doing a refund, the IRS doesn't care that much if you don't file.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: They're just going to keep your money. So the way the system, which, do you know who came up with the system?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: I don't.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Oh, this is a really fun piece of trivia.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Milton Friedman.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Oh, the EITC?\n\nCHRIS HAYES: No.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Or just the refund system?\n\nCHRIS HAYES: No, the taking it directly out of the paycheck up front.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: I didn't know that.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Is a Milton Friedman idea. But there's a grand irony, which is that this brilliant means of essentially ensuring tax compliance, which is that the taxes are paid in your paycheck, because think about it, if it wasn't there, and I've also been an independent contractor, and man, is that ... I mean, all the independent contractors out there right now are nodding their head because the first year you file as an independent contractor, and you've been getting these checks, and you've been like, \"Oh, there's some tax liability. I should probably be putting some away for the taxes.\"\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Oh, yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: \"Just pay a little taxes, but we'll figure it out later.\" And then you file your taxes, and it's like, \"You owe $2200.\" And it's like, \"I'm sorry. Excuse me. What? I don't have any money, literally. The alternator on my car broke and I can't pay for that.\"\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, that shock.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: \"I don't have $2200 to give you.\" And that's why the wage earning system is so far superior for everyone, and also in terms of compliance.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, although you probably needed a better accountant there. But yes, exactly. And the super wealthy of course don't earn wages, and that's where the tax evasion is and tax avoidance. And so the IRS needs to audit those people and they don't anymore, nearly to the degree that they used to.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So one of the points you're reporting is that this sort of retrenchment that's happened has had these distributional effects.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yes.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And this is really one of the most perverse lessons here, which is basically the smaller amount of auditors have been going after the bottom of the wage scale as opposed to the people at the very top.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: This is one of the great outrages is that the audit rate for the wealthy and for the affluent has collapsed much more quickly than the audit rate for the working poor. So people who get EITC, the earned income tax credit, they actually have a better chance of being audited than people making up to $500,000 a year.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Oh, come on.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: They have a higher audit rate than the affluent. Only the super wealthy get audited at a higher rate than people making $20,000 a year. So the auditing of the working poor has become something that the IRS does more than it ever did before. Its risen as a proportion of its overall audits to 36 percent of what they do. Their total audits are for people making roughly $20,000 a year. So why is this? Well, the earned income tax credit is something that Milton Friedman was a pioneer of, and it's we give people who are working but not making much money, and it really is roughly ... it can go up to $30,000 for a family, but it's mostly, on average, about $20,000 a year. We give them a tax credit. We send them a check.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And this is why, by the way, in neighborhoods with that socioeconomic income strata, like tax refund time of the year is an enormously important part of the year, it essentially represents a massive fiscal stimulus to the neighborhood-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Absolutely.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: To families, to overdue debts that people paid, medical debt, buying new clothes, wait until that period. That's why you have the whole scam of these operations charging these outrageous usurious rates on advanced refund loans, right?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Oh yes.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Because people need that money.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: There's an enormous amount of scamming. One of the things that Paul Keil, my colleague, has pointed out, which is just mind blowing is that in the spring, February, March is when personal bankruptcy filings go way up. They skyrocket. And it's because the poor finally have money from the earned income tax credit to pay for a bankruptcy lawyer.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: This is a crucial aspect of the year and people get sometimes $2000, $3000. If you're making $20,000, it's 10-15 percent of your overall income for the year, and even though this was a Republican conservative idea initially, and has had bipartisan political support in its inception, the Republicans have turned against it, and they've attacked it, and they've relentlessly attacked the IRS for not policing the supposed fraud in the EITC. So the IRS has responded to this relentless political pressure by continuing to do these audits. Also, these audits are much easier to do-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah, they're easy.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: They're automated letters. When you audit a super wealthy person, that person might have trusts and foundations and overseas operations and LLCs and all sorts of interlocking ownership and gift tax, and you need a human being or human beings to look at that. It's incredibly work intensive and time consuming. Those EITC audits can go very quickly. So that's why people are audited at a higher rate. Now, the working poor is audited at a much higher rate than even people making, as I say, up to $400,000 a year. There are people who don't file their taxes. The IRS used to go after them, they're called non-filers, and they used to go after about two million a year, and now they go after about 300,000 a year.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow. These are non-filers who are not owed a refund, we should note.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, not owed a refund.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Non-filers not owed a refund, they owe taxes, and the IRS doesn't even chase them down.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wow. They used to do two million. Now they're doing 300,000.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It's like you can just role the dice and not file your taxes.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Well, we have tax lawyers in the article saying it's a great time to cheat on your taxes. Tax debts expire after 10 years. Roughly several hundred million used to expire in 2011 on average in years past. Now it's eight billion in the most recent year.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Wait a second. What you're telling me is that eight billion dollars of proper government revenue vanished.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Assessed government taxes. People owed them. They know who it is and it just vanished because they can't collect it.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Eight billion dollars.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Eight billion dollars last year.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: That's a lot of money.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah. A billon here, a billion there.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: You could probably build a wall with that.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: And have money leftover.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: I don't know about concrete, but steel. So the big beneficiaries are the wealthy and giant corporations. The audit rate for giant corporations has plummeted. It used to be that the IRS continuously audited all large corporations every single year. And in fact the percentage of large corporations that were being audited was over 100 percent because many large corporations were being audited for multiple years at a time. Now it's down to about 80 percent. So now big companies are not even audited every year, but that actually masks how bad it is because the audits have become much thinner. So there are fewer auditors assigned to each large corporation and they look at fewer issues. So they've tried to come up with these efforts to deal with the budget cuts and one is kind of announcing campaigns. We're going to look at this issue, we're going to look at that issue.\n\nSo they don't really audit the entirety of a tax return anymore. They just kind of focus in on one or two issues. Reinsurance. A reinsurance scam, and whether you're doing that. So if you're a corporation, you look at those things and clean up those areas and then go on and it obviously incentivizes taking big risks-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right because it's all just ... Because this is basically all civil, right? At the corporate level, it's mostly all civil.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: It's worse than that because it's all civil and even though the civil side has the ability to assign penalties for being aggressive about the taxes, basically the IRS doesn't like to penalize companies. And so even when they-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Well that's nice of them I guess.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: It's lovely of them. That makes the fight over the tax bill even harder and they're looking to resolve these disputes and so they back away from penalties. And so if you're a corporation, the present value of money is pretty important. If you have to pay a tax bill today or you can pay it in 10 years with no penalties, same amount, why would you not?\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And if they're not going to assess fines, you're just running a cost benefit about compliance.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, exactly.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: There's no moral duty that's entering here and there was no criminal exposure unless you're doing something really gnarly.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right. There is no moral duty, although there is a norm of behavior that ... We were just talking to an Oregon economist, Kim Clausing, the other day who was pointing out that companies didn't always act this way. And that in fact some companies use to kind of take pride in paying taxes. And in Japan you see this a lot where companies actually do take pride in how much they're paying in, because they think, \"We are big contributors to society.\"\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Right.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: And so the norm around corporate taxation has really collapsed. It started in the eighties and nineties where tax departments transformed from places where you had to pay your taxes that figured out how much tax you had to pay to profit centers. And that really kind of GE was the pioneer of this, Jack Welch. And then many, many companies, most companies followed this where they expected their tax department to be a profit center. And because of that, now they see tax avoidance as their obligation to shareholders. Because we have an idea that companies are supposed to be only run for the shareholders.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And this is all happening, and the other thing that's happening here and the sort of global sense is this massive ... We saw some of it in the Panama papers. We've seen economists increasingly talking about this, that just the rise of the global network of tax havens and the inability of states, not just the U.S., across both the OACD and outside of it, to collect taxes on the richest citizens who now have this extremely vibrant, burgeoning industry that exists in the world of places to park tax free dollars.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, exactly. So, the Obama administration actually cracked down on this. They passed a law. Congress passed a law very quickly with relatively little debate called FATCA. FATCA required American citizens to reveal any overseas money they had, any overseas bank accounts. And moreover, they required banks, overseas banks to report to the IRS how many accounts they had from American citizens. This was a kind of game changing law. Very far reaching. And there's been zero enforcement and implementation of it eight years later because of the budget cuts.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: They just don't enforce the law?\n\nJESSE EISINGER: So they do not enforce the law. So the IRS essentially has no capacity to get the banks to comply with the law. And banks have deluged the IRS with information in a way that is unusable, and the IRS doesn't go through it.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: So you can just keep your stuff hidden.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right. Now what happened was they have moved it. So the impetus for FATCA was breaking the back of Swiss bank secrecy in the aftermath of the great financial crisis.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah. I want to stop you there because I want to tell a funny story. The Swiss bank secrecy, which is that I was taken on a junket to Switzerland. It must've been 2009 or 2010 by this young American Swiss Foundation. It's a nonprofit that believes in Swiss-American partnership. It was actually started by a former ... Reagan's ambassador to Switzerland. A really interesting woman named Faith Wittlesey. And they brought us there and it was this incredibly lux trip and it was us, some Americans and some Swiss. Young leaders. Different industries, really interesting folks. Water hydrologists and then corporate folks and dancers and a member of parliament and things like that. And one of the first nights we were in Geneva and it was the head of the Swiss bankers association, who I think paid for our dinner and gave us a long speech about how great the Swiss banking system is. How it basically gets a bad rap, particularly after 9/11. But like, \"Really it's a great system. We all have personal liability for what we do and that's like the check.\" That was his big thing. \"We all have personal liability so trust us, we're not doing anything untoward and it's really important that\u2026\u201d\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Certainly could trust them to keep your money.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Preserve the Swiss banking system. I just remember saying, \"This is not a subtle play here.\"\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, I mean it is one of the kind of unsung stories of the Obama administration. I'm very critical of. And they were not good about cracking down on corporations, but they did actually do this kind of incredible thing with Swiss bank secrecy. And then they pass FATCA in response to figuring out that all these Americans had secret bank accounts in Switzerland, and then because there's been no enforcement, there has been no reduction of overseas money at all.\n\nSo Gabriel Zuckerman, a Berkeley economist, calculates this and he says that all the money is just moved to places like Singapore. So there's been zero effect from this incredible enforcement effort, and new law, eight years later, 10 years later.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It sort of brings us to the more profound point here, which is a little bit of where we started about the equal justice under law idea. The idea of the law being equal to everyone. To the person making $20,000 and the person with $200,000,000 in assets. And also the existential question of whether a state can collect taxes. Whether the state is more powerful than it's wealthiest citizens or whether those wealthy citizens are more powerful than the state when it comes to the elemental question of whether they will pay for the state.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah, I think we are eroding the rule of law. We're eroding the basic legitimacy of our democracy through this, through not being able to collect our taxes, through a lack of corporate law enforcement, white collar enforcement, which is what my book is about. We talk about inequality in this country and most of the time we're talking about wealth and income inequality, but I think this impunity to commit crimes and impunity to evade your responsibilities as a citizen, that's a greater prerequisite.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: And your book, \"The Chickenshit Club,\" is about the Justice Department and the Obama administration really failing to pursue and prosecute white collar financial crimes. And a crisis.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Right, although I'm trying to make a broader argument, which is that this was not just about the financial crisis and not just about the big banks. That this was building before that and persistent today, and affects our ability to prosecute. We've lost the will and ability to prosecute top corporate executives from not just big banks, but pharmaceutical companies, industrial companies, tech companies. The list goes on. I think Mueller is pointing out that whole swathes of the economy are going unpoliced in white collar world.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: This is where I wanted to end up, which is that when you look at the Mueller stuff ... I mean Manafort and Cohen are great examples. Manafort's just doing this stuff out in the open. He's undertaking wildly sketchy and red flag raising financial and real estate transactions that WNYC reports on just from public records. They say, \"What's up with you buying an all cash brownstone then taking out a mortgage against that?\" No one does that except if they're money laundering, and then lo and behold, it shows up in the Manafort indictment that that's exactly what he was doing.\n\nPaul Manafort arrives at U.S. District Court in Washington on June 15, 2018. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters file\n\nAnd then you look through all the buildings, and all the apartments, and all of these towers that dot the skyline of the city of New York and Manhattan, blocks away from where we are, all purchased by LLCs, all sitting empty, all essentially places to park money and this sort of just general knowledge everyone has that, yes, these are all vehicles for people either to evade taxes or to launder money and this is a huge part of the money flows that come into the real estate markets in places like Miami and New York and it's a lot of foreign money. And this just kind of universe of like, yeah, that's just the way it is.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Yeah. I've realized that I actually underestimated the problem in my book. What Mueller's revealing is high-end real estate, campaign finance, corporate and political lobbying turned out to be rife with criminality are it's not policed.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yes. I think in the case of Manafort, who's been doing this out in the open and Michael Cohen, but then there's also the question of the president also just surrounded himself with crooks. It's a special group. I don't think if you just picked a bunch of people at random-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: I agree that there is a special group of criminals that he has surrounded himself with. But I think that if you ... There are also people like ... Skadden Arps partner pled guilty for doing a whitewash for an oligarch. For a report. Skadden Arps is as legitimate, as white shoe is against. They are a hyper degree version of what's going on. This is a technicolor version of what's going on every single day in corporate law enforcement. Big law exists now to do internal investigations of corporate wrongdoing. The dirty secret of corporate law enforcement is that the Department of Justice has outsourced its law enforcement to big law who do these internal investigations at the company. So the companies are enforcing themselves, paying for the enforcement of their own investigation of their own wrongdoing.\n\nSo yes, Manafort is particularly egregious. And how did he get away with it? Well, one of the ways he got away with it is that we've gutted law enforcement. Tax evasion law enforcement.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Yeah the guy was just evading taxes for a decade.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Blatant, blatant.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Just in front of everybody's face.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: It was not sophisticated. It was not complicated. It wasn't built on a lot of arcane and difficult-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: No he was just stealing from the government.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: He was stealing from the government. And so was Michael Cohen, just not reporting income and we don't audit-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Cohen's even-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: It's a simpler-\n\nCHRIS HAYES: It's simpler-\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Oh yeah. Much simpler. Yeah what are you talking about?\n\nCHRIS HAYES: I've got nothing.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Exactly. So how much is out there? I don't think we know. So the idea that only the people who Trump is surrounding himself with, I don't think we know. I just don't think we're policing these arenas whatsoever.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Jesse Eisinger is a Pulitzer Prize winner. Which by the way, nice work.\n\nJESSE EISINGER: Thank you.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Senior editor and reporter at ProPublica.

Robert \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke, D-Texas, has yet to formally announce his intent to run for the Democratic nomination, the local March for Truth he headlined like a rock star was a direct dig at President Trump\u2019s MAGA extravaganza happening down the road in El Paso. O\u2019Rourke, whose narrow loss to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, last year was perhaps the most success a statewide Texas Democrat could expect at this particular political moment, was on his home turf and defended his community in both English and Spanish, essentially telling the nation that we can be better.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, kept to his standard lies about El Paso and borders and criminal immigrants. Even though much of what he said about the Texas city was blatantly false \u2014 just ask El Paso\u2019s current Democratic Congresswoman and the city\u2019s Republican mayor \u2014 Trump seemingly feels that, as long as bunch of supporters scream in approval, that's all the proof of his veracity that anyone needs.\n\n\"I've been hearing a lot of things, 'Oh the wall didn't make that much of a difference.' You know where it made a big difference? Right here in El Paso,\" Trump said at the El Paso County Coliseum \"And I don't care if a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat, they're full of crap when they say it hasn't made a big difference.\"\n\nThere's plenty of evidence, however, that the effects on crime in El Paso have been marginal, and that increased border security in the city had simply shifted the locations that people attempt to make entry.\n\nThe truth, however, contradicts is what Trumpistas believe and what Trump has explicitly told them: That anyone who is from the Global South is just a cartel rapist terrorist ready to kill thousands of Americans. They will never be convinced otherwise.\n\nThere was nothing at Monday night's MAGA rally that Americans haven't seen before: Trump's made similar xenophobic remarks at the State of the Union, during a nationally-televised speech and in his first campaign speech ever in 2015 and, sadly, because this is America, he will always have an audience.\n\nEnter O\u2019Rourke, who took the game to Trump in El Paso, while the rest of the country\u2019s official Democratic presidential candidates watched from afar. The message from the city\u2019s former Congressman was as different from Trump\u2019s as it was sincere.\n\n\u201cWe are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance. We are going to show the country who we are. We're going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country,\" O\u2019Rourke said. \"We will not take advantage of [immigrants]. We will not send them back to certain death. We will not believe that walls can or should keep them out. Instead, we welcome them with open arms.\u201d\n\nThe message O\u2019Rourke shared was clear: El Paso is actually a bridge to Mexico and Central America. It doesn't need more walls because immigrants are not a threat to this country. Immigrants from the region are essential to the future of this country \u2014 and how we, as a nation, respond to the latest humanitarian crisis caused, in part, by our interventionist policies of the last decades will be a testament of how we will prosper in the 21st century.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s hopeful compassion all but canceled out Trump\u2019s insightful fear-mongering.\n\nYet it remains to be seen if other Democrats \u2014 especially those in D.C. right now \u2014 will take O\u2019Rourke\u2019s lead. As these two rallies were happening in El Paso, news of a bipartisan deal to avoid another shutdown, including money for barriers and ICE detention beds, broke.\n\nThe compromise deal was more Trump-like than O\u2019Rourke-like: It made no mention of expanding protections to DACA recipients, or saving Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from places like Honduras and El Salvador. Legislation to allow children whose parents brought them here without documentation to remain and work legally wasn't part of the arrangement; neither was pathway to citizenship for the millions of people who have been living and working here for decades.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her Green New Deal, introduced last week \u2014 and many already have. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called it a \"socialist manifesto,\" while Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., suggested such ideas \u201calways end with the Gestapo.\u201d Even Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the bill as \u201cthe green dream, or whatever they call it,\u201d saying the effort would be one of many ideas considered.\n\nThat isn\u2019t terribly surprising: Conventional thinking suggests that climate issues are a bit like taxes \u2014 they simply don\u2019t compel voter action. For example, consider the recent failure of fossil fuel ballot issues in both Washington and Colorado, states widely seen as liberal and pro-environmentalist policy.\n\nYet recent polling suggests that climate is growing in importance to voters everywhere, particularly as they see the effects manifest in their own backyards. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 69 percent of Americans are \u201cconcerned\u201d or \u201cvery concerned\u201d about climate issues. From apocalyptic wildfires in California to storms like Hurricane Harvey in Texas and coastal floods in Florida, most Americans will experience their own flavor of a changing climate and eventually expect some sort of action.\n\nAnd even corporate America is increasingly shifting its stance on climate change, its effects and causes. Major oil producers like Exxon Mobil have acknowledged the presence of climate change and even backed ideas such as a carbon tax. Meanwhile, California mega-utility Pacific Gas & Electric has been forced into bankruptcy, in large part due to the catastrophic wildfires in their coverage territory \u2014 fires driven by record winds, parched land and unusual fire patterns that have puzzled even veterans of the state\u2019s myriad weather patterns.\n\nPG&E\u2019s travails may turn out to be a key tipping point for industry by pushing climate change from a political and scientific debate to a clear operational threat. Executives will undoubtedly eventually face both boards of directors and shareholders who will want a plan for how climate change is being dealt with, and how their companies are protected against its effects.\n\nGranted, the rollout of Green New Deal legislation was rocky at best, but the term, \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, is still evolving. And, in a Congress that has functioned only from one short-term continuation resolution to another, the GND represents a bold moonshot that could jumpstart a new era of the legislative branch boldly leading.\n\nThe concept, after all, is the sort of bold, big-picture thinking that legislators of both parties could, and need to, embrace. While some of the foundational precepts it espouses are fundamentally unworkable, both politically and economically, the concept echoes the sort of go-for-broke mentality that built the Eisenhower Highway System, the Apollo Program and fueled the rise of the modern tech economy.\n\nBy embracing some of its more workable ideas, Republicans could do much good, for themselves and an American future. That\u2019s because, as energy writer Kate Aronoff stated recently, \u201cLike the first New Deal, then, the Green New Deal isn\u2019t a specific set of policies so much as a values framework under which any number of policies can fit\u201d.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal bill encompasses everything from substantial decarbonization of the economy to job retraining, guaranteed health care and infrastructure investment. But the chances of such a major body of legislation being passed wholesale are remote. More likely \u2014 particularly if Republicans and some Democrats wholesale dismiss the idea of a new green deal \u2014 it will simply serve as a Rosetta Stone of sorts for incoming legislators and generations of progressive voters.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez has already seemingly come to understand the daunting realities of implementing really broad changes. Wisely, she, along with supporters of the legislation, jettisoned environmentalist demands for a fossil fuel ban, a key tenant for interest groups (but a potential problem for her caucus and 2020 supporters) in favor of more moderate language.\n\nBesides which, it is a political and economic reality that several key battleground states (like Ohio, Pennsylvania and others) depend on fossil fuel-based industries, like coal and heavy manufacturing, for both jobs and tax revenue. So instead of pursuing the absolute end of these fossil fuels, demonizing their supporters or shutting them out of this conversation, the two parties could look for issues of common ground and do the hard work it takes to craft a compromise. Such an effort wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented: Congressional Republicans lifted the oil export ban, but also extended the production tax credit for solar energy in 2016.\n\nInstead of costly and vitriolic fights over banning one form of energy or another, the parties could agree to encourage investment in technology such as energy storage, which has been supported by new Republican FERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee, or to the creation of incentives for infrastructure resilience or updating and strengthening the electric grid.\n\nWhat\u2019s most unique (and largely overlooked) about the Green New Deal however, is that it uses energy policy as a catalyst for broader social and economic change \u2013 addressing the need for job retraining and providing incentives for those most likely to be affected by climate change, such as minority, elderly and other historically economically challenged communities.\n\nHere too is an opportunity for a new breed of Republican lawmakers to craft policy instead of talking points. For instance, the Opportunity Zones being championed by Republican Tim Scott seek a free market solution that incentivizes corporate investment while addressing the issue of income and economic development.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that some in the conservative ecosystem have chosen to make Ocasio-Cortez, and everything she proposes, the movement\u2019s b\u00eate noire \u2014 but if politicians wholesale follow their lead, they might well be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Working instead toward compromise legislation on climate change would at least allow conservatives and their allies a hand in crafting ideas and legislation they know and support, rather than taking a chance of having it forced upon them in future presidential administrations or activist courtrooms.\n\nIn an era where too many politicians think small, it\u2019s time to jump start our ability to dream big again together, and some sort of Green New Deal type policies could be a start."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/roger-northam-blackface-myth-color-blindness-america-ncna970241", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 11, 2019, 10:33 PM GMT / Updated Feb. 11, 2019, 11:09 PM GMT By Qasim Rashid\n\nFebruary is Black History Month in America. Maybe it is only fitting, then, that the past (few) weeks have focused so much attention on casual white racism. We\u2019re not talking about the open racism of neo-Nazis and or even the kinds of beliefs routinely spouted by bigoted politicians like Iowa Rep.

And just like people who claim they \u201cdon\u2019t see color,\u201d this kind of person believes themselves cured of racial bias.

And they have also done and said things that are racist \u2014 not racially tinged. No racially insensitive. But racist.\n\nNortham\u2019s alleged sin \u2014 dressing up in black face \u2014 happened decades ago. But as law professor and critical race theorist Khaled Beydoun reminds us, \u201c[It is a] myth that racism declines with time. [In] reality, racism fluidly adapts to prevailing social norms and political interests.\u201d Racism need not be a white supremacist wearing a hood. As times change, racism manifests in new ways \u2014 and the myth of color blindness is one of those ways.\n\nColor blindness \u2014 whether talking about the kind right-wing firebrand Tomi Lahren embraces, or the kind Liam Neeson implies when he says he isn\u2019t racist for wanting to kill a random black man \u2014 has become a common cover for racism. Unspoken or openly articulated, color blindness does not actually exist in the real world. People of color know this, of course. In reality, some people wear their racism on their sleeve, and others actively work to combat their prejudice. But many (if not most) people have lulled themselves into a false sense of security as far as their own racial biases are concerned.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nWhether the topic is American slavery or the warrantless spying on American Muslims, we will never be able to dismantle the systems of racial oppression if we cannot reckon with the way our past informs out future. Yes, this is an uncomfortable conversation, but it is one we must have with courage and confidence to confront.\n\nTo see the ways the past is made present we don\u2019t have to look very hard. Black Americans comprise around 13 percent of America\u2019s population yet make up around 40 percent of the prison population. Black and white Americans use marijuana at the same rates, but black Americans are charged and arrested at much higher rates than white Americans.\n\nIt isn\u2019t hyperbole to say 21st-century America has once again monetized black slave labor. The massively and disproportionately black and Latino prison labor force is paid pennies on the dollar for dangerous jobs like fire fighting \u2014 work they may be denied once released from incarceration. Clearly, the criminal justice system sees color.\n\nAs the great James Baldwin eloquently explained when asked why black people and people of color won\u2019t stop talking about race and just \u201cmove on:\u201d\n\nBaldwin spoke truth. Black Americans with similar educational degrees and qualifications generally earn $20,000 to $50,000 less than white Americans \u2014 a wage gap that has grown to a size not seen since the 1950s. The CDC reports that black mothers suffer a 325 percent greater maternal fatality rate than white mothers. The federal government enacted policies to deliberately create black ghettos, and to this day major banks continue to discriminate against black and Latino Americans. Clearly, those with economic power see color.\n\nAm I calling all white people racist? No. But I am pointing out that the current power structures still facilitate and perpetuate racially biased norms. There are plenty of kind, well-meaning, intelligent white people in power, and yet the aforementioned economic and practical injustices continue to exist.\n\nAs NBC News\u2019 Janell Ross wrote recently of Northam: \u201cAt no point, ever, did Northam describe himself as a reformed racist or his own decision to engage in what he at one point called 'face painting\u2019 as racist. Nor did he speak to the myriad ways in which racism infects American life in the present.\u201d\n\nNortham may now believe he did something wrong, but he doesn\u2019t necessarily view his actions as racist or part of a much bigger pattern.\n\nWhat does this tell us? It tells us that people of color deserve better from our leaders, of course. But it\u2019s also a reminder that complacency is the best way to ensure the cancer of racism continues to thrive in America. It should be unacceptable to anyone committed to national unity and racial understanding.\n\nCORRECTION (Feb. 11, 2019, 6 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified the governor of Virginia.

Henson\n\nPeople in the African-American community have long been afraid to talk about our mental health; we just don't do it. We're told to pray it away, we're told to be strong, we're told it's a sign of weakness or, a lot of times, mental health issues comes off as \"rage\" and is dismissed or ignored. There\u2019s shame and taboo around the topic.\n\nWe have to break that silence.\n\nWhat made me comfortable with talking about it was that my father had issues with mental illness, and he was very vocal about it. So I never thought there was something \"wrong\" with either having mental health challenges or talking about it. But then, when I grew up and had my own hardships \u2014 my own traumas \u2014 and it was time to deal with them head on, there was an issue: I couldn't easily find a therapist who really understood my challenges as an African-American.\n\nBecause mental health isn't talked about in our community, people don't seek it out as a career option. So we don't have a lot of therapists out there, and those who are practicing are not easy to find. I want to change that.\n\nBeyond that, in terms of looking for a therapist, it's not even about color or culture, but about a therapist being culturally competent. Cultural competence means knowing, understanding and honoring the history of someone. For instance, you might not know exactly what it is like to live in a crack-infested neighborhood, but you do need to understand what that does to a family structure. If you come from a biased place, if you blame any systemic issues that are happening to a culture on the individual, you won't be able to guide them properly. And I can't feel safe expressing myself to a therapist if I don't feel like she understands my background and my struggle. I can't trust him with this weight that I'm carrying if I know he can't help me address it.\n\nSo, when it came time for me to look for a therapist for myself and my son, it was like looking for a purple unicorn.\n\nMy foundation, the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation, was born out of that need that I discovered, because I realized there were so many people I can help. The director of the foundation did the research and found the statistics: One in five Americans has mental illness, but African-Americans are the least likely to seek treatment, and have a long history of being misdiagnosed.\n\nIn addition to trying to combat the stigma against mental health care in African-American communities, we have three major goals. One is to get more therapists and mental health programs in urban schools: We need professionals in the school systems to recognize when kids are coming from traumatic experiences and how that impacts their ability to learn.\n\nFor instance, when I was a substitute teacher for children with disabilities, the first time I went to Compton, I pulled up to the school, and the kids were coming up to me, pointing to bullet holes in the school, and saying, \"Ms. Henson, look, it was a shootout last night.\" That's not normal, but they were expected to go to school in that environment like it was nothing, with no counselors, no support.\n\nAnd then, I was put in a class with these young boys, all African-American, who were telling me that they \"can't learn\" because they're special ed. I had been thinking I was there to teach children who had mental and physical disabilities, but those kids could read, and walk, and they had all of their faculties. They'd been classified as \"special ed\" in a school without counselors, in an environment that was clearly traumatic, in a community where there was limited access to mental health services, and told they couldn't achieve academically.\n\nThere's still so many kids like that: They have nowhere to vent, nowhere to talk about these traumatic incidents and we're expecting them to just go to school and learn. We need help in that area.\n\nIn direct response to this, my foundation recently partnered with nonprofit organizations to bring youth mental health first aid training to teachers and staff, as well as workshops in developing trauma-informed curriculum. Our partners offer tools to recognize and address children coming from traumatic situations, as well as what to do to get them some help or some kind of relief.\n\nSecond, we\u2019d like to increase the number of African-American mental health providers by normalizing the conversation around mental health with young people at an earlier age, peeking their interest and making it cool to want to be a psychologist, therapist or counselor. We\u2019re also giving scholarships to students who are interested in pursuing a career in the mental health field.\n\nAnd, finally, to address recidivism in the prison system, we're partnering with organizations who offer programs that help formerly incarcerated people access mental health services and assist in the reintegration process into the community. Many people don't realize how many people in the prison system have undiagnosed or untreated mental health issues, and how that contributes to them winding up back in prison.\n\nThere's a lot to address when you delve into this issues of mental health in the African-American community; there are a lot of things that we must overcome. But at the end of the day, it starts with us at least being able to talk about our mental health issues. And then we can begin to address them.\n\nAs told to THINK editor Megan Carpentier, edited and condensed for clarity."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-photos-ami-s-alleged-extortion-explained-ncna969876", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 10, 2019, 8:20 PM GMT By Glenn Kirschner, former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and NBC/MSNBC legal analyst\n\nJeff Bezos is the richest man in the world. He is also not a man who takes kindly to alleged blackmail attempts. On Thursday, he published a series of emails on Medium that appear to show American Media Inc. (AMI), the parent organization of the National Inquirer tabloid, threatening to publish compromising photos of the CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post unless Bezos dropped an investigation into the tabloid\u2019s coverage of his personal life.\n\nAMI leveled this threat while it was a party to a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors that required AMI to keep its nose clean and \u201ccommit no crimes whatsoever\u201d for three years. All of this has prompted much discussion about whether AMI\u2019s interactions with Bezos qualify as criminal extortion. The answer to the legal question is likely yes.\n\nAMI leveled this threat while it was a party to a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors that required AMI to \u201ccommit no crimes whatsoever.\u201d\n\nYet again, fact appears stranger than fiction in America. To summarize: In January of 2019, the National Enquirer began publishing stories detailing Bezos\u2019 alleged extramarital affair with Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor. The National Enquirer included in its stories private texts between Bezos and Sanchez, prompting Bezos to launch an investigation into how AMI acquired his private correspondence, and whether the National Enquirer\u2019s stories were politically motivated.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nIt appears that upon discovering this investigation, AMI told Bezos \u2014 in writing \u2014 that it would publish compromising, sexually explicit photos of Bezos and Sanchez unless Bezos and the Washington Post stopped investigating the Enquirer\u2019s methods and issue a statement saying that Enquirer coverage of Bezos has not been politically motivated, a statement Bezos maintains is false.\n\nThis sordid and unusual tale is a voyeur\u2019s dream. But it has taken on a new level of public interest due to the fact that AMI, through its CEO David Pecker, is cooperating with federal prosecutors as part of an ongoing investigation into campaign finance violations involving Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIndeed, AMI and David Pecker garnered much attention recently when federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York announced a deal involving information about an alleged campaign finance violation committed in conjunction with Trump fixer Michael Cohen. The prosecutors agreed not to bring charges against AMI in exchange for AMI\u2019s full and truthful cooperation. In that non-prosecution agreement, AMI admitted it paid for and buried a story \u2014 a practice called \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d \u2014 about an alleged affair between Trump and former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal in an effort to keep the information from hurting Trump\u2019s election chances. The federal agreement also stipulated that AMI would not be prosecuted provided the organization committed no new crimes in the three years following the date of the agreement, which was signed on September 20, 2018.\n\nThe question now becomes, did AMI commit a new crime by virtue of the Bezos blackmail scheme. (For its part, AMI has said it does not believe it did anything wrong but is looking into the matter.On Sunday, Elkan Abramowitz, an attorney for AMI CEO David Pecker, told ABC neither extortion nor blackmail was committed.) The stakes are quite high for AMI, as it has already confessed in detail to committing the campaign violation felony. So in the event that AMI is found to have violated the non-pros (non-prosecution) agreement, its earlier confession can be admitted as evidence if the prosecutors chose to charge AMI with extortion. In short, this feels like a case the prosecution can\u2019t lose.\n\nThe stakes are quite high for AMI, as it has already confessed in detail to committing the campaign violation felony.\n\nThe crime of extortion involves threatening to harm a person in order to obtain something of value. In mob parlance, if someone says, \u201cgimme a thousand dollars or I break your thumb,\u201d that constitutes extortion. To be clear, there are more detailed legal requirements, particularly in the federal extortion statutes. However, it\u2019s important to note that in this case, AMI doesn\u2019t need to violate federal laws to break its agreement with SDNY prosecutors \u2014 violating New York State\u2019s laws and criminal statutes would be enough.\n\nThe first element of extortion, threatening to harm another, seems more easily satisfied in this case than the second. Harm need not be of the physical, thumb-breaking sort. Harm to one\u2019s reputation and standing in the community can suffice. It therefore seems clear that AMI threatened to \u201charm\u201d Jeff Bezos\u2019 reputation by publishing compromising, embarrassing and indiscrete material. A more nuanced question is whether AMI was attempting to secure \u201ca thing of value.\u201d AMI clearly was leveling the threat in an attempt to persuade Bezos to stop investigating how AMI came into possession of Bezos\u2019 private messages. AMI also sought to have Bezos issue a statement \u2014 one that Bezos maintains is false \u2014 that the National Inquirer\u2019s original articles about Bezos\u2019 affair were not politically motivated.\n\nAMI is obviously concerned about this information, otherwise it seems unlikely it would take the kind of risk it did. Accordingly, one can reasonably conclude that the there is real value, at least as far as AMI is concerned, in keeping Bezos, the Washington Post and by extension the general public from learning about how AMI acquired Bezos\u2019 materials. Additionally, it\u2019s apparently valuable to AMI that Bezos attempts to clear the company's name publicly. Although it may be impossible to quantify the value of these matters, they clearly qualify as things of value. Hence, prosecutors appear to have enough evidence to work with if they chose to charge AMI with extortion.\n\nIt should be noted that acts of extortion can also serve as the basis of a civil suit. In other words, Bezos could attempt to sue AMI for monetary damages. However, Let\u2019s go out on a limb here and concluded that Bezos probably doesn\u2019t need the money. The real issue is whether the facts as we know them thus far will inspire the SDNY prosecutors to charge AMI with a new crime.\n\nBezos could attempt to sue AMI for monetary damages. However, Let\u2019s go out on a limb here and concluded that Bezos probably doesn\u2019t need the money.\n\nIt may be that federal prosecutors use AMI\u2019s potentially extortionist conduct in a different way. If AMI was charged with extortion, prosecutors ultimately would have to prove its case to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, SDNY prosecutors might instead argue to the court that AMI breached the non-pros agreement and should therefore be prosecuted for the underlying campaign finance felony. This approach would have the fringe benefit of enjoying a much lower burden of proof, given that the question of whether someone violates a cooperation agreement is decided by a judge (not a jury) and generally requires a lower evidentiary standard (i.e., a preponderance of the evidence). Given that SDNY prosecutors probably have all the information they need from AMI and Pecker on the campaign violation front, this approach might prove an easier prosecutorial lift for them.\n\nBut perhaps the bigger question is what exactly is AMI trying to keep secret? It\u2019s possible that AMI engages in this kind of immoral and quite probably illegal behavior more often than we know, as a series of new allegations following the Bezos blog post suggest. But even if this is the case, targeting someone with the resources of Bezos, particularly while contractually obligated to the government to commit no new crimes, seems supremely reckless.\n\nThere has been some speculation that a foreign government may have obtained Bezos\u2019 information and provided it to AMI in an effort to retaliate against the Washington Post for reporting certain stories. Indeed, Bezos himself wrote that \u201cMr. Pecker and his company have also been investigated for various actions they\u2019ve taken on behalf of the Saudi government.\u201d Because the Post has been relentlessly reporting on the suspected involvement of the Saudi government in the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, perhaps the Saudis are working with AMI to embarrass Bezos as a form of payback. (Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has denied any involvement.) Although this theory enjoys a certain international intrigue, there are not nearly enough facts publicly available yet to make any sort of definitive conclusions.\n\nWriting for NBC News, legal analyst Danny Cevallos notes that it will be difficult for AMI to claim this is merely a matter of journalistic inquiry or free speech. AMI is playing with fire, and this time it may well have been burned."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/netflix-s-new-partnership-gwyneth-paltrow-s-goop-brand-win-ncna969746", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 10, 2019, 2:39 PM GMT By Ani Bundel\n\nNetflix is spending the first few months of 2019 continuing its quest to replace TV wholesale by expanding and diversifying its original programming, with an eye toward the 2020 election and beyond. With several competing streaming services launching in the next few years, more production houses are expected to pull their original programming from platforms like Netflix and Hulu.\n\nIn preparation for this, Netflix is attempting to beef up its own archive so the loss of shows like \u201cFriends\u201d and movies like \u201cBlack Panther\u201d don\u2019t cause a notable drop in viewership. But the news that Netflix would be partnering with Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle and \u201cspiritual wellness\u201d brand Goop raised more than a few eyebrows. Netflix has already been called out for leaning into pseudoscience before, but this may be a bridge too far.\n\nNetflix has already been called out for leaning into pseudoscience before, but this may be a bridge too far.\n\nGoop was founded back in 2008. According to the website, it was originally a \u201chomespun\u201d newsletter put together by Paltrow \u201cout of [her] own kitchen,\u201d touting \u201chealth-centric recipes\u201d as part of the star\u2019s transformation from an actress into a lifestyle brand. But even forgiving the faux-humble origin story \u2014 Paltrow was already an Oscar-winning, second-generation Hollywood A-lister who at the time was married to equally famous Coldplay frontman Chris Martin \u2014 Goop has always been a questionable enterprise.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nPaltrow\u2019s website boasts that a week-long detox menu is one of her ten most popular posts ever read, as are stories on \u201cflying better\u201d and makeup products to stock up on the next time you\u2019re in France. Her pop-up store in London sells everything from amethyst bottles (supposedly to give the water one drinks \u201cpositive energy\u201d) to the famous (infamous?) Yoni Jade Egg. In the last couple of years, annual In Goop Health summits have attracted devotees more than happy to shell out $1500 for a ticket. This despite repeated debunkings of her brand\u2019s health claims, and piece after piece arguing the nonsense she sells is nothing more than snake oil.\n\nAnd yet, neither snarky takedowns nor sober scientific analysis has dampened the enthusiasm of Goop\u2019s true believers. Netflix wouldn't be investing in her show (or her alleged quackery) if it didn't think it would sell. And Goop does sell, millions a year. Part of the reason has to do with a health care system that oftentimes treats women's pain as imaginary. Couple this with a society pushing middle and upper-class women \u2014 Goop\u2019s presumed target demographic \u2014 to maintain impossible standards of youth and beauty, and Goop\u2019s business plan makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe 46-year-old Paltrow is perfectly positioned to sell the promise of the unattainable. But Goop doesn\u2019t just promise devotees that they will look 33 forever. With her summits, Paltrow is telling women she cares about them, she hears their complaints about the mainstream system and most importantly, she and her Goop experts are here to help.\n\nThis \u201chelp\u201d is, increasingly, everywhere. Goop has been working hard these last few years to extend its brand across digital platforms. The Netflix partnership is just one part of this plan, which also includes an exclusive podcast partnership with Delta Air Lines, as well as an in-house podcast with beauty expert Jean Godfrey-June, food programming, and a new book club that presumably hopes to one day rival Oprah.\n\nBut just because Netflix can partner with Goop doesn\u2019t mean it should. As chief content officer Elise Loehnen tacitly acknowledged, Netflix is the streaming service with the largest reach. This fact raises a lot of complicated questions about Netflix\u2019s responsibility as an entertainment gatekeeper. Giving this sort of messaging a high-profile platform is dangerous, especially since one assumes the series will be heavily promoted when it eventually launches.\n\nAnd this is also not the first time Netflix has partnered with or promoted docuseries with questionable scientific value. Last year\u2019s \u201cAfflicted\" was called out as harmful by both advocates for the chronically ill, and by some of the participants, who said their health issues were misrepresented. The American Council on Science and Health has warned multiple times that Netflix is a major promoter of junk science programming, going so far as accusing the service of rejecting pro-science documentaries in favor of shows like \u201cGMO OMG,\u201d which promotes anti-GMO hysteria, and \u201cCowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret,\u201d which insists eating of meat is a bigger cause of climate change than fossil fuels.\n\nNetflix would argue it is only going where the money is, just like broadcast TV and cable channels have been doing for decades. But unlike some media companies that clearly segregate serious content from more frivolous or voyeuristic fare, Netflix does not at the moment discriminate. All of its programming is jumbled together.\n\nPerhaps this will keep Netflix honest. The streaming service\u2019s rapid growth may be partly to keep ahead of the great content cataclysm soon to come. But in its headlong rush to replace programming, Netflix is undermining and diluting its original branding tag.\n\nWith Goop, Netflix is willingly getting into bed with one of its most high-profile pseudoscience series to date. Will this upset its subscriber base? Maybe not immediately. But Netflix would be wise to learn from the mistakes made by Facebook, which refused to pay attention to criticism of its content until it literally became the subject of a congressional inquiry.\n\nBecause Jade eggs may seem silly and harmless on the surface. But buying into entertainment programming masquerading as scientific fact when real health problems come calling can have serious consequences. Netflix may be doing its own version of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things\u201d in the entertainment industry, but there\u2019s enough disinformation being released online in the pursuit of eyeballs and page views. It\u2019s already effected the health of our political system. We shouldn\u2019t allow the same disease to affect the health of our bodies, too."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/msnbc-hosts-state-union-address-jeff-bezos-reported-trump-tirade-ncna969701", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 9, 2019, 9:46 PM GMT\n\nDid you see what Joe & Chris, Ari, Rachel, Nicolle and Lawrence had to say on MSNBC?

Which means we\u2019ll have Robert Mueller with us, in one form or another, for a long while. Which, in turn, means we\u2019ll have Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE\n\nIf that prospect sounds dispiriting, please muster up some understanding. In fact, let\u2019s observe a moment of silence for poor Giuliani \u2014 and for the 17 other lawyers the White House recently hired to defend Trump against the coming onslaught by the special counsel and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nLet\u2019s observe a moment of silence for poor Giuliani \u2014 and for the 17 other lawyers the White House reportedly recently hired to defend Trump against the coming onslaught.\n\nTrue, some people will find these attorneys hard to feel sorry for. But they are going to run into many, many troubles, general and specific. Because here\u2019s the problem with being a defense lawyer: It\u2019s hard \u2014 not impossible, but hard \u2014 to be better than your client.\n\nIn extreme cases, all kinds of clients can ask lawyers to do illegal things \u2014 which, if the lawyers are at all sane, they won\u2019t. Clients can also plan to perjure themselves and ask their lawyers to help them do it. Which the lawyers won\u2019t if they are even minimally self-protective.\n\nMore commonly, clients will supply their lawyers with accounts of what the clients did and did not do in the case at hand \u2014 and the lawyers will know or suspect that the clients aren\u2019t telling the truth.\n\nWhy? A defendant may think he or she is smarter than the lawyer and can pull the wool over the lawyer\u2019s eyes. Or, said defendant may be madly, truly, deeply in denial. Or, a defendant may be under instructions from someone else or may be just plain afraid.\n\nTo get a reasonably accurate story out of a client like this, a lawyer may use a variety of tools \u2014 blandishments, guile, invocations of authority, appeals to the fear of God. Whatever works. In one case I know, a lawyer had a client who was working for a foreign government. The client had no intention of spilling the beans to anyone \u2014 including his lawyer \u2014 though keeping quiet was going to mean even deeper trouble. In fact, he was avoiding situations in which he\u2019d be totally alone with the lawyer.\n\nSo, the lawyer set up what he billed as a purely family dinner, with the client and his sister. But the sister loved her brother and understood that the lawyer had to be fully armed. The dinner conversation was, in fact, social. Midway through the meal, however, the sister got up with a smile and said to the lawyer, \u201cHe\u2019s all yours.\u201d Then she walked out of the restaurant. The lawyer and the client were left sitting at the table alone.\n\nThe lawyer then started work, attacking the account that his client had given him and everyone else. Ultimately, the lawyer (who was good at what he did) managed to piece together what was, more or less, the truth. The exercise was unpleasant \u2014 and the true story, once known, caused an international incident. But it was necessary. If you don\u2019t know the actual facts, you can\u2019t prepare for the attacks on the story that are bound to come.\n\nThis is true in general. It is especially true if the client is a political figure. Because politicians have their own expertise in manipulating public communications, they are likely to think that they are much better at the game than their legal mouthpieces.\n\nIt is even more true if the client is a U.S. president. A president is usually surrounded by jealous aides trying to undermine the lawyer\u2019s authority. Other official trappings persuade the chief executive of both his communications genius and his imperviousness to ordinary legal jeopardy.\n\nIt is most true of all when a presidential defendant is a person whose sense of what did or did not happen is determined by what benefits him at any given moment.\n\nIt is most true of all when a presidential defendant is a person whose sense of what did or did not happen is determined by what benefits him at any given moment.\n\nDuring Watergate, President Richard M. Nixon gave his attorneys more than their share of legal heartburn by treating the crisis as a political matter in which the lawyers couldn\u2019t play a critical role. He not only excluded them from key strategic decisions, he deprived them of knowledge of primary facts \u2014 like the existence of the Oval Office taping system.\n\nStill, Nixon was himself an experienced lawyer who, in the end, had a clear view of legal realities. When the courts told him that his tapes were not protected by executive privilege, he knew that the rules required him to comply.\n\nDecades later, President Bill Clinton became embroiled in the Paula Jones case. He faced the prospect of not only testifying, but having his blood drawn as evidence. Clinton tried to get himself the best arrangements possible for doing these things, but there\u2019s no record of his having tried to kick over the table completely. He knew the rules and complied.\n\nThis time, in contrast, we have a president whose reactions to such rules are massively unknown and unknowable, with a record that includes attacks on the U.S. judiciary. His lawyers may have to exert executive privilege in the face of legal problems that Nixon\u2019s lawyers could not have imagined.\n\nSo, when you watch Giuliani\u2019s circumlocutions and seeming confusion, be charitable. People have taken to saying that his legal skills are rusty. Some of them clearly are. But other litigators\u2019 instincts don\u2019t fade. Among them is the instinct for triangulation: Knowing where the inconsistencies and intransigence are and talking in a way that seeks to avoid them or make them plausible.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of what we see Giuliani doing: trying to follow and justify presidential statements and positions that make no legal \u2014 or even factual \u2014 sense.\n\nWe have very little idea of how much Giuliani knows about what Trump knows. All we know is what it means that Giuliani signed up to work for Trump and hasn\u2019t yet quit.\n\nLet\u2019s see how the new White House lawyers hold up to the same punishment."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cockroaches-are-better-any-your-exes-so-why-let-zoo-ncna969476", "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nFeb. 9, 2019, 9:32 AM GMT By Catherine Bartlett, education specialist, Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum\n\nIs your ex, like, totally gross? Did they fail to do anything around the house, whether cleaning up or feeding the kids, and mixed the recycling with the trash? Did you find their sluggishness tiresome, their personal hygiene questionable? Or, worse, was that person was far from monogamous, or leave you with a disease?\n\nIn an effort to help animal lovers exact a modicum of revenge from their terrible exes during a season that celebrates couplehood, a number of zoos are playing into an existing stereotype about the animal kingdom. The Hemsley Conservation Centre outside of London, for a mere \u00a31.50, will let people name the institution's roaches after their exes for Valentine's Day. The Bronx Zoo in New York is offering naming rights for $15 in a holiday-themed promotion. And the El Paso Zoo in Texas is not only offering Facebook fans the chance to name cockroaches after their exes, they're going to feed those exes to the zoo's meerkats live on camera.\n\nHowever, this is totally unfair... to cockroaches. They are almost assuredly better than your worst exes.\n\nAn American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), on which a radio tag is attached, is seen at the Universite libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels March 6, 2015. Yves Herman / Reuters file\n\nTrue, cockroaches give many the heebie-jeebies (though your friends might say the same about your ex); it could be their flattened, oval bodies, their long antennae or that they tend to be be fast movers. They are also, rightly or wrongly, associated with debris and decay \u2014 but, of the over 4,000 described species of cockroaches, only a very few are considered pests and none are known to be vectors of human disease.\n\nActually, cockroaches, like vultures and worms, are part of nature\u2019s clean up crew, helping rid the world of decomposing and decaying matter. They are generalist feeders and snack on foul food: Rotten wood, fungi, guano and dung get eaten by ravenous roaches. And, if they\u2019re doing it, we don\u2019t have to deal with it. Gross? Perhaps, but so is taking out the trash or changing poopy diapers. Necessary? Absolutely \u2014 and they do it without having to be nagged.\n\nNature\u2019s original recyclers may also be cockroaches. In helping break down organic waste since the Jurassic period, their own waste, rich in nitrogen, has been nourishing growing plants just as long.\n\nCockroaches are also more useful than a lot of exes: As easy pickings, they are readily available snacks for a variety of other animals. Birds, lizards, other invertebrates and some mammals (like the aforementioned meerkats) often dine on crunchy cockroaches, thereby ingesting necessary proteins and fats. After all, who doesn\u2019t love chowing down on some wings?\n\nCockroaches are quite useful for humans, too, and have been utilized in experimental research. Like white rats, Manduca (caterpillars), and Drosophila (fruit flies), they are so-called \"model\" organisms that have helped researchers investigate everything from medicine, antibacterial resistance and bioengineering. Their size and behavior has even \u201cprovided inspiration for soft, legged search and rescue robots that may penetrate rubble.\u201d\n\nAnd due to their size and ease of care \u2014 unlike many exes \u2014 they are frequently used in the educational arena. School children everywhere have been delighted when a Madagascar hissing cockroach forces air out its spiracles or observed the beauty of a green banana roach. (The same can not often be said for an ex.)\n\nOne roach, a wood roach, even exhibits extended parental care. A monogamous pair of wood roaches will live together in rotting logs for years, eating wood and raising their young together. However, since cellulose is so difficult to process, they (like termites) have gut symbionts to break it down for them. Those symbionts get passed down to their young through protodeal trophallaxis \u2014 that is, the nymphs feed on excreted liquids from an adult\u2019s anus for up to a year. It\u2019s not unlike the process in which a mammalian baby establishes a healthy gut microbiome from breastfeeding, and arguably as adorable.\n\nAn American cockroach is trapped on a sticky card after escaping from the race tracks during the Great Cockroach Derby in Singapore on August 10, 2006. Kimitsu Yogachi / Reuters file\n\nBeing named after an insect is, when it comes to other species, a badge of honor. Many a celebrity has been bestowed with an arthropod accolade. Gary Larson of \"The Far Side\u201d fame has an owl louse named after him, Lady Gaga got a wasp and Leonardo DiCaprio and Stephen Colbert each got a beetle. Even the Queen Bey herself, Beyonc\u00e9, has a horse fly named after her; Scaptia beyonceae happens to have an impressively large golden-haired booty.\n\nCockroaches are clean, devoted to their young and beautiful. So, if an insect is named after you, take it as a point of pride this Valentine\u2019s Day. These animals aren\u2019t bad; they just got a bad rap (possibly like you have).

(Or in this case, the brick-busters.) After the remarkable success of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d last year during what used to be considered the desolate wastelands of February releases, this month sees multiple franchise releases, none of which are Valentine\u2019s Day oriented. Some viewers will, of course, opt for the wannabe romantic comedy \u201cWhat Men Want.\u201d But Warner Brothers is betting audiences would rather see family friendly fare constructed out of Denmark\u2019s finest molded plastic pieces.\n\nThe original \u201cThe Lego Movie,\u201d released in the doldrums of February 2014, was both a surprise box-office hit (bringing in around $258 million domestically) and a critical darling. The film looked similar to other films created as much to sell merchandise as tickets and popcorn; \u201cTransformers\u201d and \u201cTrolls\u201d come to mind. But beneath the film\u2019s standard action hero narrative a surprising tootsie roll of a film revealed a gooey, twisty center. As audiences eventually learned, the whole story was an allegory for what was happening in the real world, with a human boy named Finn playing on his father\u2019s meticulously constructed Lego sets. The film asked viewers to remember that toys are toys, and that adults who try to stifle a child\u2019s creativity \u2014 by refusing allow any deviations from Lego set instructions, for example \u2014 risked creating a joyless world.\n\nBeneath the film\u2019s standard action hero narrative a surprising tootsie roll of a film revealed a gooey, twisty center.\n\nThe first film ended with the human father (Will Ferrell, who also played the Lego world\u2019s evil president) forcing Finn to allow his younger sister Bianca to play with the toys, too. In the Lego world, this news translated into an invasion of Duplo monsters. This was both a metaphor for Finn\u2019s new sibling rival, as well as an actual representation of his sister's collection of oversized Duplos. The arrival of the large-bricked creatures promised a new battle lay ahead. And the sequel picks up at exactly this moment, as Emmet (Chris Pratt), the big-hearted, optimistic hero of the tale, tries and fails to make peace with the Duplo invaders.\n\nCut to five years later, and Finn (still played by the original film's Jadon Sand), is now a teenager lording over his newest creation, Apocalypseburg. This Lego world is colorless and sparkle free, both a testament to Finn\u2019s teen angst and a way to keep sister Bianca (Brooklynn Prince) and her own girly Lego hordes from attempting to join. The sequel no longer has the benefit of acting as a secret allegory for a real-world tale, meaning creators Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are also less subtle about their familial parallels.\n\nThe Duplos are from the Systar System, ruled by Tiffany Haddish\u2019s Queen Watevra Wa\u2019nabi. (Say it out loud, you\u2019ll figure it out.) Emmet is left to save the day when the queen kidnaps his friends, including Lucy (Elizabeth Banks) and Batman (Will Arnett), to participate in her Matrimonial Scheme \u2014 which may or may not be a secretly evil plan to bring about OurMommageddeon. (Just goes with us on this.) Emmet finds help in a rugged and macho adventurer named Rex Dangervest, who quickly becomes his mentor. Dangervest is also voiced by Pratt, and in a not-at-all subtle reference runs a spaceship with a crew of \u201cJurassic Park\u201d Lego dinosaurs. (None of the Legos from Pratt\u2019s other hit movie show up, but this is explained away with the declaration that Marvel is not returning the sequel's calls.)\n\n\u201cThe Lego Movie 2\u201d is less innovative than the original, but delight is still found in the details. And Finn\u2019s teenager status gives the writers license to incorporate a whole host of new pop culture references. From \u201cDie Hard\u201d to \u201cTwilight,\u201d the film is stuffed with inside jokes about everything from Warner Brother\u2019s Justice League franchise to Jason Momoa\u2019s mini Aquaman. (Don\u2019t worry, Classic Aquaman is also still hanging around, too.) There\u2019s even time travel, and I am happy to report, a Lego TARDIS. Like with the first film, the script's jokes unfurl in quick succession. In a movie aimed at all ages and genders, this mile-a-minute humor is pretty effective.\n\nSpeaking of genders, if the first \u201cLego Movie\u201d was a bit of a boy\u2019s film, \u201cThe Lego Movie 2\u201d works hard to course correct. Dad is basically absent, which means the audience finally gets to meet Mom (Maya Rudolph). And in fact, the mostly female toys in the Systar System \u2014 an entire band of Wonder Women among them \u2014 are a whole lot more fun than their rivals in Apocalypseburg. (They also have much better style. Batman\u2019s Man of Bats makeover is particularly excellent.) Emmet worries the queen is brainwashing his friends, but really given the choice between a world of gritty reboot references and an avante-garde, sticker-covered spa day, the \u201cgirly\u201d world looks pretty good.\n\nAnd did I mention this sequel is a musical? The original film\u2019s catchy \u201cEverything Is Awesome\u201d makes an appearance or two and songwriters have added a new earworm, literally entitled \u201cCatchy Song.\u201d Sung by Dillon Francis and featuring both T-Pain and That Girl Lay Lay, the repeating chorus of \u201cthis song\u2019s gonna get stuck inside your head\u201d is deservedly confident. Good luck not humming along.\n\nBut for all its pop-culture allusions and commercial references, \u201cThe Lego Movie 2\u201d is still, deep down, a story about the importance of creativity in play \u2014 and being nice to your siblings. In between Emmet\u2019s story of saving his friends, there\u2019s also a poignant lesson about the importance of not growing up too fast, as well as many not-so-subtle digs at the terrible toxic masculinity messages pretty much every teenage boy finds himself confronted with at some point.\n\nA movie about toys that reminds men it\u2019s ok to be kind and gentle? Now that\u2019s a message worthy of some playful brainwashing."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/smollett-hate-crime-was-exposed-fraud-old-fashioned-police-work-n974071", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But because Monday was a holiday, it wasn\u2019t until Tuesday the two brothers appeared before a grand jury.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that this was staged and Jussie hired these two guys to stage them for his benefit... put them in a really tough spot as well,\u201d Johnson said, adding that they have the check for $3,500 that Smollett had given them. \u201cThey were arrested for a hate crime. \u2026 We were able to get the truth from them.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, at 5 a.m., Smollett surrendered to police.\n\n\u201cIt was uneventful,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt went smoothly.\u201d\n\nJohnson credited \u201cold-fashioned police work\u201d with cracking the case. He bristled when asked if this case was treated differently because Smollett is a celebrity and told the assembled reporters they fanned this into a national story.\n\n\u201cYou guys did,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pull any resources from any shooting or homicide investigations.

This is not baseball, you don\u2019t get a third chance,\" she told Stone.\n\nStone can still raise funds for his legal defense and maintain his innocence publicly, but he cannot comment on the case or its participants, the judge said.\n\nBefore issuing her ruling, Jackson said Stone \"couldn't keep his story straight on the stand\" when she allowed him the opportunity to explain his decision to post an image of her on Instagram with what appeared to be the crosshairs of a gun near her head. His apology, she said, rang \"hollow.\"\n\nThe Instagram post in question, posted to Stone's account earlier this week, was accompanied by a caption in which he suggested Jackson was politically biased, slammed Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe and sought donations for his legal defense. Stone later said his post wasn't meant to be threatening and deleted it.\n\n\"I am hurtfully sorry for my own stupidity. I am kicking myself, not as much as my wife is kicking me,\" Stone told the court Thursday. He called the Instagram post \"a momentary lapse of judgment\" before saying that the photo was selected by someone who works for him, which he estimated was about \"five or six people.\"\n\nStone also said he \"didn't think they were crosshairs.\"\n\nJackson, who is presiding over his prosecution, responded to Stone's Instagram post by scheduling the hearing to discuss \"why the media contact order entered in this case and/or his conditions of release should not be modified or revoked in light of the posts on his Instagram account.\"\n\nHer options included revoking his bail.\n\nStone's attorneys argued Thursday that Stone, who said he was broke and struggling to deal with the stress, did not violate the limited gag order or the conditions of his release. They assured Jackson that Stone would not repeat his mistake.\n\n\"Sometimes a person learns a lesson, especially when a person is unrestrained in his speaking. It\u2019s indefensible,\" Stone attorney Bruce Rogow said.\n\n\"I agree with you there,\" the judge said.\n\nGovernment prosecutors sought a stricter gag order.\n\n\"I would submit that the defendant's testimony at this hearing was not credible,\" prosecutor Jonathan Kravis said. \"That he committed a lapse in judgement is belied by the fact that even after he realized the post was a mistake, he continued to make statements to the media that amplified that message.\"\n\nStone, who was arrested by the FBI in January, faces seven charges arising from Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, including five counts of making false statements, one count of obstruction and one count of witness tampering. Stone has denied all charges.\n\nAfter Stone gave a slew of media interviews, Jackson issued a limited gag order in the case last week that prevents Stone from speaking to the press about the case in the vicinity of the courthouse.\n\nNeither the limited gag order, nor the threat of jail time, discouraged Stone from giving interviews or posting about his case.\n\nOn his way to court Thursday morning, he was on Instagram again, posting a photo of him posing with merchandise he's selling in support of his legal defense.\n\n\u201cHelp me in my epic fight against the anti-@realdonaldTrump Deep State,\u201d he wrote with the hashtag, #rogerstonedidnothingwrong."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/world-s-largest-bee-once-feared-extinct-rediscovered-indonesia-n974291", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The group, which supported the effort, runs a lost species program.\n\n\"The structure was just too perfect and similar to what we expected to find,\" Bolt wrote. \"I climbed up next, and my headlamp glinted on the most remarkable thing I'd ever laid my eyes on.

The bee was found on the last day of a five-day stop in the area, the University of Sydney said.\n\n\"Messer's rediscovery gave us some insight, but we still know next to nothing about this extraordinary insect,\" Wyman said in the University of Sydney statement. \"I hope this rediscovery will spark research that will give us a deeper understanding of this unique bee and inform any future efforts to protect it from extinction.\"\n\nThe size of the huge bee dwarfs that of a honeybee.\n\n\"It was absolutely breathtaking to see this 'flying bulldog' of an insect that we weren\u2019t sure existed anymore,\" Bolt said in a statement released by the university. Bolt took the first photos and video of the bee after the discovery, the university said.\n\nThe discovery raises hopes that more could be found in Indonesia's forests, according to the University of Sydney.\n\nLynn S. Kimsey, professor of entomology and the director of the Bohart Museum of Entomology at the University of California, Davis, said that the discovery is significant, but that there are many insect species that have not been collected in a long period of time.

Eliot Engel, Adam Smith and Adam Schiff, chairmen of the House foreign affairs, intelligence and armed services committees, wrote in a letter to the president.\n\nThe lawmakers said \"our ability to conduct oversight of U.S. policy toward North Korea on behalf of the American people has been inappropriately curtailed by your administration's unwillingness to share information with Congress.\"\n\nTrump plans to head to the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi next week for a second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But the Democratic lawmakers said Congress has yet to have been briefed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on what transpired at the last summit between the two heads of state in Singapore in June last year.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate have been frustrated for some time over the frequency of briefings from the administration, a staffer told NBC News.\n\nBut the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, disagreed.\n\nThe senator \"communicates with the State Department, the National Security Council, and the White House regularly on this issue, even as recently as this week,\" spokesperson Kaylin Minton said in an email. \"So needless to say, he has a different view.\"\n\nThe White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn their letter to the president, the Democrats cited recent comments from top intelligence officials and military leaders that North Korea was unlikely to completely abandon its nuclear weapons arsenal, saying it contradicted the president's portrayal of the negotiations.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-Un inspecting a launching drill of the medium-and-long range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12.

The Democrats said Congress has been cut off from intelligence on those programs and that it had undercut lawmakers' ability to assess the threat posed by the regime.\n\nThe Democratic chairs also said the administration has failed to abide by the defense authorization law that required the secretary of defense to deliver a report to Congress by October 2018 on North Korea's nuclear program, which was supposed to serve as a baseline for progress in any talks with Pyongyang. But the administration has still not delivered the report.\n\nAt the summit in Hanoi, Trump will try to persuade North Korea to agree to concrete steps to abandon its nuclear weapons program, but the two sides have so far failed to agree on a definition of what denuclearization should entail.\n\n\"I don't know if North Korea has made the choice yet to denuclearize, but the reason why we're engaged in this is because we believe there's a possibility that North Korea can make the choice to fully denuclearize,\" a senior administration official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"And that's why the President has assigned such a priority to engaging with them.\"\n\nTrump has said that North Korea's decision not to carry out missile and nuclear testing in recent months \u2014 and his rapport with Kim \u2014 offers proof that his approach is making diplomatic progress.\n\nNorth Korea, meanwhile, is pushing for lifting international economic sanctions, which it blames in part for contributing to food shortages in the isolated state. North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Song, appealed for food aid in a recent memo to the UN obtained by NBC News.

On Election Day Harris had narrowly topped Democrat Dan McCready in unofficial results.\n\n\"Through the testimony I listened to over the past three days, I believe a new election should be called. It's become clear to me that the public's confidence in the ninth district seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted,\" Harris said.\n\nIt was a dramatic turn for Harris who had been aggressively defending himself throughout the months-long investigation and the four-day hearing, insisting that he had no knowledge of fraudulent activity involving absentee ballots in two rural counties in the ninth district.\n\nHarris made his declaration one day after his son, John Harris, testified that he warned his father of the possible illegal tactics political operative McCrae Dowless used in an absentee ballot operation. Harris hired him anyway, saying on the stand that it was his son's \"opinion\" about Dowless but that he was assured that Dowless worked within the confines of the law. He insisted that he that he had no knowledge of alleged illegal activities regarding mail-in ballots.\n\nBut Harris was at risk of perjuring himself during his testimony over a discussion he had with his son about emails being used as evidence. He said from the witness stand that he did not discuss the emails with anyone ahead of the hearing. After he said that, his attorney, David Friedman, immediately asked to speak to his client behind closed doors. The board agreed, called for a lunch break and then went into closed session. When they returned, Harris corrected the record.\n\n\"Obviously, I was incorrect in my recollection, and I wholeheartedly apologize to this board,\" Harris, a Baptist preacher, said.\n\nIt was at that point he called for a new election, citing health problems and his opinion that the public has lost faith in the election.\n\nThe state board agreed. Chairman Bob Cordle said that based on evidence presented this week about \"the corruption, the absolute mess with the absentee ballots, the illegal activities that have occurred there in the election office itself, and with the people involved in the absentee ballots,\" it \"certainly was a tainted election.\"\n\nThroughout the week, state investigators described a \"coordinated, unlawful\" mail-in ballot \"scheme\" in Bladen County run by operative Dowless that included the collection of absentee ballots, which is illegal in North Carolina.\n\nHarris testified Thursday that Dowless had repeatedly assured him that he would not be doing anything against the law in his absentee ballot operation. Harris said that after consideration and talking with others he trusted, he decided to move forward with hiring Dowless.\n\nJohn Harris, an assistant U.S. attorney in North Carolina, testified Wednesday that he told his father he had become concerned about Dowless after studying the 2016 congressional primary in the same 9th District. He testified that his father decided to hire Dowless despite his concerns.\n\n\"I can tell you that my view is that they heard my concerns,\" John Harris said.\n\nOn Thursday, Mark Harris said he read his son's advice as \"a warning. He added that he \"was proud of his son and \"I love him with all my heart,\" but added that his son was young and \"judgmental\" and possessed a \"taste of arrogance.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/i-don-t-know-trump-draws-blank-homosexuality-decriminalization-push-n974161", "text": "Feb. 21, 2019, 9:17 PM GMT By Tim Fitzsimons\n\nA day after the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration revealed his push to decriminalize homosexuality around the world, the president was caught on camera seemingly unaware of the effort.\n\nRichard Grenell, in Meseberg, Germany on July 6, 2018.

Hardesty, who said she's unable to attend Thursday's meeting, is not personally associated with the petition, but is herself wary about allowing the police to investigate itself.\n\n\"Anytime there's pushback to the Portland police, the knee-jerk response is we'll do an investigation,\" she said. \"But we're still waiting on an investigation from last August, when we had a community member who almost lost their life because police\" used a flash bang grenade.\n\nWheeler called the texts \"disturbing\" after a report in the Willamette Week on Feb. 14 highlighting the correspondence between Joey Gibson, the leader of Patriot Prayer, and Portland police Lt. Jeff Niiya, the commander of the department's rapid response team.\n\nBut The Oregonian reported Wednesday that Niiya was communicating with one of Wheeler's senior policy advisers in order to help City Hall keep tabs on Gibson \u2014 calling into question how much the mayor also knew about Niiya's and Gibson's relationship.\n\nAccording to text messages, Niiya and Gibson shared messages in 2017 and 2018 that were joking at times, but also raise concerns that police gave Patriot Prayer and its members preferential treatment, even though they had been involved in bloody brawls with antifascist protesters.\n\nIn one text exchange, Niiya told Gibson that officers ignored a warrant on a disorderly conduct charge for one of his members at a previous demonstration, and warned him that \"I don't see a need to arrest on the warrant unless there is a reason.\"\n\nIn another exchange, Gibson told Niiya he was planning to run for elected office. Niiya responded, \"Your [sic] running for office?!! Good for you.

Its rallies, however, have drawn interest from white supremacists and white nationalists, and members have been aligned with other extremist groups who have used racist and Islamophobic language.\n\nGibson said in a statement that his conversations with Niiya were part of the police bureau's efforts to de-escalate at public demonstrations. \"A police officer on the task force and I exchanged text messages for that purpose,\" he added.\n\nJoey Gibson speaks during a rally in Berkeley, California on April 27, 2017.

It did fall in the Santa Monica Mountains above Malibu, Stewart said, and reports of snow in nearby communities such as Westlake Village, Thousand Oaks and Calabasas were likely true.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Twitter account responded to one video post claiming snow in Thousand Oaks: \"Correct, that is snow!

He said it was the first time he didn\u2019t starve himself \u201cfor weeks\u201d before a photo shoot, even a fully clothed one.\n\nThe body-positive message drew widespread praise, but the platform for the message, Instagram, struck some gay men as ironic.\n\nInstagram, which boasts roughly a billion users, is arguably the most visual social media platform, as its content is comprised of mostly photos and videos, with some memes sprinkled in. But for some users \u2014 particularly gay men, who have long dealt with social pressure to have a body that fits the \"masculine ideal\" \u2014 the image-centric platform has morphed from being a social network for friends to a sea of semi-nude \u201cinfluencer\u201d accounts.\n\nThese accounts, often dubbed \u201cthirst traps,\u201d typically feature scantily clad men with chiseled physiques hanging out on the beach or gay hot spots. They can have anywhere from 10,000 to a million followers, and they often post sponsored content where brands can promote their products. But this \u201ceye candy\u201d can have a negative consequence for some men who follow these accounts.\n\nPatrick Lehe, 29, has struggled with his weight, including periods of binging and crash dieting. He said Instagram often reinforces the stereotype that gay culture is only for \u201cripped, statuesque men.\u201d\n\nAt 6 feet tall, his weight has fluctuated between 188 and 277 pounds. He came out as gay after moving to Los Angeles, but he said because of his heavier weight, he feels even less accepted now than he did in the small town in Indiana in which he grew up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at a healthier weight now, but it\u2019s not one that is accepted by most in the community,\u201d Lehe told NBC News. \u201cInstagram helps create this idea that gay life is only for the \u2018six-pack pals.\u2019 I\u2019ve felt this insecurity I couldn\u2019t shake unless I fit the fa\u00e7ade of beauty.\u201d\n\nPatrick Lehe, 29, says that Instagram often reinforces the stereotype that gay culture is only for \"ripped, statuesque men.\" Courtesy of Patrick Lehe\n\nApproximately 20 million women and 10 million men in the United States will have an eating disorder at some point in their lives, according to the National Eating Disorder Association. The organization found gay men struggle disproportionately with body image issues and eating disorders: Though they are thought to make up only 5 percent of the national male population, gay men account for 42 percent of men who report having an eating disorder.\n\nAsher Pandjiris is a therapist in New York City who treats LGBTQ people with eating disorders and was also a program director at an eating disorder center. She said high rates of disordered eating in the LGBTQ community are often reactions to the homophobia internalized in youth.\n\n\u201cQueer people often try and prove heteronormativity by having a muscled or thin body,\u201d Pandjiris said. \u201cBut it\u2019s almost more insidious that the queer community polices or generates these unattainable standards.\u201d\n\nPandjiris said it\u2019s common to see patients engage in disordered eating, such as starving themselves if they miss a workout or before trips to gay events where their bodies are on display. She said looking at statuesque bodies on social media can play a hidden role in the problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for patients sometimes to connect the dots \u2014 that they saw a post on social media that makes them feel like they have to look a certain way in gay spaces, that they need to work out obsessively and starve themselves before a trip to Fire Island,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd research has indeed shown that high frequency of social media usage \u2014 particularly image-centric platforms like Instagram \u2014 corresponds to body image concerns and eating disorder symptoms in gay men.\n\nSome of the ripped men on Instagram took note of Smith\u2019s post. Max Emerson, whose page has more than a million followers, mostly posts photos of himself in his underwear, either alone or with other men with a similar physique.\n\nEmerson, 30, said he\u2019d like to feature more diversity on his page, but he said the reality is that posts with diverse bodies don\u2019t get as much engagement.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not selling a fantasy at first, you\u2019re not going to get the platform,\u201d he said. He pointed out that sponsors often cast his posts and that people with diverse bodies may not want to appear in photos with him, and that by keeping the platform popular, he's been able to raise significant funds for LGBTQ causes.\n\n\u201cStill, what Sam did is important,\u201d he said. \u201cI could do more.\u201d\n\nLehe still follows a few \u201cthirst traps,\u201d but some gay men decide to cut them out altogether.\n\nPatrick McNaughton, 35, said he unfollowed all such accounts about six months ago. When he joined Instagram in its nascent days in 2011, he enjoyed it as a way to keep up with friends.\n\n\u201cEventually, it changed. It became hundreds, if not thousands of these hot guys posting pics,\u201d he said.\n\nMcNaughton struggled with anorexia as a teenager and unhealthy diet and exercise later in life. He said that the photos of perfectly chiseled men on Instagram was an unwelcome reminder that in gay culture, it\u2019s hard to get even platonic attention without that kind of a body.\n\n\u201cThe photos are saying, \u2018Look we\u2019re all gorgeous, and we all hang out with people who look like us,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf I saw those guys all together, they\u2019d obviously never talk to me. So why maintain the fantasy by looking at the pictures?\u201d\n\nThe way the men post about mundane aspects of their life \u2014 getting coffee, going to the gym, lying in bed reading \u2014 gives the false sense of real connection with them, according to McNaughton. \u201cIt\u2019s like they are letting you into the elite social circle of hot guys,\u201d he said.\n\nBrogan, who has almost 50,000 followers and asked to be identified only by his Instagram handle to maintain a professional separation from his work at a startup, said he does feel connected to his followers. He said most messages he gets cite his feed as motivating, and he views Instagram as personally liberating.\n\nFor three years as a teenager, Brogan underwent conversion therapy in Virginia where he was told he was too feminine. He said this caused him to exercise obsessively in an effort to attain a physique perceived as masculine. \u201cI looked great, but I was depressed,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, he\u2019s found a balance in his diet and exercise, and is comfortable with his body. \u201cI feel good when I\u2019m walking around in my underwear,\u201d he said. \u201cI view the photos as art.\u201d\n\nWhen Brogan, 30, saw Smith\u2019s post, he said he was surprised because he thought Smith looked great.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d proudly stand next to him in photos. I don\u2019t see our bodies as being in different categories,\u201d he said. But he acknowledged that his feed doesn\u2019t feature any men with physiques similar to Smith\u2019s. The only posts showing diversity are a few with his friend, Mila Jam, a trans woman of color with an athletic physique and almost 20,000 followers.\n\n\u201cDo my photos with her make my engagements plummet? Yes. She\u2019s a woman. My followers want a sexy man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I thought it was important to feature her.\u201d\n\nPadjiris, the therapist, said most people suffer in silence, creating the impression that this isn\u2019t a widespread problem. She said it\u2019s important for those with a platform to speak out, but ultimately the whole community could deal more honestly with the pressure on queer bodies.\n\n\u201cSmith said in his post it took courage to speak up. We could decide that we have a different standard of beauty, that we don\u2019t have to conform to the heteronormative image,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be brave.\u201d\n\nIf you struggle with disordered eating or someone you love does, contact the National Eating Disorders Association (U.S.) helpline at (800) 931-2237.\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK & INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/peter-tork-monkees-dies-77-n974096", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Aisha Jackson, who is also black, is performing as Princess Anna.\n\n\u201cWe just knew we wanted a very diverse company for the first production and will continue that with all subsequent productions,\u201d Michael Grandage, the musical's director, said. \u201cThe only thing that is set is we know that we want the companies of Frozen to always be diverse and represent the world we live in.\u201d\n\nYes, in the 2013 Oscar-winning animated film \u201cFrozen,\u201d all of the lead characters are white. In the show\u2019s debut, Patti Murin, who is white, was cast to play Anna on stage. Just weeks after the Broadway debut of \u201cFrozen,\u201d Jackson stepped in to the lead role for a few shows in late March 2018 and has performed several times since then.\n\nBut Jackson tells NBCBLK that not everyone was excited to see a black woman play Princess Anna.\n\n\u201cWe got some celebratory messages,\u201d Jackson, who is Murin's understudy in the role of Anna, said in an interview. \u201cBut we also got some looks, and people would say \u2018they are going to be confused when a black Anna comes out on stage.\u2019\u201d\n\nJackson tried her best to stay focused, but said she could feel the glares. However, Ricketts sings her praises.\n\n\u201cAisha is an incredible actress, and she takes you on a journey that makes it so believable and so real that you can\u2019t help but be changed by the end,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAt the end of the show, it\u2019s either your choice to change or not.\u201d\n\nMusicals such as \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d have provided opportunities for African-American performers on Broadway.\n\nIn recent years, several Broadway productions have cast black actors in traditionally white roles. In 2018, \u201cKing Kong\u201d cast Christiani Pitts, the first woman of color to portray Ann Darrow, a role that historically was portrayed by a white woman.\n\nDiversity has increased in recent years on Broadway \u2014 often called the Great White Way \u2014 The New York Times reported in 2018. A study by the Asian American Performers Action Coalition found \u201cthe 2015-16 season to be the most diverse the group has reviewed so far, with 35 percent of all roles going to minority actors.\u201d\n\nMany performers and producers are hoping to expand the opportunities for black people on Broadway.\n\nStephen Byrd says he and his partner, Alia Jones-Harvey, are two of the few black producers on Broadway. The duo, who worked on \u201cAmerican Son\u201d starring Kerry Washington, hopes to diversify the industry with their organization, Front Row Productions. Now, their company is working on \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud,\u201d a musical about Motown Records group The Temptations and its journey from the streets of Detroit to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nFor several years, \u201cThe Lion King\u201d has given black performers an opportunity to shine on Broadway.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Lion King\u2019 is one of the first major musicals to really bring in so many people of color in this capacity,\u201d Syndee Winters, who plays Nala in N.Y.C., said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gift that keeps on giving,\u201d she added.\n\nBradley Gibson, who plays Simba, remembers sitting in the audience when he was a young kid and being impressed that there were so many people who looked like him on stage.\n\n\u201cThe Lion King was the first show I saw where I saw a full stage of people who look like me telling a story that I am familiar with,\u201d he said.\n\nLindiwe Dlamini joined the original cast of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d on Broadway in 1997 and has performed with the vocal ensemble ever since. She has more than 21 years of experience on Broadway, but she hardly ever auditions for other roles because she doesn\u2019t \u201csee any other show right now\u201d that she could fit in.\n\nAs a Broadway veteran, she wants to see more people of color create new productions on Broadway. Dlamini said Disney\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d would do well on stage.\n\n\u201cIt would give more young kids roles they can relate to on Broadway, and the ability to perform for people who look like them,\u201d she said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just important to have more diversity on stage \u2014 there need to be more people of color behind the scenes too, according to Jacquelyn Bell, a commercial theater producer and manager. Bell worked with Broadway performers, policymakers and public officials to produce \u201cBroadway for Black Lives Matter\" in 2016. The event, sponsored by the Columbia Law School, allowed for colleagues on Broadway to talk about social and racial justice issues.\n\n\u201cCasting people of color is no longer enough,\u201d Bell said. \u201dThere are so many more black and brown bodies on stage, but if you are going behind the stage and off stage \u2014 that\u2019s when you see there are still major barriers.\u201d\n\nIn a study published in 2017, Actors Equity, a labor union representing more than 51,000 actors and stage managers nationwide, found that \u201c77 percent of stage manager contracts on Broadway and production tours went to Caucasians; over three years there were only six contracts given to African-American members.\u201d\n\n\"This study came about because our council made diversity and inclusion a priority and our staff spent months working on the data,\" Mary McColl, Actors' Equity\u2019s executive director, said. \"With this study, we can take an empirical look at hiring biases in our industry. Women and members of color have fewer work opportunities, and when they do get hired, they often are hired on lower-paying contracts.\"\n\n\"Equity has fought for diversity and inclusion at the bargaining table for years. What we learned with this study is that we won't negotiate our way out of this problem.

In an answer to the complaint, attorneys for Vallejo denied the allegations and said the officer involved followed policies and procedures.\n\nVallejo, a city of more than 122,000 with a police force of about 100 officers, has seen eight cases since January 2017 in which officers fired their weapons \u2014 more than any police force in Solano County and neighboring Contra Costa County, according to the Vallejo Times-Herald. In addition, five of the department's officers have been involved in at least two shootings since 2016.\n\n\"There's a seeming failure to hold officers accountable, and it creates this environment that regardless of what you do and how you do it, you won't be disciplined,\" said Oakland civil rights attorney John Burris, who is representing McCoy's family and whose firm has filed at least six cases involving Vallejo police, including Foster's.\n\nBurris has demanded that bodycam footage be released in Foster's shooting.\n\nHe said that for the same officer to now be involved in a second shooting death is a larger concern about \"whether or not any restraints have been placed on him.\"\n\nMcCoy, who went by the stage name Willie Bo, had been in the recording studio and touring in the days before the shooting, his family said. They believe he had gone to the Taco Bell hungry and tired, and was so exhausted that he fell asleep while waiting in the drive-thru.\n\nEmployees called police at about 10:30 p.m. when they saw him slumped behind the wheel of the car with the engine running, Vallejo police said in a statement last week.\n\nPolice said McCoy woke up as they were trying to box his car in so he wouldn't suddenly move, and that he failed to listen to their commands. It's unclear how many bullets were fired within the four seconds of shooting, but another attorney for the family said she counted about 25 bullet wounds to McCoy's body, including to his face, throat and chest.\n\nWillie McCoy, right, with his cousin, David Harrison. Courtesy of David Harrison\n\nPolice bodycam footage and other documents have not been made public. Vallejo police declined to comment further Thursday, while the Vallejo Police Officers' Association said in a statement that bodycam video only tells part of the story and does not capture the \"totality of the situation with all the stimuli that the human eye and brain can see and process.\"\n\nThe officers' union also said it is not the one that puts people in these dangerous situations where \"they have guns, fail to follow commands, fail to stop when ordered to do so and so on,\" and that it is \"unreasonable to believe police officers have the skills to shoot someone in the arm or shoot the gun out of their hand. This is real life, not television.\"\n\nVallejo police confirmed Friday that all six of the officers involved in the McCoy shooting are expected to be back to \"full duty\" within the next week.\n\nOne of those officers, Thompson, had also been named in an excessive force complaint filed last year by a 49-year-old man who said he suffered a broken nose, a black eye and cuts to his body during a 2017 arrest. Another officer who was seen in bodycam footage grabbing the man left the department in October after being named in multiple force complaints, according to the Times-Herald.\n\nA 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that almost 75 percent of police officers in the United States say they have never fired their service weapon while on duty outside of required training.\n\n\"When you have someone who does it twice in at least a year, and you have other fatal shootings in your department, it raises questions about the leadership and their willingness to hold these officers accountable,\" Burris said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-bodycam-video-shows-moment-suspect-opens-fire-deputy-through-n973916", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFeb. 21, 2019, 4:53 PM GMT By Danny Cevallos\n\nActor Jussie Smollett has been charged by the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney office with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report claiming he was the victim of a hate-crime attack in Chicago.\n\nThe state alleges Smollett filed a false report with Chicago police on Jan. 29, when he claimed he was assaulted by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs.\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, speaking at a press conference, skewered Smollett and false police reports generally. He said that while no violent crimes went uninvestigated as a result of Smollett's claims, Johnson suggested that the hundreds of killings in Chicago represented a more serious problem deserving of national attention than a celebrity\u2019s allegedly false police report.\n\nDisorderly conduct is normally thought of as a low-level crime. In Illinois, however, making false reports to peace officers is actually a felony contained within the disorderly statute. A false report is a class four felony, punishable by up to three years in prison. The elements that make it such a felony are: any kind of transmission to a peace officer reporting a crime without reasonable grounds.\n\nSmollett's attorneys said in a statement Wednesday night that \u201clike any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.\" They added that they plan to \"conduct a thorough investigation\" and \"mount an aggressive defense.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Chicago police superintendent also implicated Smollett in sending a threatening letter to the set of \u201cEmpire,\u201d the show on which he worked, in the days before the supposed attack. The letter contained homophobic language and a white powder. The powder was later determined to be a pulverized, legal painkiller. Threats or hazardous substances sent in the mail fall within the jurisdiction of the federal government.\n\nIf Smollett was involved in mailing this letter to the set, potential federal charges may dwarf the disorderly conduct charge in state court in Chicago. The FBI is now investigating the letter, Anthony Guglielmi, Chicago police\u2019s chief communications officer, said this month.\n\nThere are a broad array of federal criminal statutes that protect the U.S. mail, including mailing threatening communications, mailing injurious articles, and even a federal \u201choax\u201d statute.\n\nThreatening communications contains three elements: First, the defendant threatened to injure someone. Second, the defendant deposited in the mail for delivery by the U.S. Postal Service the threatening communication. And third, the defendant mailed the threat knowingly.\n\n\u201cNonmailable matter\u201d includes \u201cinjurious articles,\u201d which means the government must prove that a defendant knowingly caused to be delivered by mail something declared nonmailable, like a harmful substance, but with the intent to injure another person. If Smollett were charged under this statute, he could counter that he never sent anything harmful, and never had the intent to actually injure anyone.\n\nThat\u2019s where the federal hoax statute would come in.\n\nThe hoax statute criminalizes \u201cconvey[ing] false \u2026 information under circumstances where such information may reasonably be believed and where such information indicates that an activity has taken, is taking, or will take place that would constitute a violation of\u201d a number of listed statutes, including the prohibition against chemical weapons.\n\nSmollett could not defend a hoax statute by arguing that there was never any actual threat because that\u2019s the whole point of a hoax: It\u2019s a false threat that causes harm in when it is believed. Nor could he claim that the First Amendment absolutely protects his right to make things up. His most viable defense may be holding the prosecution to its burden of proof.\n\nFalse and misleading information indicating an act of terrorism is not a harmless lie. Diverting law enforcement to devote unnecessary resources and causing citizens to fear a fatal terrorist attack is the sort of harm that Congress has a legitimate right to prevent by restricting speech.\n\nWhile the state court case is Smollett\u2019s immediate concern, the federal investigation could lead to charges with more serious penalties.\n\nDanny Cevallos is an MSNBC legal analyst.

And I don\u2019t know if I said this but I was certainly thinking: \u2018But what about me? You mean God\u2019s only plan for me is to be your sex toy until you get married?\u201d\n\nHenry Snow Courtesy WHenry Snow\n\nSnow spoke out as the Southern Baptist Convention is reeling from revelations that it failed to protect more than 700 worshippers from 220 ministers, deacons, volunteers, Sunday school teachers and others who were found guilty of sexually abusing churchgoers over 20 years.\n\nJ.D. Greear, the convention's president, unveiled plans on Monday to tackle the crisis that has shaken the largest evangelical denomination in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere is a problem,\u201d Greear said in prepared remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s time we back up our words with actions that demonstrate our concern about this.\u201d\n\nSnow, who is 67 and lives in Austin, Texas, applauded Greear\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time. It\u2019s great news to hear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a disease in our country and around the world that adults are preying on kids with no reckoning around it.\u201d\n\nSnow said he never reported what he says happened to him to church authorities or the police. He said he was emboldened to come forward with his story after a recent expose of the Southern Baptist Convention by The Houston Chronicle and The San Antonio Express-News.\n\n\u201cBack then, nobody would have believed me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been carrying this around with me for a long time.\u201d\n\nNBC News is not identifying Snow\u2019s alleged abuser, who is now in his 70s, because he was never charged with a crime. But Snow provided NBC News with an email the alleged abuser sent him in February 2012.\n\nIn it, the alleged predator does not explicitly admit to molesting him, but he is apologetic and refers to Snow as a \u201cdear old friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI regret invading your space by trying to be your best buddy and closest friend,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCalling him \"Bill,\" which was how Snow was known in the 1960s and '70s, the alleged abuser wrote that he was reaching out because a relative of Snow's had alluded to \"something that went on between the two of you.\"\n\n\"I do recall some of our times together and will readily apologize for being so sure that if I dug deep enough into the things of your past and could figure it out, I could fix all the past and encourage you into a stable future,\" he wrote. \"I have read a lot of books on forgiveness and have tried hard to implement that lifestyle. ... I hope you haven't put this down and burned it because I'm not trying to preach but rather share my heart with you as a dear old friend.\"\n\nThe writer closed by inviting Snow to call him, giving him his Dallas cellphone number.\n\n\"You remain in my heart and mind the very special guy that everybody loved so much back then,\" he wrote. \"I will really be so glad to see you and spend some time together unhindered by a schedule, if you would like.\"\n\nSnow said he didn't take him up on the offer.\n\n\u201cMy first instinct was to write him back and say sarcastically, \u2018What exactly is it you\u2019re apologizing for?'\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cBut I let a little time pass and then a little more and then finally decided I didn\u2019t want to give him any more of my life. I didn\u2019t write him back.\u201d\n\nWhen NBC News called the number in the email, the man Snow has accused of sexual abuse answered on the first ring.\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d he replied, after the reporter explained he was calling about Snow and what allegedly happened a half-century earlier.\n\nIn a follow-up email to NBC News, the accused man admitted he knows both Snow and his family and insisted \"we remained friends for some time after the alleged trip.\"\n\n\"Never once was there a discussion by him regarding me 'taking advantage of him' as he now alleges,\" he wrote. \"Strange that such should come up now 50 years later ... I have not ever 'taken advantage' of anyone on a mission trip, in a church trip, in a church related setting or in a mission related setting.\"\n\nOn his personal website, the man describes himself as a married grandfather who does volunteer work with low-income children in Texas and in Central America.\n\nTo that, Snow said: \u201cHe still has access to children.\"\n\nSnow said he was adopted at birth and that his adoptive parents split up when he was 3.\n\nHenry Snow's senior yearbook photo. Courtesy Henry Snow\n\n\u201cI was a young man in search of a father figure, desperate to feel loved,\u201d he said. \u201cI have considered myself bisexual my entire life. But what happened with him crossed the line.\u201d\n\nSnow said he and three other male members of the church choir had gone on a trip to Galveston, Texas, with his alleged abuser and another male adult chaperone.\n\nThat night, he said, they all bunked in a motel room and he found himself sharing the roll-out bed with his alleged predator. He said when the lights went off and everybody else seemed to be asleep, the man reached for him.\n\n\u201cThe first time took me completely by surprise,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI woke to him fondling me.\u201d\n\nSnow said the alleged abuser set up their second sexual encounter a month later. He said he went willingly but soon regretted it.\n\n\u201cHe made it this dirty thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI never recovered from that.\u201d\n\nSnow said his life veered off course after that. He left the church and cut ties with just about everybody he knew. He shelved his dream of becoming an actor after his mother warned him \u201cthere are a lot of homosexuals in the theater.\u201d At 32, he got married and was divorced 13 months later.\n\n\u201cI ran the other way and I lived my life on a different track because of that,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, Snow found a kindred spirit in his second wife, Lynn, and they moved to Eugene, Oregon, hoping to start anew. They have a 25-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cWe met in 1991 or \u201992 and started dating and confiding in each other,\u201d Lynn Snow said. \u201cI have sexual abuse in my background as well. \u2026 It was a shared experience we both had, so we could understand and empathize with each other.\u201d\n\nBut it also took a toll on their marriage, which ended in divorce after 12 years, Lynn Snow said.\n\nSnow, she said, suffered from a lack of self-esteem and \u201ccontrol issues\u201d that she attributes directly to the abuse he says he suffered.\n\n\u201cPeople who go through something like this feel a lot of shame, a lot of guilt,\u201d she said. \"I know I didn\u2019t tell anybody what happened to me for years and years. It put a dark cloud over his life.\u201d\n\nGary Plouff said that he met Snow in Eugene and that he also confided in him about the abuse.\n\n\u201cWe were getting to know each other and he wanted to tell me about things that happened in his life,\u201d he said. \u201cI had my own sexual abuse issue with priests when I was 14, 15.\u201d\n\nLynn Snow and Plouff both said Snow was \u201cstartled\u201d when his alleged abuser suddenly emailed him.\n\n\u201cI guess a relative of his knew that person and gave him Henry\u2019s email,\u201d Plouff said.\n\nSnow said that work brought him back to Texas, and that he reconnected with his adoptive dad\u2019s family briefly and met his birth sisters in recent years. But he\u2019s never considered darkening the doorway of the Baptist church, and he can\u2019t help wonder what his life might have been like had he not been molested.\n\n\u201cThough I know the conditions of my life could have been much worse, I cannot escape the feeling that my life has been a basket of unfulfilled potential,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bittersweet experience.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/el-chapo-juror-says-panelists-regularly-broke-judge-s-order-n973641", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFeb. 19, 2019, 9:45 AM GMT / Updated Feb. 19, 2019, 3:03 PM GMT By Jon Schuppe\n\nIn February 2015, a Georgia prison inmate mailed a handwritten complaint to the federal court in Macon, saying he\u2019d been held in a windowless cell for nearly 24 hours a day for five years.\n\nThe inmate, a convicted rapist named Timothy Gumm, said he\u2019d been put there after a failed escape attempt in January 2010 and was told he\u2019d remain there indefinitely, even after the escape charge was wiped from his disciplinary record. He lost contact with loved ones, dropped 50 pounds and was \u201cdeprived of almost any environmental and sensory stimuli and of almost all human contact,\u201d he wrote. He saw no way out.\n\n\u201cI hate that I even have to trouble you and the court with this matter,\u201d Gumm wrote in a cover letter to the court clerk.\n\nThat longshot filing, written on 11 pages of loose-leaf paper without a lawyer\u2019s help, persuaded a skeptical judge to listen, and to eventually force Georgia to open up its isolation unit to outsiders. A social psychologist who\u2019d studied prison conditions for 40 years was shocked at what he saw: metal cells without openings, including one smeared with blood; mentally ill prisoners screaming in anguish; and a crudely drawn sign that said, \u201cHELP.\u201d\n\nA \"HELP\" sign on a cell in E-Wing. Craig Haney\n\nThe psychologist\u2019s report, released publicly last year, led to a settlement in which the state agreed in January to curtail its use of solitary confinement \u2014 a small step in America\u2019s slow-moving shift away from a practice that human rights advocates call torture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a conversation about is this something we should be doing,\u201d said Sara Sullivan, who leads the nonprofit Vera Institute\u2019s work with state prison systems to curtail solitary confinement. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of momentum for this. But we still have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nA turning tide on solitary confinement\n\nSolitary confinement has flourished in American jails and prisons since the 1980s and \u02bc90s as a way of controlling dangerous inmates, punishing a misdeed or protecting vulnerable prisoners from the general population. Dozens of states, as well as the Federal Bureau of Prisons, have built \u201csupermax\u201d facilities where solitary confinement is standard. An estimated 61,000 people \u2500 including juveniles, pregnant women and the mentally ill \u2500 were held in solitary confinement in 2017, according to the most recent comprehensive count by the Association of State Correctional Administrators and the Arthur Liman Center for Public Interest Law at Yale Law School.\n\nThe numbers were once even higher, but have declined as more elected leaders and corrections officials have acknowledged that solitary confinement is overused and misused, with many inmates being sent back into society when their sentences end. Some researchers say the practice causes permanent psychological damage, while others say it makes inmates more likely to get into trouble after their release.\n\nAround the country, from Maine to Colorado to Virginia and in Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court, authorities are reconsidering solitary confinement through new laws, policies, court opinions and legal settlements. Many are influenced by harrowing recollections of life in solitary confinement \u2014 like the tale of Anthony Gay, who was locked up as a teen for allegedly stealing a dollar bill and ended up spending 22 years in solitary confinement in Illinois. Others react to a streak of inmate suicides, as in Alabama recently.\n\nAn inmate in a Special Management Unit recreation cage. Craig Haney\n\nCritics of solitary confinement include Rick Raemisch, director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, whose predecessor, Tom Clements, was murdered in 2013 by a man who\u2019d just been released after seven years in solitary confinement.\n\nIn the wake of Clements\u2019 death, Raemisch worked to reduce solitary confinement, and Colorado eventually enacted the country\u2019s strictest limit, 15 days at a time, which meets the United Nations\u2019 \u201cMandela Rules\u201d for treatment of prisoners. (The United States is not bound by those standards.)\n\n\u201cWhen did it ever become OK to lock someone in a cell the size of a parking space 23 hours a day for years?\u201d Raemisch says in a video tweeted last month by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn 2015, several Supreme Court justices condemned solitary confinement in written opinions. In 2016, President Barack Obama moved to curtail solitary confinement in federal prisons and cited Kalief Browder, who spent years in solitary confinement on New York\u2019s Rikers Island while awaiting trial and killed himself after being released from prison. The same year, the American Correctional Association, which recommends standards for prisons, called for restrictions on solitary confinement, particularly for the mentally ill. In December, Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed, the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill that includes a ban on solitary confinement for juveniles in federal lockups.\n\nIn several states, lawsuits by or on behalf of inmates have led to settlements that forced prison officials to ease up on the use of solitary confinement.\n\n\u201cWe are really reaching a tipping point both in terms of corrections culture and the recognition that solitary confinement makes us worse off and doesn\u2019t lead to safe and effective prisons,\u201d said Amy Fettig, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s National Prison Project. \u201cThe public is also becoming more conscious about what people are subjected to behind bars in this country.\u201d\n\nIn Georgia, Fettig said, Gumm\u2019s lawsuit revealed an \u201cextreme use of solitary confinement,\u201d described in such detail that it \u201csounded like a medieval dungeon.\u201d\n\nA \u2018man made Hell\u2019\n\nGumm\u2019s handwritten lawsuit made it to U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles H. Weigle, who acknowledged having \u201cserious reservations as to the ultimate validity\u201d of Gumm\u2019s claims. Laws aimed at curtailing frivolous lawsuits make it hard for inmates to protest prison conditions, and judges set a high bar for hearing such complaints. But Weigle noticed that several other of the 180 or so inmates in the Special Management Unit at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison were making similar claims. He eventually let Gumm\u2019s complaint go forward, and assigned lawyers from the Southern Center for Human Rights to represent him free of charge.\n\nOnce the nonprofit civil rights firm got involved, the lawsuit picked up speed. Other inmates joined. And Weigle allowed the center\u2019s two lawyers, Sarah Geraghty and Ryan Primerano, to hire University of California, Santa Cruz social psychologist Craig Haney, one of the country\u2019s top experts in solitary confinement conditions, to tour the unit and talk to inmates there.\n\n\u201cI saw things there I\u2019d never seen before,\u201d Haney told NBC News.\n\nVisiting in October 2017, Haney said he was struck in particular by cells, about 7 by 13-and-a-half feet, with solid metal doors and metal shields over windows, that he said \u201chermetically sealed\u201d inmates inside. Brief recreation time was confined to outdoor metal cages.\n\nHe noted a disturbingly high number of mentally ill inmates \u2500 about 70 out of 180. He also observed many who had not been diagnosed but seemed to be unraveling psychologically \u2500 cutting themselves, smearing their cells with blood, eating their feces, swallowing batteries and razors in an attempting to kill themselves. In his report, Haney described one wing of the unit as \u201cbedlam-like,\u201d filled with the \u201ccacophony of prisoner screams and cries for help.\u201d\n\nTimothy Gumm mailed a complaint to federal court saying he'd been held in a windowless cell for nearly 24 hours a day for five years in a Georgia prison. Georgia Department of Corrections\n\nInmates told Haney they had no sense of when, or whether, they\u2019d ever return to the general population. Most only left the unit when they had completed their sentences.\n\nHaney examined recent suicides on the unit, including the death of Jamie Green, 45, who hanged himself after two years in solitary.\n\nGreen, serving a 50-year sentence for child molestation, had been sent to the Special Management Unit in his third month in prison after a fight with an officer. He had attempted suicide in 2013, before his prison sentence, and had received mental health treatment. A counselor said he needed monitoring. But he was not put on the prison\u2019s mental health caseload, where he could have received more care.\n\nAs his time in solitary stretched on, Green grew despondent.\n\nOn Nov. 7, 2017, not long after losing an appeal of his conviction, Green wrote his sister, Kim Knott, one of dozens of letters he sent from solitary. He called his cell a \u201cman made Hell.\u201d\n\nJamie Green hanged himself in solitary confinement in 2017. Courtesy of Kim Knott\n\nKnott received the letter two days later, and thought he was planning to take his life. She planned to call the prison the next morning, but that night the prison called to say he was dead.\n\n\"Our hearts are crushed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a big empty hole in your heart that will never be filled. He didn't deserve what he got.\"\n\nHaney concluded in his report that the unit was \u201cone of the harshest and most draconian such facilities I have seen in operation anywhere in the country,\u201d housing some of the \u201cmost psychologically traumatized persons I have ever assessed in this context.\u201d He also noted that the unit was operating \u201cin clear violation of a widespread and growing national and international professional, legal, and correctional consensus\u201d about the harms of solitary confinement.\n\nA step toward reform in Georgia\n\nA few months after Haney\u2019s report became public, Georgia\u2019s Department of Corrections agreed in December to limit solitary confinement to two years. The agency also allowed prisoners in the Special Management Unit more time out of their cells and required more education and mental health treatment. Advocates said the settlement isn\u2019t as far-reaching as they\u2019d like to see \u2500 Georgia still releases people straight from solitary to the street at the end of their sentences, Geraghty said \u2500 but it\u2019s a significant step.\n\nAn inmate shows self-inflicted lacerations inside his solitary confinement cell in E-Wing. The inmate's face was redacted by Haney in his report. Craig Haney\n\nThe Georgia Department of Corrections said in statement that it \u201crecognizes the national reforms surrounding restrictive housing, and we are actively engaged in moving forward with internal procedures that address these trends.\u201d The number of people put in solitary confinement has already been reduced by 40 percent since 2017, the agency said.\n\nThat decline includes Gumm, who is serving a life sentence. He was transferred out of solitary confinement in July 2017 after more than seven years there, Geraghty said.\n\nShe credits his \u201cexceptionally thoughtful, detailed and well-written\u201d complaint for prompting Georgia\u2019s reforms. He has since written lawsuits on behalf of other inmates and writes creatively as well, Geraghty said. He wants to study law, and has applied to help teach fellow prisoners.\n\nBut a settlement does not guarantee change. California agreed three years ago to curtail its use of solitary confinement, but a judge recently found that the state had violated the settlement\u2019s terms.\n\n\u201cPrisons are by definition closed institutions,\u201d Geraghty said. \u201cAnd sunshine can only help.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (Feb. 19, 2019, 10:04 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misidentified the sister of Jamie Green, a prisoner who died by suicide in solitary confinement.

But after arriving at her job in a meatpacking plant near Morristown in East Tennessee, she suddenly heard officers yelling at workers to put up their hands, she said.\n\n\u201cFrom one moment to the next, the plant turned to chaos,\u201d Pulido said in Spanish. Immigration officers yelled and dashed throughout the plant, she said. She could hear helicopters.\n\nAt the time, it was the largest work-site raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in nearly a decade, with nearly 100 workers taken into custody on suspicion of being in the country illegally.\n\nOn Thursday, two advocacy groups and a law firm filed a lawsuit against immigration officers, accusing them of unlawful searches and arrests, racial profiling and excessive force.\n\n\"When a raid of this scale happens in our communities, it's like a bomb goes off,\" Stephanie Teatro, executive co-director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, said during a news teleconference Thursday announcing the lawsuit.\n\nAttorneys said it was the first lawsuit against a large-scale work-site raid conducted by the Trump administration.\n\nIn the aftermath of the raid, hundreds of people gathered at a church, desperately trying to find their family members, and nearly 600 children from the district missed school.\n\n\"As the tragedy and chaos unfolded on that day, it was a painful reminder of why the government had stopped using this egregious enforcement tactic almost a decade before,\" Teatro said.\n\nPulido said one of her co-workers slipped and fell, and immigration officers \u201cdrew their guns at her.\u201d She said she saw one officer hit an employee in the face and another push a colleague.\n\nMartha Pulido Isaias Guerrero\n\n\u201cWhy the excessive use of arms and violence? The only thing we were doing was making a living to support our families,\u201d she said.\n\nThe suit was filed in federal court in Knoxville by the National Immigration Law Center, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the law firm of Sherrard, Roe, Voigt and Harbison on behalf of seven named workers and about 100 unnamed ones who were detained during the raid. The suit, which names nine federal officials and includes 30 unnamed ICE agents, claims the workers' rights were violated and seeks monetary and punitive damages.\n\nMeredith Stewart, a senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said what happened during the raid was illegal.\n\n\u201cICE agents stormed the meatpacking plant looking for Latino workers without knowing their identities or immigration status,\u201d she said. \u201cThey detained those workers solely on the basis of their race, using intrusive, militaristic and even violent measures. This is law enforcement overreach, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nMelissa Keaney, a staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, said ICE officers were at the meatpacking plant, Southeastern Provision in Bean Station, that day with a search warrant for financial documents for alleged crimes by the plant\u2019s owner.\n\n\u201cBut clearly, their purpose that day and intent was far broader than what the warrant itself authorized,\u201d Keaney said.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told NBC News it does not comment on pending litigation, but that, in general, \"ICE activities are conducted in full compliance with federal law and agency policy.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations division \"equally focused\" enforcement efforts on employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers as well as those employees.\n\n\"The Southeastern Provision case was always a federal criminal investigation that also resulted in administrative immigration arrests,\" the spokesperson said. \"To describe the operation as an immigration enforcement action is inaccurate; it was a federal criminal investigation that also resulted in immigration arrests.\"\n\nAt the time of the raid, ICE said that of the 97 people detained, 86 were arrested on administrative charges and placed in deportation proceedings, with 54 placed in detention centers and 32 being released.\n\nSince then, advocates said Thursday that 40 have been released on bond, five remain in federal custody, six have been deported and 12 agreed to voluntary departure, in which an immigrant agrees to leave the country rather than go through a formal deportation process.\n\nAttorneys on Thursday declined to discuss the immigration status of the plaintiffs at the time of the raid, saying they did not believe it was relevant to the claims in the lawsuit and alleging that ICE agents used race as a proxy for determining workers' suspected immigration status.\n\nThe Tennessee raid was followed by a pattern of other large workplace raids \u2014 at least one, in Ohio, was larger \u2014 after the Trump administration's pledge to step up arrests at companies accused of employing immigrants who are not authorized to work in the United States.\n\nThe owner of the meatpacking plant, James Brantley, pleaded guilty in September to federal charges of tax fraud, wire fraud and hiring immigrants unauthorized to work in the country and is awaiting sentencing, according to ICE."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/u-s-could-limit-asylum-family-members-threatened-harm-n973966", "text": "Feb. 21, 2019, 5:43 PM GMT By Suzanne Gamboa\n\nThe Trump administration is considering narrowing the pathway for granting asylum to immigrants based on claims that violence or threats of violence against their family members also puts them at risk.\n\nPeople can seek asylum protection in the United States if they have a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for the bad guys to say to one person, 'If you don\u2019t do what we say, we are going to harm your family,'\u201d Bradley Jenkins, an attorney who works with Catholic Legal Immigration Network Inc., told NBC News.\n\nHistorically, a social group has included family ties, said Jenkins, who is challenging the administration's move on behalf of a client identified only by the initials L.E.A.\n\nThreats against such immigrants, experts say, are often a means of extortion.\n\nBut former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker decided to review whether family membership as a \u201csocial group\u201d meets a more stringent test, a change that could affect thousands. The new attorney general, William Barr, could pass on the case, though that would run counter to his predecessors' use of their authority to review criteria for asylum claims.\n\n\"If someone is going to hurt you because of who you're family is ... \"\n\nJenkins' client argued that it was his family ties that put him in danger when he sought asylum.\n\nL.E.A. was denied asylum by a lower court and by the Bureau of Immigration Appeals, but the appeals panel upheld the principle that having a well-founded fear of persecution on account of family membership can be considered a protected characteristic for asylum purposes, Jenkins said.\n\nThe law allows the attorney general to review decisions by the appeals bureau, so Whitaker referred the case to himself to determine \"whether and under what circumstances an asylum-seeker may establish persecution on account of membership in a particular group based on membership in a family unit.\"\n\nOriginally from Mexico, L.E.A. fled to the United States in 1998. While in the United States, a Mexican cartel falsely told his father in 2009 that they had kidnapped L.E.A. in an extortion scheme.\n\nL.E.A. returned to Mexico in 2011, after being granted voluntary departure, a forced removal from the United States in which the immigrant agrees to leave the country rather than go through a formal deportation process.\n\nBack in Mexico, L.E.A. learned that his father had refused to allow La Familia Michoacana cartel to sell drugs through his grocery and general merchandise store. The cartel targeted L.E.A., shooting at him and trying to kidnap him. He escaped four masked men who tried to push him into a car.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if someone is going to hurt you because of who your family is, that is right in line with what the asylum law protects,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has agreed with that view, saying in a 2016 brief that in virtually every society in the world, families qualify as particular social groups, he said.\n\nPotential to upend \"basics of asylum law\u201d\n\nThe Bureau of Immigration Appeals first considered what a social group means in asylum law in 1985. The panel said it means things based on characteristics that are fundamental to identity and conscience, like kinship ties. The appeals bureau has upheld the idea several times since, Jenkins said, which makes the administration's latest move so distressing to immigrant-rights advocates.\n\n\u201cAny proposal to upset the apple cart here is really one that has the potential to fundamentally upend the basics of asylum law,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nHowever, Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for a severe reduction in immigration, said the attorney general's review is needed to provide \u201cbright line guidance\u201d on this part of asylum law.\n\nHe argues that people like L.E.A. are the victims of crimes, but are not targeted because his family belongs to a particular social group.\n\nIn a hypothetical example, a woman requesting asylum because gangs are trying to recruit her son should not be eligible for asylum, he said.\n\n\u201cCrime happens thousands of times a day in Baltimore, but the vast majority of the crime victims would not be eligible for asylum in Mexico or Canada because they had been crime victims in the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nThe review of the asylum issue comes after Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, used the same process to decide that victims of domestic and gang violence were not eligible for asylum. In that decision, Sessions questioned whether family membership should be grounds for asylum. A federal judge has struck down parts of Sessions' decision.\n\nSessions used his authority to certify immigration cases to himself and review them eight times in the first 10 months of 2018, and Whitaker did so twice in four months. During eight years of the Obama administration, the attorney general at the time used that authority four times, according to the Catholic Legal Immigration Clinic.\n\nM. Lucero Ortiz, director of legal services for the Central American Resource Center in Washington, said many of the migrants coming to the United States now are fleeing the violence stemming from a family member who was or is associated with a gang, or from a family member who owns a business that is targeted by cartels and gangs.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of bus drivers who refuse to pay 'rent,' and so the whole family is targeted,\" Ortiz said, using slang for extortion money. \"They tell them if you don\u2019t pay, I know where your wife and children are.\"\n\nAn attorney general decision restricting family membership as grounds for asylum would be challenged in court, but while the case is pending, \u201cwe are very afraid \u2026 people are going to be erroneously deported,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\n\u201cThis is a basis upon which many people have applied for asylum for a long time,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThe proposal to close this door is not based on the law as its been interpreted for the past 34 years and would put a lot of people in very real danger.\"\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-mother-arrested-posting-video-high-school-fight-social-media-n974146", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFeb. 21, 2019, 9:57 AM GMT By Mike Memoli\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Joe Biden wants to be president.\n\nAnd each day, he\u2019s closer to being ready to run for the office. But even as he weighs a campaign to unseat President Donald Trump, Biden is carefully considering a crucial question \u2014 what happens when the president or his top allies try to make his family an issue?\n\nConversations with aides to the former vice president and others who\u2019ve spoken with him in recent weeks present the idea of a Biden candidacy as not if but when. Since the start of the year it\u2019s been like a \u201cslow boil,\u201d as one aide put it, with Biden\u2019s answer on whether to run moving in a steady direction toward yes, incrementally warmer with each passing day.\n\nElected Democrats and key party figures who\u2019ve spoken with Biden, in person or by phone, say he has been giving percentages of the likelihood of him running \u2014 from 70, to 80 and even more recently 90 percent. He speaks regularly with former President Barack Obama, who is acting as a sounding board to his former running mate. And he\u2019s even called several of his would-be opponents in the 2020 Democratic primary, congratulating them on their announcements and wishing them well even as he may soon face off against them.\n\nSources close to the former vice president say he\u2019s clear-eyed about the political challenge ahead if he runs, not taking anything for granted in a crowded race for the nomination even as he\u2019s confident he offers the party the best chance to beat Trump.\n\nBut Biden knows and expects the president to fight as hard to stay in the White House as he did to win it in the first place \u2014 and he\u2019s already shown nothing is off limits.\n\n\u201cI understand how anyone running could be concerned about the ways in which President Trump demonstrated in the 2016 election an enthusiasm for attacking not just his opponents but his family, including famously by making things up,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who met with Biden recently to discuss the campaign.\n\n\u201cI offered my general advice that he should do what he does best, which is focus on the positive and let others take up the mantle of defending his family, his record and his honor to the extent that\u2019s at all necessary,\u201d Coons told NBC News.\n\nNo line of attack would be more reprehensible to Biden than one directed at his family, and he and his team have been forced to consider that even as they also weigh the political dynamics.\n\nBiden is the senior statesman and a largely popular figure in a Democratic Party eager to unite quickly behind someone who can win back the White House. But he\u2019s also a grandfather and a father trying to keep his family together.\n\nBiden told his closest aides this week he has a few final \u201ctraps\u201d to run before a final decision \u2014 including gut-check conversations with his children and grandchildren.\n\n\u201cFamily is the beginning, the middle and the end. Everything revolves around family,\u201d Biden said at one of his few public events in recent weeks.\n\nThe initial shock over the passing of his eldest son, Beau, four years ago has passed. But the grieving process never ends \u2014 it just takes new forms, as Biden knows better than most. And weeks after the family marked what would have been Beau\u2019s 50th birthday, how his absence continues to weigh on the family is something Biden remains mindful of as the family patriarch.\n\nDiscussions among his inner circle have included simulating what would happen on the campaign trail if Biden were asked to respond to a fresh Trump tweet or public comment directed at Biden\u2019s family.\n\nThe trials Biden and his family have endured will undoubtedly be part of the discussion around his candidacy regardless of what the president does. His wife, Jill, has written a book due out in May that its publisher promises will be a \u201cbrave and vulnerable glimpse into the creation of a beloved American family.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s second son, Hunter, has also acknowledged the complications of his personal life recently \u2014 a difficult divorce and battles with substance abuse. In a recent statement to Vanity Fair, he insisted they wouldn\u2019t affect his father\u2019s 2020 planning.\n\n\u201cThe priority has always been clear for my dad, as it is, now, for me: Never run from a struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that I wouldn\u2019t be alive today, if my dad hadn\u2019t kept fighting for me, too. So the idea that tragedy or tough times or any number of trials would dissuade a Biden from serving his fellow man\u2014 whether a friend or a fellow citizen \u2014 could not be more misguided.\u201d\n\nBiden, indeed, emerged from the holidays more convinced the family is ready for a campaign. They have taken great comfort in returning to their annual rituals, he said at a recent event discussing his 2017 book, \u201cPromise Me, Dad.\u201d\n\nThat book\u2019s title is drawn from the conversation he had with Beau in his final months, when his son urged him not to withdraw from fighting for the causes that have animated him during his decades in public life. Remembering his son\u2019s commitment to duty is something Biden said brings him solace and a sense of purpose.\n\n\u201cI get up every morning hoping that Beau\u2019s proud of me,\u201d Biden said at the event, adding later: \u201cI want \u2026 Beau\u2019s son and daughter to know I was true to their dad\u2019s wishes.\u201d\n\nWhen Biden passed on the 2016 race he did so understanding it may have been his last chance to seek the presidency. But Hillary Clinton\u2019s shocking defeat to Trump affords Biden, at 76, a final unexpected opportunity, at a time when he feels his skills and experience are needed perhaps more than ever.\n\nStill, he\u2019s also facing the ticking clock of a primary race already underway, a dwindling supply of talent needed to staff a winning campaign, and the already-bubbling impatience of rival campaigns and would-be candidates looking for a definitive answer from the former vice president so they can make their own.\n\n\u201cI think that we have a tendency particularly in the States to start the whole election process much too early,\u201d he said during an appearance at the Munich Security Conference. \u201cI think we should be focusing now on what needs to be done to alter some of the policies that are being promoted by the president.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s team has long been working to lay the groundwork for a campaign for months, with mid-March as something of a moving target. Once given a green light, it would likely take another week or two before any public launch \u2014 realistically putting the start into the second fundraising quarter after April 1.\n\nBiden\u2019s public schedule has largely been oriented toward the higher education institutions where he has rooted his life since leaving the White House \u2014 an event at the Penn Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania this week, and one at the newly renamed Joseph R. Biden Jr. School of Public Policy & Administration at the University of Delaware next Tuesday.\n\nHe will also appear at the University of Nebraska at Omaha next week \u2014 just across the river from Iowa. Those events are somewhat controlled environments where Biden can focus on the issues he sees as setting him apart in a crowded field \u2014 foreign policy, and his appeal to middle-class voters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t begrudge anybody making a million or hundreds of millions of dollars. I really don\u2019t,\u201d Biden said at Tuesday\u2019s event in Philadelphia. \u201cBut I do think there\u2019s some shared responsibility and it\u2019s not being shared fairly for hard-working, middle-class and working-class people.\u201d\n\nAs it bided time until a decision, his political team distributed talking points to a small network of outside allies to make the case, arguing that voters are looking for a \u201ctrusted leader\u201d who \u201cprovides a sense of unity for a country that is desperate for a sense of stability.\u201d\n\nSeveral of those points invoke a unique bond Biden has with the public in part because of his own family\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cYou only have to spend a few minutes with Biden out on the campaign trail to see the ferocity with which people believe in him,\" one talking point reads. \"They hug him, they implore him to run, they tell him their family\u2019s personal struggle. There is a passion for him that is unique.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/hud-toughens-housing-inspections-prevent-landlords-gaming-system-n973721", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The agency described its decision as a \u201cdramatic\u201d change that would discourage cosmetic, last-minute repairs to housing for low-income Americans, according to a press release issued Wednesday.\n\nThe department first floated the idea of tightening the inspection notification window in a meeting with industry stakeholders in late November, two weeks after NBC News published an investigation into the broken inspection process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become painfully clear to us that too many public housing authorities and private landlords whom we contract with were using the weeks before their inspection to make quick fixes, essentially gaming the system,\u201d Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said in the press statement Wednesday.\n\nIf a property owner or agent refuses a scheduled inspection, the property will automatically get a score of zero, according to the notice detailing the change. A failed inspection is supposed to prompt swift enforcement action by the department, which can conduct follow-up assessments, impose fines or cancel contracts with delinquent landlords, among other steps.\n\nThe department's move is part of its broader overhaul of the inspection system that federal officials acknowledge is \"broken.\" The agency said it will hold a series of \u201clistening sessions\u201d in Philadelphia; Fort Worth, Texas; Atlanta; Detroit and Seattle to assist that reform effort, and additional changes may follow.\n\nNBC's investigation uncovered HUD properties that passed inspection despite decrepit living conditions. It found that in some cases, the department had failed to take prompt action against negligent landlords.\n\nIn the agency's November meeting with stakeholders, the agency proposed a seven-day notification window for landlords, but industry groups pushed back strongly against the idea.\n\nThe Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, which represents housing officials, said the newly announced 14-day window still went too far. \u201cIt is unworkable,\u201d said Tim Kaiser, the group\u2019s executive director, arguing that the change would unfairly burden property managers.\n\nKaiser said the department's move failed to address the bigger problems that were driving poor living conditions in its housing: a chronic lack of funding, which makes it difficult to conduct basic repairs and maintenance, as well as what he described as a flawed, \u201cvery subjective\u201d inspection tool that does not accurately assess housing conditions.\n\nDiane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which advocates for affordable housing, said she welcomed the department's effort to overhaul its inspection system, but she said that bigger reforms and more funding were sorely needed.\n\n\u201cAfter eight months of hints, buildup and tough talk from HUD on the big changes coming to REAC, an announcement of a series of listening sessions is disappointing,\u201d Yentel said, referring to the department\u2019s Real Estate Assessment Center, which conducts the inspections. \u201cWhat have they been doing all this time?\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mike-pompeo-says-he-has-ruled-out-running-senate-seat-n973906", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Sabraw said he would continue to consider the motion by the ACLU, but seemed to be leaning in favor of granting it.\n\n\"It's important to recognize we are talking about human beings,\" Sabraw told Scott Stewart, a lawyer from the Justice Department.\n\nStewart argued that including parents separated from their children as far back as July 2017 in the lawsuit \"dramatically changes the complexity of this case from the government's perspective.\"\n\n\"We have tried to be a good partner,\" Stewart said. \"It's very unfortunate to have done all that [and then] to have the task flown wide open.\"\n\nStewart suggested that parents whose children were taken from them prior to zero tolerance should file elsewhere or through \"informal channels.\"\n\n\"We're not saying that they can't be reunified. We're saying that it's just not part of the class the court certified, it's not part of this case. And if there are folks in this category who want to seek relief, there are courts, there are informal channels available to do that,\" Stewart said.\n\nJudge Sabraw said the first step of his order, should he issue it, would be to do an accounting of all the parents and children separated between July 2017 and April 2018, when zero tolerance went into effect. He said he may consider other remedies, such as different timelines, but that the central remedy would be reunification.\n\nACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said his organization would put together a steering committee to make calls and find the parents of the separated children.\n\n\"We cannot go back into these communities and tell them we are not going to make the effort,\" said Gelernt. \"I suspect there are parents who want to get their children back and have not been able to.\"\n\nSome parents separated under zero tolerance chose to be deported while their children remained in the United States to seek asylum.

Doug Jones in 2020 as the GOP tries to reclaim the high-profile seat previously held by Jeff Sessions.\n\nByrne, 64, is the first Republican to announce his candidacy in what is expected to be a crowded primary field seeking to unseat Jones, the first Democrat elected to the seat in a quarter century.\n\n\u201cI want a U.S. senator who will fight for you and me,\u201d Byrne said in making his announcement before supporters in the south Alabama city of Mobile. He used his speech to express support for a border wall, gun rights and to also voice his opposition to abortion.\n\nThe primary is to be held March 3, 2020.\n\nJones\u2019 campaign issued a statement calling Byrne a \u201ccareer politician.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Senator Jones has 1 opponent or 100. His focus is working for the people of Alabama whether it\u2019s protecting our auto jobs and farmers against dangerous tariffs or building health care infrastructure in Alabama\u2019s rural communities,\u201d the Democrat\u2019s campaign statement said.\n\nJones, a former U.S. attorney best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for Birmingham\u2019s infamous 1963 church bombing, is the lone Democrat currently holding statewide office in Alabama. Jones won the 2017 special election to replace Sessions by defeating Republican Roy Moore, who faced multiple sexual misconduct allegations, which he denied.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Byrne said Jones doesn\u2019t represent \u201cAlabama\u2019s interests and Alabama values.\u201d He criticized Jones\u2019 decision to vote against the confirmation of President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and said that \u201cturned off a lot an awful lot of Alabama citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to stand with President Trump or are you going to be against President Trump?\u201d Byrne said.\n\nJones said in September that he was voting no because of concerns about the \u201cincomplete\u201d vetting of Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination and the \u201ccredible\u201d testimony of a woman who said Kavanaugh assaulted her when they were teens. Kavanaugh denied the allegations.\n\nAfter Sessions resigned as U.S. attorney general at Trump\u2019s request in November, speculation had swirled that he might make a bid for his old Senate seat, but he has taken no public action in that direction so far.\n\nByrne said he has spoken with Sessions, but that Sessions should be the one to disclose his own future political intentions.\n\nByrne was elected to Congress in 2013 from Alabama\u2019s 1st Congressional District. He was previously in the Alabama Senate and a chancellor of the Alabama Community College System.\n\nAn outspoken critic of the then-powerful teachers\u2019 lobby, Byrne made an unsuccessful bid for Alabama governor in 2010. He lost the Republican primary after the lobby helped fund attack ads against him during the primary.\n\nThe 2020 race is expected to bring a crowded GOP field with a number of top state Republicans considering runs.

Raising his voice, Graham finally told Shanahan he should consider him \"an adversary,\" according to the officials.\n\nShanahan shot back at Graham, asking if he has any more questions \"as an adversary.\"\n\n\"It got pretty tense,\" recalled one official in the room.\n\nAnother person familiar with the exchange said: \"It was heated, particularly on Graham's side.\"\n\nA U.S. defense official described the outcome differently, conceding that the exchange was heated, but said that the acting secretary of defense was ultimately able to reassure the members.\n\n\"They discussed a broad range of issues and the meeting ended on a positive note,\" the official said.\n\nGraham did not return a request for comment.\n\nShanahan was asked about the incident in an appearance at the Pentagon the day after NBC News reported on the briefing. \"I always think of Senator Graham as an ally and we have shared interests,\" Shanahan said Thursday. \"He is a problem solver and I\u2019m very confident we'll come together with a solution for Syria.\"\n\nShanahan is among several candidates under consideration to helm the Pentagon, including Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Army Secretary Mark Esper, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n\nFollowing the briefing in Munich, some members of Congress openly expressed disapproval for Shanahan to get the nomination.\n\n\"He is probably very good at securing government contracts, but it's debatable whether he knows about the military,\" said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who serves on the House Armed Services Committee. He said Shanahan does not understand the oversight, appropriations or policy roles of Congress.\n\nA staunch Trump ally on most issues, Graham has been a critic of the president's decision to pull all troops out of Syria. Even as Trump has expanded the time frame for withdrawal \u2014 from 30 days to several months \u2014 Graham has continued to oppose the policy.\n\nGraham, as a longtime leading figure in the Senate on foreign policy and national security, is an influential voice in nominations for positions like defense secretary. He was a strong supporter of Mattis, who resigned as defense secretary after the Syria withdrawal announcement.\n\nShanahan, who was Mattis' deputy, has been auditioning since January to replace him.\n\n\"Shanahan is just trying hard to do whatever Trump tells him,\" said one person familiar with the briefing last weekend. \"He's going to do everything he can to appease the president.\"\n\nThe president's decision to withdraw troops from Syria has faced strong resistance since it was announced on Dec. 19.\n\nLast week Gen. Joseph Votel, the commander of U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that while he knew about the president's overall desire to leave Syria, he was not in the loop about the announcement. \"I was not consulted,\" Votel said.\n\nThe relationship between the Pentagon and Congress has been strained in recent weeks.\n\nOn Jan. 30, during a classified briefing on another matter, one Democratic congressman scolded a group of senior Pentagon officials for lack of transparency about decisions including sending U.S. troops to the border with Mexico.\n\nThe briefing came one day after two senior Pentagon officials appeared before the House Armed Services Committee to testify about the border mission but never mentioned a decision to deploy thousands more active duty troops to the border.\n\n\"You have betrayed this committee's trust,\" a senior member of the committee said to the officials, Lt. Gen. Richard Clarke, the Joint Staff director for strategic plans and policy, and the undersecretary of defense for policy, John Rood, according to a senior congressional staff member.\n\n\"It will take years to repair the trust that you've lost,\" the lawmaker added.\n\nThat same week, the committee's chairman, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., sent a scathing letter to Shanahan, criticizing Rood for not disclosing the plan to send more troops to the border.\n\n\"At best this was an error in judgement, at worst this was knowingly withholding information from this committee as it performs its oversight responsibility,\" Smith wrote."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/europe-brexit-watching-car-crash-slow-motion-n972966", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But the referendum result sent shock waves through not only U.K.'s political establishment but Europe\u2019s, too.\n\nAt first there was sadness in Europe, but also the hope that the relationship would remain close even if Britain left the bloc.\n\nFast forward two years, and that\u2019s not quite the case anymore.\n\n\"There is disbelief and bewilderment,\" said Petros Fassoulas, the secretary general of European Movement International, a lobbying group that promotes European integration. \"It is impossible to comprehend how badly this has been handled.\"\n\nU.K. lawmakers who need to approve a divorce deal are seemingly deadlocked.\n\nIn January, Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement with the E.U. was crushed in Parliament, with more than a third of the lawmakers in her own ruling Conservative Party refusing to back it.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party is just as divided on how, or if, the U.K. should leave.

Among the consequences of the departure is an end to an era of free movement for European nationals, who currently are able to live and work in the U.K. with almost no questions asked, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate development and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been handled well.

The loss of the U.K.\u2019s influence in the E.U., as well as British culture, also saddens her.\n\n\u201cI will miss their accents,\u201d she added.\n\nWith just over a month to go before the U.K. leaves the bloc and no political solution in sight, both sides have started implementing contingency plans.\n\nIf the U.K. leaves the bloc with no framework in place for future trade, it would have economic consequences for both sides. The Bank of England has warned that the British economy could shrink by as much as 8 percent in about a year.\n\nThe hit in Europe would be less drastic, with output falling by 1.5 percent in the long run, and the employment rate decreasing by 0.7 percent, according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund. The U.K. accounts for more than 15 percent of the E.U.'s GDP.\n\nFor those dealing with the business of the E.U., Brexit has proved to be an unwelcome distraction. The E.U. has its own long list of challenges at the moment, from an influx of migrants on its southern border to high levels of youth unemployment.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, European Parliament elections are set for May, and the E.U. and related organizations are gearing up for the mammoth campaign effort that takes place every five years.\n\n\u201cMost people feel, let\u2019s get Brexit over and done with,\" said Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the European Policy Centre, an independent think tank. \"We hear similar arguments here about the U.K. to those we heard about the E.U. in the run-up to the referendum, that we can\u2019t be shackled to the corpse of the U.K.,\u201d\n\nIf anything, Brexit has highlighted the difficulties of leaving a social, economic and policy union after more than 40 years.\n\n\u201cThe British example has shown how the E.U. is successful in creating interdependence,\u201d Zuleeg said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/maidan-massacre-anniversary-ukraine-remembers-bloody-day-protests-n973156", "text": "\u201cMaidan is still a place of pain for me,\u201d said Yevgen Nasadyuk, who was among the protesters there in 2014.\n\nNasadyuk, 33, initially showed his solidarity with the anti-government rallies in the capital by helping to launch demonstrations in the eastern city of Donetsk in November 2013.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Chagas disease, malaria and dengue can lead to death if not treated properly.\n\nZika virus infections could trigger other health complications such as nerve damages and spinal cord inflammations. During pregnancy, it could cause congenital abnormalities in a developing fetus.\n\nOnce one of the wealthiest nations in Latin America, Venezuela used to be a leader in public health efforts and in mosquito control programs \u2014 so much that in 1961 WHO certified it as the first country to eradicate malaria.\n\nAlmost six decades after this milestone, Venezuela finds itself wrestling with one of the largest malaria increases reported worldwide, according to the report.\n\nAn analysis of published and unpublished data shows that Venezuela saw an estimated 359 percent increase in malaria cases from 2010 to 2015. While nearly 30,000 malaria cases were reported in 2010, the number shot up to 136,402 in 2015 and 411,586 in 2017.\n\nIn some Venezuelan municipalities, \u201cmalaria incidence is likely to be linked with an increase in illegal mining activities and forest exploitation,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe incidence of dengue increased by more than four times from 1990 to 2016, according to the report. Similarly, the frequency of Zika outbreaks with epidemic potential appear to be increasing as experts found 2,057 cases of Zika virus per 100,000 people.\n\nThe prevalence of such diseases comes at a time when Venezuela is going through a crisis of historic proportions, with shortages in food, medicine and vaccinations. More Venezuelans are dying of preventable diseases and the country is seeing seven-digit inflation.\n\nThe report's authors mainly attributed the spike in cases to these living conditions, as well as a decline in mosquito-control activities known as vector control programs.\n\n\u201cThe health systems in Venezuela are in a very fragile state. Supplies, medicines, health infrastructures are lacking,\u201d Mario Grijalva, director of the Tropical Disease Institute at the University of Ohio and a co-author of the report, told NBC News. \u201cSo the logistics to treat these diseases are not working.\u201d\n\nGrijalva and other experts fear that the conditions in Venezuela could trigger a measles comeback, as well as other highly infectious diseases that could be prevented with vaccines.\n\nVenezuela already experienced a measles outbreak in 2017, a year after the WHO declared the Americas to be the first region in the world to essentially eradicate measles.\n\nAs of August of last year, Venezuela has reported 3,545 confirmed cases of measles, including 62 deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.\n\nDiseases spread in the region\n\nMeasles cases from other countries are still a main source of infection in places where the disease has largely been eliminated. Shortly after the measles outbreak in Venezuela, a dozen countries in the Americas \u2014 including Brazil, Colombia and Argentina \u2014 saw thousands of cases.\n\nAccording to WHO, measles outbreaks can be particularly deadly in countries experiencing conflict since damages to health infrastructure, interrupted health services, irregular immunization proceedings and residential overcrowding greatly increase the risk of infection.\n\nAt a time when more than 3 million people have fled Venezuela, mainly to Colombia, Brazil and other parts of South America, Grijalva said \u201ca call to action is the most important takeaway\u201d from the report.\n\n\u201cThe number of cases in these areas has gone up. Brazil and Colombia have astonishingly high numbers. But the issue is that in many of these countries, their public health capacity is on edge to the point that they can\u2019t serve their own needs,\u201d said Grijalva. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re raising the alarm.\u201d\n\nAmong the actions experts like Grijalva say could help combat the health crisis are making sure that humanitarian assistance gets to Venezuela and that neighboring countries attend to the needs of the Venezuelan refugee population.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/02/21/nike-sells-non-nfl-kaepernick-jerseys/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text", "text": "Nike\n\nThe NFL\u2019s official uniform supplier is supplying a football jersey that carries the colors and logos of no NFL teams.

The problem is that the way the Red Raiders defend \u2014 by icing ball-screens \u2014 is going to leave Northern Kentucky\u2019s best player, Drew McDonald, free for pick-and-pop threes the entire afternoon.\n\nPICK: Personally, I will likely be staying away from this line, but I do think that Texas Tech is the side that you want to be on.\n\n2:00 p.m.: No. 4 KANSAS STATE vs. No. 13 UC IRVINE, TBS\n\nLINE : Kansas State (-4.5)\n\n: Kansas State (-4.5) TOTAL : 118.5\n\n: 118.5 IMPLIED SCORE : Kansas State 61.5, UC Irvine 57\n\n: Kansas State 61.5, UC Irvine 57 KENPOM: Kansas State 62, UC Irvine 56\n\nThis changes if Dean Wade plays, but since he is currently listed as doubtful for this matchup, Kansas State is a team that is going to rely on penetration and the ability of their guards to get into the paint. The problem with that is that UC Irvine is a really good defensive team that actually leads the nation in defensive two-point field goal percentage. They have a couple of big uglies in the paint that can make things difficult for a Kansas State team that will be without their best shooter and one of their best passers.\n\nBeyond just the matchup, the Anteaters are really, really good and might be underseeded as a No. 13. With the Wildcats banged up, this is a matchup that Russell Turner can get the best of.\n\nPICK: I really like the Irvine side here, but the money line right now is just +170, so I\u2019ll probably take the points.\n\n2:45 p.m.: No. 2 TENNESSEE vs. No. 15 COLGATE, CBS\n\nLINE : Tennessee (-17.5)\n\n: Tennessee (-17.5) TOTAL : 147.5\n\n: 147.5 IMPLIED SCORE : Tennessee 82.5, Colgate 65\n\n: Tennessee 82.5, Colgate 65 KENPOM: Tennessee 83, Colgate 68\n\nI will be staying away fro this game.

Where the Sun Devils are inconsistent, Buffalo churned out a 30-win season that included going into West Virginia and Syracuse and getting Ws. Arizona State lost by 16 at Vanderbilt.\n\nPICK: I\u2019m taking the tougher team to win here even if it means betting against the more talented underdog. I just can\u2019t see C.J.

The question is going to be how Wisconsin goes about breaking down the zone Oregon will run, and while I do think that Ethan Happ can really pick it apart, it is important to note that the Ducks will be running out Kenny Wooten. He is as good of a defender as there is in the paint, and I would not be surprised to see him slow Happ down.\n\nAlso worth noting: The line is this game has moved from Wisconsin (-4) to Wisconsin (-1), then it bounced back up to Wisconsin (-3).\n\nPICK: I\u2019ll lean Oregon here, and I\u2019ll probably wait to see just how high this line will climb.

Think about this: The only reason that Washington has a win over an NCAA tournament team this season is because they lost to Oregon in the final of the Pac-12 tournament, giving the Ducks an automatic bid to the dance. Washington beat Oregon in January.\n\nPICK: Utah State has one of the most underappreciated players in the country on their roster in Sam Merrill. Craig Smith is a magnificent coach that will be at a bigger program soon. Take the Aggies.\n\n7:10 p.m.: No. 1 DUKE vs. No. 16 NORTH DAKOTA STATE, CBS\n\nLINE : Duke (-27)\n\n: Duke (-27) TOTAL : 148.5\n\n: 148.5 IMPLIED SCORE : Duke 87.75, NDSU 60.75\n\n: Duke 87.75, NDSU 60.75 KENPOM: Duke 87, NDSU 63\n\nThis spread is just so monstrous.

They aren\u2019t the best or most talented team in the country, but I do think that they are disciplined, well-coached and good enough defensively that they are not going to beat themselves.\n\nPICK: I\u2019ll take the Cougars (-11.5), but I won\u2019t feel all that comfortable about it.\n\n7:27 p.m.: No. 5 MISSISSIPPI STATE vs. No. 12 LIBERTY, 7:27 p.m. TruTV\n\nLINE : Mississippi State (-6.5)\n\n: Mississippi State (-6.5) TOTAL : 133.5\n\n: 133.5 IMPLIED SCORE : Mississippi State 70, Liberty 63.5\n\n: Mississippi State 70, Liberty 63.5 KENPOM: Mississippi State 71, Liberty 65\n\nThis is a tough game to get a feel for. For starters, Liberty was the second-best team in the Atlantic Sun this season, even if they did pick up a couple of wins against Lipscomb. They also run the Pack-Line defense, which is the kind of thing that can give the Bulldogs, who are without Nick Weatherspoon, some issues.\n\nThe problem here is that Mississippi State got dudes. Quinndary Weatherspoon, Reggie Perry, Aric Holman, Lamar Peters. These are guys that, which someone inconsistent, can absolutely take a game over, especially against a mid-major program.\n\nPICK: I\u2019d lean Mississippi State here, especially at just (-6.5), but I also think that the under is in play.\n\n9:20 p.m.: No. 1 NORTH CAROLINA vs. No. 16 IONA, 9:20 p.m. TNT\n\nLINE : North Carolina (-23.5)\n\n: North Carolina (-23.5) TOTAL : 166\n\n: 166 IMPLIED SCORE : North Carolina 94.75, Iona 71.25\n\n: North Carolina 94.75, Iona 71.25 KENPOM: North Carolina 95, Iowa 70\n\nI think that I am going to stay away from the line here. If I do bet it, I would be betting on the Tar Heels, mainly because this is a team that can put up 100 on anyone but also because I just don\u2019t think that Iona has the horses to be able to keep up with UNC this year. I also think that I like the under. 166 is a huge number, and while Iona has the reputation for being a team that wants to run, run, run and push, push, push, they are not as breakneck offensively as they have been in the past.\n\nPICK: I don\u2019t love either bet here, but if I am going to have action on this game, it will be UNC (-23.5) and the under.\n\n9:40 p.m.: No. 8 VCU vs. No. 9 UCF, 9:40 p.m. CBS\n\nLINE : VCU (-0.5)\n\n: VCU (-0.5) TOTAL : 126.5\n\n: 126.5 IMPLIED SCORE : VCU 63.5, UCF 63\n\n: VCU 63.5, UCF 63 KENPOM: VCU 63, UCF 62\n\nThis best is simple for me: UCF is a great defensive team that has an elite shot-blocker in the paint and wants to funnel drivers into the lane. VCU cannot shoot threes very well, they want to drive and their best player \u2014 Marcus Evans \u2014 will, at the very least, be banged up for this one.\n\nPICK: I like the UCF ML the play here if VCU is going to be favored. I also tend to lean towards the under. Both of these teams really, really defend, and while VCU is still going to try and force turnovers, they aren\u2019t pressing as much as they have in the past.\n\n9:50 p.m.: No. 6 IOWA STATE vs. No. 11 OHIO STATE, 9:50 p.m. TBS\n\nLINE : Iowa State (-5.5)\n\n: Iowa State (-5.5) TOTAL : 140.5\n\n: 140.5 IMPLIED SCORE : Iowa State 73, Ohio State 67.5\n\n: Iowa State 73, Ohio State 67.5 KENPOM: Iowa State 72, Ohio State 68\n\nThis line actually appears to be coming down. It opened at Iowa State (-6) and now sits at (-5.5), which is a dream come true for someone like me, that has the Cyclones in the Elite 8 despite decidedly not being back on the Iowa State bandwagon.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: Chris Holtmann is one of the top ten coaches in all of college basketball, but given the talent disparity between these two teams, if Iowa State shows up to play, they should be able to cover that spread regardless of how Holtmann decides to build his game-plan. The problem is that we can never really quite be sure if Iowa State is going to show up. The Cyclones looked like a top ten team in their run to the Big 12 tournament title. They looked like an NIT team when they lost six of their last eight games during the regular season.\n\nPICK: I think Iowa State has this figured out. I think they win with ease on Friday night.\n\n9:57 p.m.: No. 4 VIRGINIA TECH vs. No. 13 SAINT LOUIS, 9:57 p.m. TruTV\n\nLINE : Virginia Tech (-10.5)\n\n: Virginia Tech (-10.5) TOTAL : 125.5\n\n: 125.5 IMPLIED SCORE : Virginia Tech 68, Saint Louis 57.5\n\n: Virginia Tech 68, Saint Louis 57.5 KENPOM: Virginia Tech 69, Saint Louis 58\n\nThe key to betting this game is going to be how healthy you think Justin Robinson is. He is not their most talented player but he is their most important player. The Hokies were a top ten team with him healthy and went just 7-5 after he was injured on Jan. 30th. He matters because Saint Louis is a really, really talented and tough team that can absolutely lock up defensively. They have the athletes to be able to matchup with Virginia Tech\u2019s four-out, one-in scheme and while they have not been great offensively this year, I do think that they have the talent \u2014 Hasahn French, Jordan Goodwin, Javon Bess, Tramaine Isabell \u2014 to be able to makes plays when they need to.\n\nPICK: I will not be picking Saint Louis to win this game in my bracket, but at (+10.5), I do think they will cover. That is a big number for a good defensive team against a Virginia Tech that wants to play slow."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/syracuse-basketball-coach-jim-boeheim-fatally-strikes-man-interstate-his-n973996", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Both drivers passed field sobriety tests, officials said.\n\nSnow and freezing rain fell on Syracuse for much of Wednesday, and Syracuse police Chief Kenton Buckner said the wet weather was likely a factor in the Dodge Charger's crash.\n\n\"I believe that the weather and the conditions played some role,\" Buckner told reporters Thursday night. \"I believe that the victims' car hit some patch of ice.\"\n\nThe Charger was sitting perpendicular across the eastbound interstate, leaving just one open lane, police said.\n\nAnd to make matter worse, eastbound traffic was coming over a hill, giving drivers only a few moments to see the crashed vehicle on the darkened road, officials said.\n\nThe basketball coach pulled over and used the flash light function on his cellphone to warn oncoming drivers to the crash ahead, authorities said.\n\n\"Mr. Boeheim did exactly what we'd expect him to do,\" Buckner said. \"He was cooperative during our investigation both last night and today.\"\n\nBy early Thursday evening, Syracuse police had interviewed Boeheim and two of the three people from the Dodge, officials said.\n\nThe four people who were riding in the Dodge, between the ages of 49 and 58, did the right thing by getting out of the car, even if it led to one person dying, police said.\n\n\"I certainly understand their thought process which is if you remain in your vehicle in the middle of the roadway there's a strong likelihood you might be struck by another motor vehicle,\" said Syracuse police Lt. David Brown, a traffic investigator. \"What we want people to do is try to get to an area of safety.\"\n\nSo far, no one has been ticketed or charged with any crime, police said. The investigation is ongoing, and police asked for any witnesses to this crash to call police.\n\n\u201cAt this point ... it appears to be just a God-awful tragedy,\u201d said Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday morning, Boeheim said he and his wife, Juli, are mourning Jimenez's death.\n\n\"I am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night's accident,\" Boeheim said. \"Juli and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family. Out of respect for those involved, I will not be providing further comment at this time.\"\n\nJimenez, an immigrant from Cuba, was out with friends to buy cigarettes when he was killed, his daughter Yurisandy Jimenez Arrastre told the Post-Standard newspaper.\n\n\u201cMy father was a man who was very sociable, very happy. He loved to help everybody without question,\u201d Arrastre told the newspaper in Spanish.\n\nHours before the deadly crash, Boeheim's team defeated Louisville, 69-49, at the Carrier Dome. He went out to dinner with family after the game and was driving home alone when the accident happened, according to Fitzpatrick.\n\nThe team's next game, Saturday against No. 1 Duke, is also at home.\n\n\"We are saddened by the death of a member of our Central New York community. On behalf of Chancellor Kent Syverud and the entire Syracuse University community, we extend our deepest condolences to all impacted by this tragic accident\" Syracuse Athletic Director John Wildhack said in a statement.\n\nBoeheim, who is in the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, has been at Syracuse for 43 years and has a career record of 944-378.

I feel good about it.\u201d\n\nGame on!\n\n@BenNugentt When Boogie gets back in a few days, do you think Andrew Bogut will play Kevon Looney\u2019s minutes or what\u2019s going to happen there?\n\n@amar_srinivas1 What's andrew bogut's rotation/minutes going to look like when demarcus is back? #askKerith\n\n@GSDOUBLEU Do you foresee Bogut getting starts over Cousins depending on the matchup of the particular game?\n\nLots of Boogie-Bogut-Looney questions coming in this week. Understandable considering Bogut is a new (old!) piece that shakes things up.\n\nTo recap, DeMarcus Cousins missed two games on the road with a sore right ankle/foot. There are no long-term concerns.\n\nBogut started the games Cousins missed and played 19 minutes and 13 minutes, respectively. Bogut\u2019s minutes will depend on matchups. Cousins is the starter. Looney is the next big to rotate in. Bogut is the insurance policy. His minutes will fluctuate. Some nights, Bogut won\u2019t play at all.\n\nDepending on matchups in the rest of the regular season, Bogut or Looney could start for Cousins on rest nights, such as the second games of back-to-backs. In the playoffs, I think it would take a special situation for one of them to start in place of Cousins. The Warriors would need a major shake-up in that event, but don\u2019t rule it out.\n\nVia IG: @jenniferespinolaa Why doesn\u2019t Jerebko get more playing time? #askKerith\n\nJennifer asked this before Jerebko had 18 points in 18 minutes against Minnesota. But this question has come up frequently, as fans are noticing his playing time is down, including several DNPs.\n\nI actually asked Steve Kerr about Jerebko before the Minnesota game, because Bogut\u2019s presence adds a new wrinkle.\n\nHere\u2019s what Kerr said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough for Jonas. He played a very important role for us the first half of the season and then when DeMarcus came back, the ripple effect hurt Jonas the most because DeMarcus is going to give us 30 minutes a night at the five which means the minutes that we have at the four are more limited. Jonas has been the odd man out, but he\u2019s a pro. He stays ready, gets his work in and he\u2019s been through this before. We\u2019ve talked, and he\u2019s frustrated, but he understands. He\u2019s just got to stay ready. In this league, you just never know.\u201d\n\n@ACook05 Do the Warriors have any plans to make roster additions prior to the playoffs?\n\nBogut is player No. 15 on the roster, the final spot. It\u2019s possible the Warriors could sign Damion Lee for the playoffs. To find a spot for Lee, the Warriors would have to waive Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, or Jerebko. They have until the end of the regular season to decide.\n\n@CthulhusProdigy How do they continue to stay hungry in year 5 of this dynasty???\n\nThat\u2019s the big question. Making the Finals for a fifth consecutive season would deepen the dynasty. And accomplishing a three-peat would be a rare mark in NBA history, alongside only the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls.\n\nEvery team is hungry for a championship. There\u2019s built-in motivation, but the Warriors have the talent to do it. This roster, this moment in time, is only here for so long. There\u2019s an urgency to seize the moment. A three-peat has been the singular goal all season. It\u2019s their rock and nothing else matters.\n\n@dubsandstuff Do players watch a lot of other games or are they basketball-ed out during the season?\n\nSteve Kerr says he watches League Pass frequently. At team dinners, games around the league are on TV, but how invested guys are in watching the games varies.\n\nNBA players know plenty of guys on other teams. They want to see how their friends are doing. They also keep an eye on the competition. If you\u2019re in the league, you\u2019re obviously a fan of the game. It can be hard to turn games off when you\u2019ve devoted so much of your time to it.\n\nOther guys say they want a separation between what they\u2019re doing and what other teams are doing. They want tunnel vision on their team only. So the answer to your question depends on who you ask and what mood they\u2019re in.\n\n@CrushonIvy Are you into March madness? Who is your pick to win it all and why? #askKerith\n\nI used to be into the NCAA men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments much more when I was covering college basketball. March Madness is a fun time of year but I\u2019m barely aware of who is good this year beyond Duke and Carolina on the men\u2019s side.\n\nIn my bracket, I\u2019m playing it safe. Few upsets. On the strength of Zion Williamson alone, I\u2019m picking Duke to win. That should make Quinn Cook happy.\n\nSpeaking of Cook, check out the latest Road Trippin' podcast where I talk with him and former Duke teammate Austin Rivers about Coach K, the Steph Curry effect, and the best road cities in the NBA.\n\n@eastbaykillas #AskKerith who selects what jerseys teams wear? Is there a jersey schedule available? Just curious as Dubs haven\u2019t worn white at home since November. Thanks!\n\nHere\u2019s the uniform schedule for the league.\n\nThe home team decides what uniform they want to wear, in part with the team\u2019s marketing department.\n\n@LookItAmy Who holds the title as best golfer on the Warriors? #askKerith\n\nThis question made me smile, and I consulted a Warriors staff member who is in the know.\n\nHe ordered team golfers like so: Steph Curry, Jonnie West, Steve Kerr, Andre Iguodala, Willie Green, Klay Thompson, and Jarron Collins.\n\nSteph is really good\u2026.like if he devoted himself to golf instead of basketball, he could probably get his tour card. And Jonnie is good too. I was at an event where he caddied for Steph. He trusts Jonnie\u2019s advice.\n\nThis reminds me .... Congratulations to Jonnie for his engagement to LPGA Tour champion Michelle Wie!\n\nHigh Five\n\nThis week\u2019s high five goes to Kevin \u201cPizza Delivery Man\u201d Durant. How cool was it for him to talk to a dad in an elevator, and then go up to the dad\u2019s room with pizza for his sons? That\u2019s the ultimate surprise from a player who goes out of his way to do nice things for kids."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2019/02/20/mlb-to-crack-down-on-sign-stealing/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text", "text": "We\u2019ve had a couple of notable incidents of sign stealing in Major League Baseball over the past couple of years. Most famously, the Red Sox were found to be using Apple Watches of all things to relay signs spied via video feed. Sports Illustrated reported yesterday that there have been other less-publicized and unpublicized incidents as well, mostly with in-house TV cameras \u2014 as opposed to network TV cameras \u2014 stationed in the outfield and trained on catchers, for the specific purpose of stealing signs.\n\nAs such, SI reports, Major League Baseball is cracking down beginning this year. Within the next couple weeks an already-drafted and circulated rule will take effect which will (a) ban in-house outfield cameras from foul pole to foul pole; (b) will limit live broadcasts available to teams to the team\u2019s replay official only, and the replay official will be watched by a league official to keep them from relaying signs to the team; and (c) other TV monitors that are available to the clubs will be on an eight-second delay to prevent real-time sign stealing. There will likewise be limits on TV monitors showing the game feed in certain places like tunnels and clubhouses.\n\nPenalties for violation of the rules will include the forfeiting of draft picks and/or international spending money. General managers will have to sign a document in which they swear they know of know sign-stealing schemes.\n\nAs was the case when the Apple Watch incident came up, there will not be any new rules regarding old fashioned sign stealing by runners on second base or what have you, as that is viewed as part of the game. Only the technology-aided sign stealing that has become more prominent in recent years \u2014 but which has, of course, existed in other forms for a very, very long time \u2014 is subject to the crackdown.\n\nWhile gamesmanship of one form or another has always been part of baseball, the current wave of sign-stealing is seen as a pace-of-play issue just as much as a fairness issue. Because of the actual sign-stealing \u2014 and because of paranoia that any opponent could be stealing signs \u2014 clubs have gone to far more elaborate and constantly changing sign protocols. This requires mound meetings and pitchers coming off the rubber in order to re-start the increasingly complex series of signs from dugout to catcher and from catcher to pitcher.\n\nNow, presumably, with these new rules coming online, teams will figure out a new way to cheat. It\u2019s baseball, after all.

At least that's the theory behind corporations loading up their CEOs with stock or, as the experts put it, \"aligning CEO and shareholder interests.\"\n\nBut a new study from researchers at the University of Georgia, the University of Notre Dame, and Lehigh University shows that sometimes the opposite is true.\n\nStock options give someone the right to buy a certain number of shares at the price of the day the options are granted, respectively called the strike price and the strike date. If share values rise, so does the value of the options, even if the person hasn't yet bought the stock.\n\nThe release of negative news can mean extra money \u2014 frequently hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 for a CEO with stock options coming due.\n\nAn example is the options backdating scandal of the mid-2000s, when researchers such as Erik Lie of the University of Iowa found that thousands of companies dated options as though they were given before they actually were, choosing a time when share prices were particularly low. That boosted the value for the executives receiving them. Such a move is legal if done properly, including informing investors. Often it wasn't.\n\nThe new options twist\n\nThe new study shows a twist in options shenanigans: Many companies distribute optional press releases with a negative tone that drive down the share price around the option strike date. Then the price returns to a more normal level, netting the CEOs of the companies a hefty return.\n\nResearchers looked at 460 CEOs of large, publicly traded U.S. companies. Each had at least two different option strike dates from 2009 and 2013, which meant that if effects were random in nature, they should more or less cancel out.\n\nThe results were comparable to those from the backdating scandals. \"There was a 2 percent dip in the stock price \u2014 and 30 [trading] days after, it was a 2 percent or more rise in the price,\" Timothy Hubbard, assistant professor of management at Notre Dame, told NBC News.\n\nThe effect was like the letter \"V,\" where the stock price dropped down until it reached the strike date \u2014 when the price of the options for a CEO was fixed \u2014 and then went back to normal within a month. The timing of the price swings meant CEOs made between $143,500 and $839,000.\n\n\"We found 11 percent of [examined] CEOs checked that box,\" Hubbard said. \"It's also scary that [CEOs] have that much ability. We tested this with non-CEO grants and didn't find it at all.\"\n\nWhen bad news is good\n\nThe mechanism to affect share prices was negative press releases. The researchers examined more than 49,000 press releases issued by the associated companies roughly six weeks before the option grant dates to see whether the language with more positive or negative.\n\nThe releases with the most effect were ones that had more negative language, even if they read as \"relatively innocuous,\" according to Hubbard. Additionally, they weren't the types of communications that are mandatory under regulations, like a release describing earnings or an acquisition.\n\nAlso, the CEOs under whom such tactics occurred were underpaid relative to other chief executives. \"I would wager they're acutely aware of what they make compared to their peers,\" Hubbard said.\n\n\"Boy, it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, just like the backdating scandal,\" said Nell Minow, an expert in corporate governance, and the vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, which helps institutional investors. \"We should have learned from that. If executives can't skew the numbers to their advantage by picking the date of the award, they will do it by picking the timing and content of the information released to investors.\"\n\nMinow suggested as a potential cure the use of indexed stock options, which can only be exercised if the shares do better than some common stock index, like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500.\n\nHubbard suggested giving options at frequent intervals, like every month rather than once or twice a year, because it would become virtually impossible to manipulate results that often."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/johnson-johnson-facing-new-federal-investigations-over-reported-link-between-its-baby-powder-and-asbestos-1446402115732", "text": "Johnson & Johnson facing new federal investigations over reported link between its baby powder and asbestos 01:21 copied!\n\nThe Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and a Senate committee are looking into whether its talcum baby powders are linked to cancer-causing asbestos \u2013 a link the company has vehemently denied.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/nike-shares-slip-heels-zion-williamson-sneaker-malfunction-n973971", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It\u2019s been going on for approximately four decades.\n\n\u201cIt seems dumb and it is dumb, but we have had some rough meltdowns about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWithin 20 minutes of our first meeting we were arguing about it \u2014 although it was \u2018cute\u2019 and \u2018flirtatious\u2019 that first time \u2014 and I have no doubt that on our last days, if we are still standing, we will continue to be annoyed at the \u2018wrong way\u2019 our partner does it.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Carroll has learned how to quickly nip what used to be hours-long fits over this, and similar issues. How? By ditching what she calls \u201crighteous indignation\u201d and taking the argument at face value.\n\n\u201cResearch shows that the majority of issues between couples don't change. What does change is how we manage them,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know how to let it go, to laugh at ourselves, to repair any damage and to move on \u2014 lovingly.\u201d\n\nJumping to Conclusions\n\nJohn Kim, author of \"I Used to Be a Miserable F*ck\", isn\u2019t your traditional therapist. He runs a blog called The Angry Therapist (which was prompted by his own painful divorce) and has no problem telling anyone that therapists have imperfect relationships, too. He tells us that his most pressing relationship stressors have to do with his own fears and insecurities.\n\n\u201cThe cognitive distortion I struggle with the most is jumping to conclusions. I assume before knowing any facts. I think something is true just because I feel instead of knowing what is real,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be aware all my own [baggage], fears, insecurities and cognitive distortions, and to communicate them to my partner so we are doing life with each other instead of around [each other].\u201d\n\nHe says that taking ownership over these fears requires constant surveillance of his own emotions and also the assistance of his own therapist.\n\n\u201cYou stop jumping to conclusions first by being aware of when you may be doing it. You have to talk yourself off the ledge before you do something in action that you will regret. Know that it's your mind spinning and not the truth. Know that feelings are not facts,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce you can question your thoughts and thinking and don't allow yourself to go there, you can start to feel and believe something different. The more you practice this, the easier it will get.\u201d\n\nStruggling to Communicate Openly\n\nHaving difficult conversations with anyone often breeds stress, discomfort and sometimes even fear \u2014 to the point that you think maybe it\u2019s easier to just ... not. Hannah Orenstein, senior dating editor at Elite Daily and author of \"Playing With Matches\", admits it\u2019s a struggle for her, especially when the potential for disagreement is high.\n\nOrenstein and her boyfriend.\n\n\u201cI've learned that it's so much better to speak up even if it feels uncomfortable in the moment. [Doing so] can smooth over potential conflicts before they even arise,\u201d she says. \u201cOur first fight was over a really trivial miscommunication about what time we should meet up for plans. He didn't specifically tell me his schedule and I made assumptions without asking him first. If we had both been clearer and more communicative, we could've avoided that completely. Now, we both make speaking up and staying in touch a priority no matter how big or small the situation.\u201d\n\nDisplacing Work and Life Stress onto Your Partner\n\nDr. Paul L. Hokemeyer is an internationally-recognized psychotherapist who works with couples and families across the globe to overcome complex relationship issues. His work takes him all over the world, which means he\u2019s constantly in a state of perpetual motion and personal stress.\n\n\u201cAs a result, I often feel ungrounded and uncentered, which amplifies my professional-related stress. When these feelings become acute, I tend to point the finger at my spouse and place the blame on them for my uncomfortable feelings,\u201d he says. \u201cFortunately, I've had enough training to know that these are what are known in the field as \u2018displaced feelings.\u2019 Yes, I can be angry and uncomfortable, but I need to own these feelings, take responsibility for them, and work to resolve them.\u201d\n\nDr. Hokemeyer says that relationships that endure the test of time, and the inevitable stressors of life, must remain grounded in a daily commitment to stay in the relationship and a conscious effort to communicate gratitude and respect for your partner.\n\n\u201cFor the last 25 years, I have had a daily ritual of spending the first 20 minutes of the day with a cup of coffee and a journal writing out my flow of consciousness for that particular morning,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of this brain dump, I set out five intentions for the day. At the top of the list are to appreciate my spouse and to be of service to the world.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, find comfort in knowing that no relationship is perfect, not even those of the experts that we turn to for advice. Wherever you\u2019re at in your relationship and no matter what sort of stressors you battle, it\u2019s important to recognize what issues you\u2019re bringing to the table, to be completely open with your significant other, and sometimes, to laugh it off.\n\nMORE RELATIONSHIP ADVICE\n\nWant more tips like these?

By the age of three, most pets show signs of periodontal disease, which will only get worse as they grow older, if preventive measures aren\u2019t taken. Without treatment, the gums will eventually recede, and the teeth will become loose. Some may fall out or need to be extracted.\n\nNote: Small dogs are more likely to have dental problems than larger breeds.\n\nThe AVMA says dogs and cats should have a veterinary dental cleaning annually starting at age two, or sooner if you observe any of the following problems:\n\nbad breath\n\nbroken or loose teeth\n\nextra teeth or retained baby teeth\n\nteeth that are discolored or covered in tartar\n\nabnormal chewing, drooling, or dropping food from the mouth\n\nreduced appetite or refusal to eat\n\npain in or around the mouth\n\nbleeding from the mouth\n\nswelling in the areas surrounding the mouth\n\nSHOULD YOU WORRY ABOUT HAVING YOUR DOG OR CAT ANESTHETIZED?\n\nSince your pet probably won\u2019t sit still and can\u2019t \u201copen real wide,\u201d they\u2019ll need to be anesthetized for a complete dental exam and cleaning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty limited in what we can evaluate with a pet that\u2019s fully awake and a lot of dental diseases hide under the gum line,\u201d said Dr. Jason Nicholas, president and chief medical officer of PreventiveVet.com. \u201cWithout anesthesia, you can\u2019t probe along the gum line and it\u2019s physically impossible to take dental X-rays, which are vitally important to fully evaluate the health of the oral cavity.\u201d\n\nSome pet parents skip full dental checkups to avoid having their dog or cat anesthetized, even though the risk of complications is extremely low.\n\n\u201cI know that putting a patient under anesthesia can be a little bit scary, but most veterinarians are incredibly careful and very thoughtful about when to put their patients under,\u201d said Nadine Fiani, an assistant clinical professor at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cWe do an extensive amount of care prior to putting them under anesthesia \u2014 we check blood work, we make sure their heart is okay. And we monitor them during the procedure.\u201d\n\nDr. Heidi Shafford, a board-certified veterinary anesthesiologist who practices in Portland, Ore., urges people to check with their vet to make sure someone is assigned to monitor their pet during the procedure.\n\n\u201cAt many clinics, the person who's doing the procedure is also \u2018monitoring\u2019 anesthesia and they really need to have one person dedicated to monitoring anesthesia and one person focused on the procedure,\u201d Shafford said. \u201cThis is not yet common, but it makes a big difference.\u201d\n\nSome vets, pet stores and groomers offer what\u2019s called \u201canesthesia free dental cleanings.\u201d The procedure involves scaling the teeth, scaping with an instrument, without using anesthesia. To do this, your pet is physically restrained.\n\nThe AVMA says this scraping and restraining can be highly stressful and \u201ccould cause a great deal of discomfort and pain to your pet.\u201d\n\nThe AVMA also cautions: Anesthesia free dental procedures \u201care not able to clean beneath the gumline to prevent periodontal disease, nor are they able to look beneath the gum-line to identify problems before they become painful and expensive to treat. White teeth do not mean a clean and healthy mouth.\u201d\n\nPUTTING OFF THE INEVITABLE\n\nDelaying proper treatment can result in prolonged discomfort for your pet and serious dental problems that are more difficult and costlier to treat.\n\n\u201cYou either pay something every year to try to maintain their teeth or you end up dropping a whole lot later to remove a bunch of teeth all at once, if they\u2019ve gotten really bad,\u201d said Dr. Colleen Cassidy at veterinarian at Rainier Veterinary Hospital near Seattle.\n\nAdam Scheurich, who took Levi, his 13-year-old Chihuahua mix, to Dr. Cassidy recently, put off full oral exams because of his concern about anesthesia. Scheurich now realizes he waited too long. Dr. Cassidy had to remove several teeth that were loose and causing Levi pain.\n\n\u201cLevi now feels so much better. He\u2019s more energetic, running around a lot more and acting a lot younger,\u201d Scheurich told NBC News BETTER. \u201cLooking back, we should have done something sooner.\u201d\n\nAlthough the cost of a full dental checkup and cleaning varies from vet to vet and city to city, expect to pay somewhere between $250 and $500 or so. The final bill will be significantly higher should teeth need to extracted.\n\nNOTE: If cost is a concern, talk to your vet about ways to lower the costs. There may be treatment options.\n\nTHINGS YOU CAN DO AT HOME\n\nRegularly brushing your pet\u2019s teeth is the single most effective thing can do to keep your pet\u2019s teeth healthy between dental cleanings by your veterinarian. The AVMA says it may even reduce the frequency of those professional cleanings.\n\nDaily brushing is the goal, but even a few days a week can significantly reduce plaque buildup.\n\nYes, it can be a real challenge, especially with a cat. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to start when your pets are young \u2014 even if they still have their baby teeth \u2014 so they get accustomed to having this done.\n\nTry a flavored pet toothpaste and give it to them as a treat. After a few weeks, you can start brushing with it. Warning: Do not use human toothpaste. Pet toothpaste is made to be swallowed.\n\nOther products for home use:\n\nChew treats designed to clean teeth.\n\nDental foods that provide better cleaning action.\n\nAnti-plaque water additive, oral gel or oral spray.\n\nNOTE: Do not use antlers. Elk, deer and reindeer antlers are all the rage right now, but they can break your dog\u2019s teeth or cause puncture wounds.\n\nTalk to you vet about which products might be right for your pet and choose products with the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) seal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that these are really helpful tools that can slow down the rate of periodontal disease, but they won\u2019t cure it.\u201d said Cornell\u2019s Fiani. \u201cIt\u2019s a chronic, ongoing issue that has to be managed for the rest of your pet\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM BETTER\n\nWant more tips like these?

Would that change how you approach the things that you can get done?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how to say \u201cyes\u201d to the right things and \u201cno\u201d to everything else, according to Kleeberger.\n\nStop juggling\n\nWhen you\u2019re busy, you\u2019re juggling multiple things at once, explains Kleeberger \u2014 throwing family, work and hobbies from one hand to the next.\n\nTyler Kleeberger prioritizes his family and community when saying \"yes\" to things. Vanessa Kleeberger\n\n\u201cIn that process, you never actually get to invest yourself into the thing you\u2019re holding, because you don\u2019t hold it for long enough,\u201d he says. You\u2019re not saying 'yes' to any of those things, he explains, you\u2019re just saying 'no' to all of them.\n\nKleeberger, 29, balances working full time as executive director of The FarmHouse (a church and nonprofit that focuses on improving community health in Metamora, Ohio), being a father to two young children, and coaching high school football.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a father, and I\u2019m a provider, and those things I can hold,\u201d he says, \u201cand so I want to focus on being a good parent, I want to focus on being a good father, a good lover to my spouse, and I want to focus on being a good provider at the job that I do.\u201d\n\nIf he tried to add more, he says, he would end up sacrificing one of those cherished things.\n\nUse your standard to decide when to say \"yes\"\n\nThe easiest way to know whether to say \u201cyes\u201d to something is to know your standard, says Kleeberger \u2014 something that is personally important to you, whether it\u2019s health, love, success or something else.\n\nHe compares it to the \u201ctwo-thirds\u201d rule, a rule generally used by business owners to decide what they\u2019re going to prioritize and what they are going to sacrifice to be successful.\n\nFor example, if a high-end restaurant owner wants to prioritize the quality of her food, she understands she needs to sacrifice time and price (the food will be made more slowly and will cost more money) to ensure customers get a high quality product, according to Kleeberger.\n\nKleeberger says individuals can use the two-thirds rule, too.\n\nFirst, he says you have to figure out what your standard is \u2014 what do you prioritize in life above all else? Kleeberger says the standard he prioritizes is health \u2014 not simply being physically healthy, he explains, but also maintaining his psychological health through relationship and community building.\n\nWhen he decided to say \u201cyes\u201d to becoming a football coach at a high school in Metamora, where he lives, it was with that standard in mind, he says.\n\n\u201cI do it because of the connection it gives me to the community and to young people in the community,\u201d he explains.\n\nHe says that the rule also comes into play when it comes to his profession and where he lives. \"Because I want to write and do community work, I had to say no to other professions. I considered the restaurant world but had to let go of that dream (though it may one day be able to become a yes). There have been business opportunities that I\u2019ve had to turn down,\" he says. \"Another example is that I have said yes to the rural community in which I live and have had to say 'no' to job offers that would allow me to continue to do the same work but would require me to move. I could long distance commute, but I\u2019ve said yes to a flexible schedule and family investment. Because of those yes categories, the job offers are an easy no.\"\n\nWhen to say \u201cno\u201d\n\nWhen you know what you\u2019re only going to say \u201cyes\u201d to, Kleeberger says, saying \u201cno\u201d is easy.\n\nOnce you have your standards for your life of what you\u2019re going to pursue, it becomes kind of blatantly obvious what you can\u2019t do anymore.\n\n\u201cOnce you have your standards for your life of what you\u2019re going to pursue, it becomes kind of blatantly obvious what you can\u2019t do anymore,\u201d he says. \"I often say no to meetings if they don\u2019t fit my immediate goal/plan/action categories. I say no to a lot of suggestions from people on what I should read or what event I should do. I decline invitations to events if they don\u2019t fit my current categories. There are many daily decisions where I go, 'I have this much time and this much energy. Therefore, these are the things that fit and anything else is out.'\"\n\nBut it\u2019s okay if the things you say \u201cyes\u201d to now become things you say \u201cno\u201d to later, he says.\n\n\u201cAt some point, that could change, and if I\u2019m sensing that I\u2019m no longer able to bring that value to the community, or I find something else that is allowing me to do that, at that point I can go, \u2018I need to say \u2018no\u2019 to that,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nHave a plan\n\nOnce you say \u201cyes\u201d to something, Kleeberger advises, you need to take action.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not being intentional about these things, you\u2019re going to drift towards whatever is easiest,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a good chance that those will not coincide, and will directly conflict, with what you said you were trying to pursue.\u201d\n\nYour saying \"no\" action plan\n\nStop juggling too many commitments: When you juggle too many things at once, you never really focus on anything.\n\nIdentify your standard and live by it: What do you value most? Health, family, creativity, success? Once you know your value and stick to it, knowing what to say \u201cyes\u201d to \u2014 and what you must sacrifice \u2014 is obvious.\n\nKnow when to say \u201cno\u201d: Using your standards as a guide, if it\u2019s not a definitive \u201cyes,\u201d then it\u2019s a \u201cno.\u201d\n\nHave a plan of attack: Don\u2019t simply say \u201cyes\u201d to something \u2014 take action and be intentional about how you will carry it out.\n\nMORE WORK AND PRODUCTIVITY HACKS\n\nWant more tips like these?

But here\u2019s the good news: When you\u2019re equipped with the right tools, products, and know-how, the entire process is actually pretty simple.\n\nAccording to nutrition and wellness experts, meal prep will make your life a whole lot easier \u2014 and healthier \u2014 in the long run. \u201cWhen you take time to prep your meals, you\u2019ll save money, time, and make smarter choices in a pinch,\u201d explains Keri Glassman, MS, RD, founder of Nutritious Life. \u201cBy committing to just an hour of meal prep at the beginning of your week, you can actually lessen the total amount of cooking you have to do over the course of a busy week.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re new to meal prepping, here\u2019s the gist of what\u2019s involved.\n\nPick a day and time that works for you. It could be Sunday, but maybe Monday or even Saturday works better for your schedule. \u201cI usually go food shopping on Saturdays when stores are less crowded and then I focus my Sunday on cooking,\u201d says Tracy Lockwood Beckerman, RD, in-house nutritionist at Betches Media. \u201cI\u2019ll cook my grains, roast my veggies on a sheet pan and grill my proteins on Sunday morning.\u201d Plus, if you\u2019ve ever suffered a \u201ccase of the Mondays,\u201d you know the best thing is coming home to a meal that\u2019s already been prepped on Monday, as Beckerman notes. Get the right products \u2014 and make room in your fridge. You\u2019ll need glass containers of various shapes and sizes, Glassman says. (Scroll down for her and other nutritionists\u2019 top picks!) Plus, you\u2019ll want to take some time to organize your fridge so you have space for a week\u2019s worth of foods, she adds. Consider it more \u2018mix-and-match\u2019 than \u2018meal planning.\u2019 \u201cAt its core, meal prep is all about cooking in bulk and eating the leftovers,\u201d Glassman explains. Beckerman likes to prep meal components that she can combine in different ways throughout the week for freedom and variety, rather than create complete pre-prepped meals. She preps grains (think: quinoa, brown rice, oats), roasted veggies, a large batch of seared or roasted protein (such as chicken, tofu, or salmon), washed and chopped raw veggies, and a dressing or hummus. \u201cThis strategy allows you to mix and match throughout the week,\u201d Beckerman explains. \u201cOne day you can top greens with just roasted veggies if in the mood for a lighter meal, or a heftier grain bowl the next.\u201d Think three days in advance. \u201cI encourage my clients not to get caught up with having to plan the entire five- or seven-day week ahead,\u201d says Kelly LeVeque, certified holistic nutritionist and author of Body Love. \u201cIt's more flexible and less overwhelming to think ahead for three-day blocks.\u201d After all, for many of us, it's not realistic to decide what you're going to want to eat by Thursday or Friday on a Sunday. It\u2019s all about balance. The key to making your pre-prepped meals ultra-satisfying: Make sure that each contains a protein, carbohydrate, and fat to keep you satiated after the meal, Beckerman notes. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to add a ton of vegetables, fresh or frozen, to give you a boost of antioxidants and belly filling fiber!\u201d Don\u2019t skip the staples. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave the grocery store without B.A.G.E.L.S \u2014 that\u2019s my acronym for berries, avocado, greek yogurt, eggs, lettuce and scallions,\u201d Beckerman says. \u201cThese are staples in my house and I\u2019ll find a use for them in my cooking throughout the week, no matter what.\u201d These whole foods make a great choice for a grab-and-go snack, or they help add flavor and variety to many meals.\n\nThe best lunch boxes and meal prep containers\n\nReady to get started?

With help from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have confirmed the existence of this tiny moon in orbit around Neptune.\n\nThe newly characterized moon \u2014 named after a mythical half-horse, half-fish sea creature \u2014 is the smallest moon yet discovered in orbit around the outermost planet. NASA says the 20-mile-wide moon is about 100 million times fainter than the faintest star that's visible to the naked eye.\n\nHippocamp was first seen in photos taken by Hubble in 2013. But its presence \u2014 situated close to a much larger moon known as Proteus \u2014 posed a mystery: Why hadn't Hippocamp coalesced with or been cast aside by Proteus, an irregularly shaped, 260-mile-wide moon that is roughly 1,000 times more massive?\n\nSome called S/2004 N1, as Hippocamp was originally known, \"the moon that shouldn't be there.\"\n\nBut after several years of sleuthing \u2014 including a fresh look at photos of the Neptune system taken by Hubble and NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft \u2014 astronomers led by Mark Showalter of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, determined that Hippocamp is a piece of Proteus that had been sheared off from the larger moon when a comet struck it billions of years ago.\n\nThere's no smoking gun for a collision so ancient. But as Showalter and his colleagues say in a paper about their research, published Thursday in the journal Nature, a large impact crater consistent with a comet strike can be seen in photos of Proteus taken in 1989 by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft.\n\n\"The origin scenario we discussed in the paper is consistent with everything we know about the history of the Neptune system,\" Showalter told NBC News MACH in an email. \"It is the only workable scenario that we have identified. On the other hand, if somebody else in the astronomy community comes up with an alternative explanation, we would love to hear about it.\"\n\nIt's a big backstory for such a puny moon, but other astronomers agree it's probably the correct one.\n\nSara Seager, a planetary scientist at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said in an email that the explanation made sense. She called it \u201ca fascinating hypothesis for the tiny moon\u2019s origin \u2014 with solid support from Hubble data gathered over the last few years.\"\n\nThis diagram shows the orbits of several moons close to the planet Neptune. All were discovered in 1989 by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft, with the exception of Hippocamp (S/2004 N 1). It was discovered in archival Hubble Space Telescope images taken from 2004 to 2009. NASA / ESA/A. Feild (STScI)\n\nHundreds of moons have been found in our solar system. But the Proteus-Hippocamp pair \"provides a dramatic illustration that moons are sometimes broken apart by comets,\" Jack Lissauer, a scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, and a coauthor of the paper, said in a written statement.\n\nThe discovery of Hippocamp brings to 14 the number of moons discovered in orbit around Neptune. There are seven inner moons, including Hippocamp, along with six outer moons and Neptune's largest moon, Triton.\n\nTriton is a bit of an oddball because it's the only large moon in the solar system with a so-called retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in the opposite direction of its planet's rotation.\n\nShowalter said that we've learned just about all we can about Hippocamp, at least for the time being. But he added that if NASA or the European Space Agency were to put a spacecraft in orbit around Neptune or its planetary neighbor, Uranus, \"we could learn more in a few days that the sum total of everything we have ever learned about either planet so far!\"\n\nWant more stories about space?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/mood-forecasting-tech-could-help-stop-bad-moods-even-they-ncna973241", "text": "Get the Mach newsletter.\n\nFeb. 19, 2019, 10:22 PM GMT By Jessica Wapner\n\nImagine an app or wearable device that could tell a day in advance that an at-risk individual would experience suicidal thoughts \u2014 and alert the person and their trusted contacts. That might soon be a reality, thanks to the nascent field of mood forecasting.\n\nWe've become used to fitness trackers and other electronic devices that monitor our physical activity, and now scientists say similar technology can be used to track our psychological health in ways never before possible.\n\nBy spotting early signs of emotional distress, the new apps and wearables could soon help preserve our mental well-being.\n\n\u201cWe rely on patients to tell us how they feel, and we are beholden to that in making our decisions,\u201d says Ipsit Vahia, a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. But because it isn\u2019t subject to the vagaries of our mood and our ability to assess our psychological state, technology could give doctors more reliable information.\n\nExploiting mind-body links\n\nMood forecasting exploits the connection between the mind and the body. Research has shown that changes in our mental state, including bouts of sadness or anxiety, affect our bodies in discernible ways.\n\nThe heart rate is the best known of these emotional biomarkers \u2014 our pulse tends to quicken when we\u2019re stressed. But our bodies respond to emotional distress in other ways too. \u201cWe know that reduced movement and sleep are markers of depression,\u201d Vahia says. Perspiration increases with stress. And skin temperature often rises with what Harvard psychologist Matthew Nock calls \u201cemotional arousal.\"\n\nAt least theoretically, any wearable that has sensors for pulse, skin temperature and movement can help track our mood. But even something as simple as the way we use our smartphones can reveal useful information about our mental state.\n\nThe pace at which we text, call and post on social media are all markers of what experts call our \u201cdigital phenotype.\u201d And these markers change with our moods \u2014 posting more photos when we\u2019re happy, for example, or posting fewer when we\u2019re feeling blue.\n\nAs Sharath Guntuku, a research scientist at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Digital Health in Philadelphia, puts it, \u201cBased on how we use technology, our mental state can be predicted.\"\n\nDetecting and interpreting biomarkers\n\nTo exploit all this valuable data, academic researchers and private companies are working to develop devices and programs that not only detect and interpret our biomarkers but also respond with helpful advice.\n\nFor example, a mood-forecasting device or app might urge someone to call a friend when they have cut back on texting, or take a walk when the device hasn\u2019t registered motion for several hours. Alternatively, shifting biomarkers or digital behavior could be communicated directly to an individual\u2019s doctor, who could then intervene as necessary.\n\n\u201cBy making these microadjustments day by day, maybe you would stop sliding toward depression and bounce back,\u201d says Rosalind Picard, a computer scientist at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nWhat the research shows\n\nEarly studies give a glimpse of the potential of mood forecasting.\n\nA team led by Picard reported last June that an experimental wrist sensor could pinpoint stress. The team followed 201 college students for five semesters. Each wore an experimental sensor, developed by Picard, that monitored body temperature, phone activity and skin conductance (how well skin conducts electricity). The research, published last year in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, showed that the sensor was 80 percent accurate in determining when students were feeling stressed.\n\nIn unpublished research conducted from 2015 to 2018, Nock found that a wristband that tracked psychiatric patients\u2019 movement, skin conductance and body temperature could predict suicidal thoughts about one day before they arose. The prediction was about 75 percent accurate.\n\nAnd researchers at the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan conducted an eight-week study of nine people diagnosed with bipolar disorder and found that changes in phone use predicted symptoms of both depression and mania. \u201cMood states in bipolar disorder appear to correlate with specific changes in mobile phone usage,\u201d the authors wrote in their 2018 publication in the Journal of Internet Medical Research.\n\nSuch research is preliminary, and the results aren\u2019t perfect. But mental health professionals are taking notice.\n\nLast year, when the family of one of his female patients contacted Vahia, the McLean hospital psychiatrist, to alert him to her rising anxiety, he convinced her to start wearing a fitness tracker. Three weeks later, the data it collected showed something that the patient's family had missed: her nightly sleep duration had dropped by almost an hour.\n\nWhen a change in medication failed to ease that problem, Vahia had the patient hospitalized for psychotherapy and a thorough adjustment of her medication \u2014 sparing her \u201cat least a couple of weeks\u201d of anxiety-ridden misery.\n\nFor his next study, Nock plans to test the bio-sensing wristband on psychiatric patients after they\u2019ve left the hospital following a suicidal episode. In this case, information from smartphones and wristbands goes to a database. If the research team spots a cause for concern, they\u2019ll contact patients to encourage them to reach out for help, whether by calling 911 or a crisis service center or their doctor.\n\nMoving forward despite privacy concerns\n\nIf mood forecasting shows great promise, some see peril in the collection and transmission of such intimate personal data \u2014 and that includes some of the scientists working to develop the technology.\n\nPicard worries that employers might gain access to the data and discriminate against employees or job seekers. And Jukka-Pekka Onnela, director of the health data science program at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, cautions that more research is needed to tell the difference between a normal digital phenotype and one that's cause for concern.\n\nDespite these and other concerns, mood-forecasting products are coming \u2014 or, in some cases, are already here.\n\nMindstrong, a firm in Palo Alto, California, is developing an app designed to track mental health by monitoring smartphone activity. Another company, San Francisco-based SpireHealth, has developed a biomarker-reading wearable that can be tucked into a sock or a bra. On the fashion-futuristic side, the Ger Mood sweater features a collar that changes color according to changes in the skin.\n\nMany other products are in development. Picard hopes to adapt for mood forecasting a wristband she originally developed for predicting epileptic seizures. A United Kingdom-based software developer hopes to bring his \u201cMindYourself\u201d mood-forecasting wearable to market.\n\nBut even if mood forecasting lives up to its promise, experts are under no illusion that mood-tracking apps and devices will replace mental health professionals.\n\n\u201cThe essence of psychiatry remains between a person and a provider,\u201d Vahia says, adding that the technology provides only \u201can extra layer of meaningful information.\u201d\n\nBut Picard says mood forecasting could be the difference between feeling good and suffering. \u201cWe\u2019d love to get to you before you get depressed,\u201d she says, \u201cand help you put things back in your life before you get in trouble.\u201d\n\nWant more stories about technology?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/watch-space-harpoon-spear-piece-orbiting-debris-ncna973656", "text": "Get the Mach newsletter.\n\nFeb. 20, 2019, 7:32 PM GMT By Denise Chow\n\nIt\u2019s a hit! A harpoon designed to help clean up the hundreds of thousands of pieces of space junk now orbiting Earth passed a key test earlier this month when it successfully speared a piece of simulated debris.\n\nAs dramatic footage of the Feb. 8 test shows, a European satellite known as \u201cRemoveDebris\u201d test-fired a barbed titanium spear about the size of a writing pen at an aluminum panel attached to the satellite by a short boom. The harpoon, shot from the refrigerator-sized satellite at a speed of 44 miles an hour and trailing a tether, slammed into the panel \u2014 and stuck to it, as planned.\n\n\u201cWe are really happy so far,\u201d said Guglielmo Aglietti, director of the Surrey Space Centre in England and lead investigator of the $15 million project. \u201cThe target was made of the same material as a satellite, so it\u2019s quite representative of how the whole thing would work.\u201d\n\nIn an actual mission to clean up space junk, a satellite would use a much larger space harpoon to snare debris and then drag it down into the atmosphere, where the entire assemblage would burn up harmlessly. Aglietti likened the maneuver to a kamikaze mission.\n\nFrom spent rocket parts to defunct satellites to stray nuts and bolts, the U.S. Department of Defense now tracks more than 500,000 pieces of human-made debris that have accumulated in orbit around Earth. All that trash poses a serious and growing collision threat to passing spacecraft, including the International Space Station, as well as satellites that cost billions of dollars.\n\n\u201cStatistically, every five to nine years, we have to expect one so-called catastrophic collision in which a defunct, but still intact, large [piece of] space debris gets hit and fragments into thousands of new fragments,\u201d Manuel Metz, a space debris expert at the German Aerospace Center in Bonn who isn\u2019t involved with the RemoveDebris project, told NBC News MACH in an email Tuesday. \u201cThese new fragments might themselves create new collisions and thus a cascading effect might begin\u201d \u2014 a potentially disastrous phenomenon known as the Kessler syndrome that was depicted in the 2013 movie \u201cGravity.\u201d\n\nAglietti thinks it makes sense to focus initially on removing the biggest pieces of debris because they pose the greatest danger. The idea would be to launch a series of the debris-cleaning satellites and have them capture and eliminate a few pieces each year.\n\nIf the ongoing RemoveDebris mission concludes successfully, Aglietti hopes that aerospace companies would be willing to fund the missions to clean up the space junk. \"This is a proof of concept,\" he said. \"If it works, we hope our industrial partners will move it forward into a business.\"\n\nThe harpoon demonstration was the second in a series of tests of experimental debris-collecting devices conducted by the RemoveDebris satellite, which was built by a consortium of universities and aerospace companies and was funded principally by the European Union.\n\nLast September, the satellite successfully used a spring-loaded net to capture a piece of mock debris. In March, the satellite will attach an inflatable \u201cdrag sail\u201d to a piece of debris -- mission scientists expect the sail to collide with the few air molecules that are present at the satellite\u2019s altitude, slowing the debris and causing it to descend into the atmosphere and burn up.\n\nVarious other devices have been proposed for capturing and eliminating space debris, including self-propelled tethers and robotic arms. Aglietti said the harpoon, net and drag sail were chosen for the RemoveDebris project because they were considered especially economical.\n\nMoriba Jah, a space scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and an expert on orbital debris, said it would be good to have more than one way to eliminate all the accumulated junk. \"The active removal of space debris will require many different methods and techniques,\" he said in an email Tuesday. \u201cI believe we need to have a so-called \u2018toolkit\u2019 of methods that can be applied as best and appropriate.\u201d\n\nWant more stories about space?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/video/climate-change-will-cause-the-world-s-oceans-to-change-color-1445444163914", "text": "Climate change will cause the world's oceans to change color 01:16 copied!\n\nWarmer and more acidic oceans will cause populations of phytoplankton to decline, which could affect the water's hue and impact nearly every kind of fish that we eat.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/fda-tightens-regulation-over-counter-sunscreen-products-n974271", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Therefore, the FDA is still encouraging sunscreen users to continue using skin protectants as the rulemaking process continues.\n\n\u201cIt is important that, as this rulemaking effort moves forward and the FDA gathers additional scientific information, given the recognized public health benefits of sunscreen use, consumers continue to use sunscreen in conjunction with other sun-protection measures,\u201d said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in a statement.\n\nAlthough sunscreen has been in existence since the 1940s it has only been regulated by the FDA since 1978. In May 2018, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) released a new enforcement policy for over-the-counter sunscreen drug products marketed without an approved application, the first revision of policy since 2011.\n\nEnvironmental Working Group (EWG), a nonprofit health and environmental advocacy group, called the proposal a \u201cbig step toward cleaning up a largely unregulated industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect many companies to quickly reformulate to avoid those ingredients that the FDA considers unsafe or for which there is not enough data to prove safety,\u201d said Scott Faber of EWG on a press call after FDA\u2019s announcement.\n\nDr. Shamard Charles of NBC News contributed to this report."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/measles-kills-900-madagascar-according-who-report-n974171", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Most cases this season are the milder H1N1 variety.\n\nThe advisory board recommended that next year\u2019s flu vaccine cover the H1N1 strain and two types of the influenza B virus. The H3N2 strain will also be covered, the board said. The specific subtype will be announced in March.\n\n\u201cIn light of recent changes in the proportions of genetically and antigenically diverse A(H3N2) viruses, the recommendation for the A(H3N2) component has been postponed,\u201d WHO said in a statement.\n\nWHO convenes advisers in February and September each year to recommend viruses for inclusion in the vaccines for the upcoming influenza season. Flu strains are different in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, so WHO holds separate meetings to discuss each region.\n\nThe recommendations are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines.\n\nEvery flu vaccine is a cocktail, aimed at either three or four of the most common flu strains. Flu vaccines must be reformulated every year because flu viruses mutate constantly in a process called antigenic drift. This season\u2019s flu shot contains four strains \u2014 H1N1, H3N2, Influenza A and Influenza B \u2014 in what\u2019s known as a quadrivalent vaccine.\n\nSo far this year\u2019s flu season has been mild, in part due to a good match between the virus strains in circulation and this season\u2019s flu vaccine.\n\nIn its weekly report last week, the CDC said the interim estimate of the flu vaccine\u2019s effectiveness against the H1N1 influenza strain was 47 percent. For context, at this time last year the midseason effectiveness of the vaccine was just 36 percent. Sixty percent effectiveness for the entire season is considered a great number.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons we give flu vaccine is to prevent complications,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease expert at Vanderbilt University and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \"Milder illness means people are less likely to have the complications that land them in the hospital.\u201d\n\n\"A flu vaccine that matches well with the viruses that are circulating prevents complications, severe illness and deaths,\u201d Schaffner told NBC News.\n\nThis season, nearly 90 percent of the flu cases tested by the CDC are turning out to be H1N1, the milder variety. A milder dominant strain and a more effective vaccine have resulted in less hospitalizations and deaths this season. Last season, 50 million people caught flu and 80,000 died in the worst flu season in decades. Currently, the CDC estimates 11,600 to 19,100 deaths from Oct. 1 to Feb. 9 in what it has called \u201ca low-severity influenza season.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/sexual-health/trump-plan-beat-hiv-hits-rough-road-rural-america-n974061", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But they say strategies that work in progressive cities like Seattle won\u2019t necessarily work in rural areas of Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina.\n\nStigma around HIV and AIDS and around being gay runs deep in parts of Oklahoma, said Dr. Michelle Salvaggio, medical director of the Infectious Diseases Institute at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. The institute is one of two federally funded HIV clinics in Oklahoma; the other is in Tulsa, the state\u2019s second-largest city.\n\nA Long Drive For Anonymity\n\nSalvaggio\u2019s clinic has six exam rooms where she sees patients, many of whom drive hours for treatment. The clinic used to employ a case manager in rural Woodward County, a little more than two hours\u2019 drive northwest of Oklahoma City.\n\nBut Salvaggio said that ended up being a waste of money. \u201cWe had to let that position go, because nobody would go see her,\u201d Salvaggio said. \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t want to be seen walking into the HIV case manager\u2019s office in that tiny town \u2014 that can only mean one thing.\u201d\n\nIn Oklahoma, as in much of the U.S., black gay and bisexual men have the highest risk of HIV infection. Other groups with elevated risk in Oklahoma include Latinos, heterosexual women and Native Americans.\n\nSalvaggio applauds the goal of ending HIV transmissions within 10 years but said she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible in Oklahoma. The plan fails to recognize the particular ways different populations experience the epidemic, she said.\n\nNative Americans in Oklahoma, for example, can\u2019t count on the anonymity of a large health clinic.\n\n\u201cWhen they go into an Indian Health Service clinic, it is possible that they will see their cousin behind the desk, and their cousin\u2019s brother-in-law working in medical records, and their niece\u2019s boyfriend working in the pharmacy,\u201d Salvaggio said.\n\nEven if Native Americans have access to HIV care at the clinic, she said, \u201cthey are literally in fear of being outed.\u201d\n\nSocial Support Services Needed\n\nKy Humble\u2019s hometown is Afton, Okla., which had a population of about 800 when he was growing up. He belongs to the Cherokee Nation and was raised a Southern Baptist. He doesn\u2019t remember learning about HIV at all when he was in school.\n\n\u201cEven if I did, it clearly wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Humble said. \u201cI knew I was gay in middle school; I think I would have paid attention.\u201d\n\nWhen he was diagnosed with HIV six years ago, at age 21, Humble felt as if his life was ending.\n\n\u201cI knew that that was a thing, [but] I was very ignorant,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was two weeks away from graduating from college \u2014 you\u2019re supposed to be on top of the world. I thought it was a death sentence.\u201d\n\nHe called his mom right away. She immediately drove across the state to be with him.\n\n\u201cWe just sat there and cried for six hours straight,\u201d Humble said. \u201cAnd then we actually went [out] and bought several books on HIV, and just started reading them \u2014 to try to figure out what was going on.\u201d\n\nToday, Humble is healthy. His HIV levels are undetectable and he gets regular medical treatment to keep it that way. He now lives in Oklahoma City, but his family still lives in his hometown. He said some people back in Afton know he has HIV, and some don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like coming out as diabetic,\u201d Humble said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily tell people that I\u2019m HIV-positive. It\u2019s just part of who I am; it doesn\u2019t define me.\u201d\n\nHe said he is cautiously optimistic that the Trump administration\u2019s plan could mean more funding for HIV prevention in Oklahoma. But rural Oklahomans, Humble said, also need access to \u201cwraparound services\u201d \u2014 such as food pantries, mental health therapy and transportation assistance \u2014 to help them deal with the disease.\n\n\u201cI have friends who have HIV and live in rural areas, and just getting to appointments is challenging,\u201d he said.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s Uninsured Rate Is Second-Highest In U.S.\n\nExactly how much money the president\u2019s HIV plan will get is up to Congress. But even inexpensive, proven methods for fighting HIV \u2014 like distributing condoms \u2014 can be a tough sell in a state that doesn\u2019t mandate comprehensive sex education.\n\nInformational HIV talks with teenagers often turn into a basic health class for dispelling myths, said Andy Moore, clinic administrator of the Infectious Diseases Institute at the University of Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had teenagers write questions like \u2018I\u2019ve heard that if you douche with Mountain Dew after sex that it kills sperm,'\u201d Moore said. They earnestly want to know if that\u2019s true. \u201cWe have to back way up and explain what sex is, how babies are made, different types of sex \u2014 before we can teach them about HIV prevention,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother issue in Oklahoma, Moore said, is that people aren\u2019t getting diagnosed with HIV until they\u2019re already sick because of AIDS, or close to that point.\n\n\u201cWhich indicates that they didn\u2019t get tested until they had been living with the disease for six, eight, 10 years,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe have one of the highest rates of late testing.\u201d\n\nSalvaggio said thousands of people across Oklahoma would need to be tested for HIV to reach the administration\u2019s goal. And Oklahoma has the second-highest uninsured rate in the nation after Texas \u2014 meaning many people don\u2019t have a primary care doctor, let alone prescription drug coverage for drugs like Truvada, which can be used to prevent HIV infection.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of 14 states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. So, even if more people were tested for HIV, getting those who need it into treatment wouldn\u2019t be easy, Salvaggio said.\n\nHealth care in Oklahoma is underfunded, she said, and couldn\u2019t cope with a sudden influx of new patients. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do with all those new patients,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a facility to see them in, and we don\u2019t have [the] providers.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes StateImpact Oklahoma, NPR and Kaiser Health News.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Now the world\u2019s governments have to decide how and whether to reintegrate them into their societies.\n\nAs the militants retain only a tiny sliver of territory in Syria, Western countries are being forced to grapple with how to deal with minors who qualify for citizenship through their parents, including foreign fighters who carried out atrocities abroad.\n\nA plea last week by a British ISIS bride to return to the U.K. with her infant son illustrates the conundrum.\n\nThe family of 19-year-old Shamima Begum \u2014 one of three British high school students who together abandoned their lives in east London in 2015 to marry ISIS fighters \u2014 has appealed for the U.K. government to help bring the pair home from a refugee camp. They cited the innocence of Begum's newborn child.\n\nBritish teenagers Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum pass through security barriers at Gatwick Airport near London as they started their journey to Syria in 2015.

Such comments have triggered a debate in Britain about whether Begum can and should be rehabilitated back into society.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.K. government informed Begum's family it intended to strip the teenager of her citizenship, according to her family's lawyer.\n\nThis morning I told Shamima Begum that she had been stripped of her British citizenship - and showed her the letter that had been sent to her family. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of heartbreaking to read\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to swallow\u201d pic.twitter.com/fO6xIoSBS9 \u2014 Rohit Kachroo (@RohitKachrooITV) February 20, 2019\n\nUnder international law countries are obliged to allow their nationals to return home. But European countries have been reluctant to take back home-grown fighters and their families believe they are safer outside of Europe. Britain has even gone so far as to revoke the citizenship of more than 100 ISIS fighters who had dual nationality.\n\nBritish interior minister Sajid Javid wrote in an opinion piece in The Sunday Times newspaper that while he felt \u201ccompassion for any child born or brought into a conflict zone\" when considering the repatriation of their parents who joined the Islamic State he has to think about \u201cthe safety and security\u201d of children living in the U.K.\n\nBut Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics, said any country which chose to punish children for the crimes of their parents would be haunted by that decision.\n\n\u201cIts shortsightedness,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot leave them in the desert, in the wilderness because they\u2019re going to grow to be wild or feel the need or urge to exact revenge.\"\n\nChildren are transported to a refugee camp after leaving Bagouz, Syria, on Feb. 11.

About 50 other Russian children were expected to return soon, according to the Associated Press.\n\nGerges said governments also have a legal and ethical responsibility to help these children reintegrate. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault that their fathers are killers and their mothers were participants\u201d in the Islamic State, he said.\n\nOver the weekend, President Donald Trump called on European countries to take back the captured ISIS fighters or risk them being released. \u201cThe United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\nFrance has said it will repatriate ISIS fighters on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis and Germany has said while citizens have the right to return home it is difficult for the government to assess how many German citizens are actually affected.\n\nNBC News security analyst Duncan Gardham said ISIS recruits who wish to return home to the U.K. would have to travel to a British Consulate in Iraq or Turkey and the same would apply for their children.\n\nCouples living in the caliphate were encouraged to marry young and to have as many children as possible so the next generation could \u201ccontinue to carry the jihad banner,\u201d Gerges said, adding that many ISIS fighters also married more than one woman.\n\nGardham said from a children would be forced to watch and participate in the execution of ISIS prisoners.\n\n\u201cThe motto of ISIS is you\u2019re never too young to start thinking about jihad,\u201d he said. \u201cIndoctrinating children into violence is very much part of their ethos.\u201d\n\nAn ISIS math textbook obtained by NBC News in 2017 showed images of guns, bullets and tanks to help explain basic math, while an English language workbook used illustrations of bombs to teach how to read the time.\n\nMohammed Elshimi, a researcher at the London-based Royal United Services Institute defense think tank, said the working assumption should be that the children of ISIS-linked parents are both vulnerable and dangerous.\n\nElshimi said risk assessments would be needed on a case-by-case basis, with those closer to the age of 18 more capable of posing a real threat.\n\n\u201cSome of these children have received bomb training,\u201d he added."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/top-north-korean-official-says-his-country-faces-major-food-n973361", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He said a food assessment, conducted late last year in conjunction with the UN's World Food Program, found that the country produced 503,000 fewer tons of food than in 2017 due to record high temperatures, drought, heavy rainfall and \u2014 in an unexpected admission \u2014 sanctions.\n\nThe food agency could not immediately confirm that the organization conducted an assessment with North Korea or the conclusions the country shared in the memo.\n\nIn a plea for food assistance from international organizations, however, the memo states that sanctions \u201crestricting the delivery of farming materials in need is another major reason\u201d the country faces shortages that has forced it to cut \u201cfood rations per capita for a family of blue or white collar workers\u201d from 550 grams to 300 grams in January.\n\n\u201cAll in all, it vindicates that humanitarian assistance from the UN agencies is terribly politicized and how barbaric and inhuman sanctions are,\u201d the memo says.\n\nThough the country plans to increase food imports and harvest its crops early this year, the memo says that North Korea would still face food shortages and may only increase rations by 10 grams in July.\n\nThis unusual admission from a country that tends toward secrecy came just before President Donald Trump prepares to face North Korea leader Kim Jong Un next week in Vietnam. The White House hopes to pressure Kim to rid his country of nuclear weapons.\n\nExperts warned, however, that the claims of a severe shortage might be a negotiating tactic ahead of the two-day summit.\n\n\u201cIt may be admitting weakness, but it\u2019s not without a plan,\u201d said Dr. Victor Cha, who served as the director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council during the Bush administration.\n\nCha said that North Korea may feel that it has some momentum to convince Trump to loosen the sanctions against it, especially with South Korea, China and Russia \u201cbeating down the doors of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut for the United States to blink in next week\u2019s confrontation, the Trump administration will have to see results, Cha said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to want some denuclearization steps from North Korea, but I don\u2019t think the North Koreans are going to give up very much,\u201d Cha said. \u201cWhen we talk about any sanction-lifting though, a lot of experts would say the place where you can do the least harm and the most good for the North Korean people is through humanitarian sanctions.\u201d\n\nOf North Korea\u2019s 25 million people, 10.3 million or 41 percent of the population face food insecurity and 10.1 million suffer from malnutrition, according to a March 2018 UN report.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un provides field guidance to Farm No. 1116 under KPA Unit 810, in this undated photo released in Pyongyang Sept. 13, 2016. KCNA / via Reuters file\n\nIn an attempt to increase the pressure against Kim\u2019s regime and their nuclear program, the Trump administration increased sanctions that essentially cut off the flow of international humanitarian aid to North Korea, according to an August Reuters report. U.S. humanitarian aid in 2018 dropped nearly 57 percent from the year prior, the wire service reported.\n\nThough it is clear that North Korea is receiving less aid, it is more than unusual for them to publicly admit that sanctions are working and causing the nation to suffer.\n\nThe White House National Security Council and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNorth Korea has previously acknowledged food shortages, appealed for humanitarian aid and blamed international sanctions for creating problems for its agricultural production, experts and former U.S. officials said.\n\nThe country has repeatedly suffered food crises in recent decades, due to a combination of inefficient collectivist farming methods and bad weather. A devastating famine in the mid-1990s claimed the lives of up to three million people, and some aid experts called it one of the 20th century\u2019s worst famines.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration stopped granting visas to humanitarian workers who had been traveling to North Korea to provide aid to farmers and medical assistance in a country where malaria and tuberculosis are endemic. Aid groups wrote a letter to the administration in October arguing that the block on visas violated international law, would exacerbate the country\u2019s dire humanitarian situation and that would only undermine any diplomatic initiative by Washington.\n\nThe administration told aid groups in January it would ease the restrictions to allow them to resume their work in the North.\n\nDaniel Jasper, advocacy coordinator for the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker charity that has conducted humanitarian work in North Korea for decades, said the sanctions and the way they have been enforced has \u201cinhibited our operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to infer there would be food insecurity\u201d as a result of the sanctions, Jasper said.\n\nEven if North Korea managed its resources more efficiently, it does not have enough arable land to feed its population of about 24 million people, Jasper said. Much of the Korean peninsula\u2019s fertile land lies in South Korea.\n\n\u201cThe division has always taken a toll on food security in the North,\u201d he said.\n\nThe North Korean regime in the past also has linked negotiations over its nuclear program to food aid, demanding more assistance as a condition for taking part in talks.\n\nThe new memo is consistent with Pyongyang\u2019s tactics \u201cto weaken the sanctions regime by appealing to humanitarian concerns,\u201d said Jung Pak, a former CIA officer and now senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cEven though the regime imports hundreds of millions of dollars in luxury items, it consistently blames the U.S. and U.N. for its problems,\u201d she said.\n\nSue Mi Terry, who tracked North Korea as a CIA analyst, said she believes the regime is preparing the way for the upcoming summit.\n\n\u201cWhat they want is sanctions relief. That\u2019s the main thing that they\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Terry, now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThey are laying the groundwork for this meeting with Trump. This makes sense.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration will probably be open to broadening exemptions for humanitarian aid, as it would be something concrete to offer to Pyongyang without having to fully lift the economic sanctions before North Korea makes substantial concessions over its nuclear weapons program, she said.\n\nThis could be \u201cone of the deliverables at this second summit,\u201d Terry said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea", "text": "Video\n\nOtto Warmbier\u2019s parents speak out after Trump says Kim Jong Un not to blame for son\u2019s death"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/state-department-video-uses-former-embassy-send-message-iranians-n972911", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Yet it could also open up the administration to the criticism that it is exploiting a diplomatic facility and Iranian asset for propaganda.\n\nThe video appears aimed at circumventing the Tehran government to make a case to citizens in Iran and the diaspora why they should cease support for the government, an ultimate goal of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure campaign.\u201d\n\nThe State Department is circulating the video on its social media platforms in Farsi that target Iranian audiences, including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Telegram.\n\nNBC News journalists spotted senior U.S. officials who work on Iran policy earlier this month with a film crew outside the embassy along Washington\u2019s Massachusetts Ave., known as \u201cEmbassy Row.\u201d A copy of the video was then shared with NBC News ahead of its release.\n\nIn the video, the Trump administration\u2019s special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, strolls pensively past the ornate teal-and-beige embassy. He says in English that the U.S. has been caring for the embassy\u2019s security, maintenance and landscaping for 40 years, since the countries cut ties amid the revolution.\n\n\u201cEven the Persian rugs and artwork that were once here are still preserved in temperature-controlled storage facilities to give back to the Iranian people once our diplomatic ties are restored,\u201d Hook says.\n\n\u201cI wish I could say the same for the government in Tehran,\u201d he adds, as the screen shows black and white images of a blindfolded man and three captors, ostensibly from the Iran hostage crisis.\n\nOther images in the video contrast the sleepy street scene outside the Iranian embassy with scenes of violence, poverty, protests and fighters with shoulder-fired rockets in Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration has struggled to bring other countries along in its strategy to put enough pressure on the Iranian government that it either changes course or collapses. Following Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, other world powers who are a part of that deal have refused to follow the U.S. by withdrawing or re-imposing sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe gulf among allies was on display last week during a U.S.-sponsored Mideast summit in Warsaw and over the weekend when Vice President Mike Pence attended the Munich Security Conference.\n\nHook, the Iran envoy, told NBC News that the idea for the video emerged during an afternoon drive past the embassy, as he observed how meticulously the embassy is maintained. The U.S. government took control of the embassy decades ago after the U.S. Embassy in Iran was seized.\n\n\u201cWe follow the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and the Iranian regime violates it,\u201d Hook says. \u201cThere\u2019s something hopeful about how we are maintaining their embassy, and someday we will return the keys to the Iranian people.\"\n\nHe said the Iranians had turned the American embassy in Iran into a \u201cpropaganda museum open to the public,\u201d adorned with \u201cDeath to America\u201d signs.

Tom Barrack, a prominent Trump backer with business ties to the Middle East, also became involved in the project, the report says.\n\nJust days after Trump's inauguration, backers of the project sent documents to Flynn for Trump to approve, including a draft Cabinet memo stating that the president had appointed Barrack as a special representative to implement the plan and directing agencies to support Barrack's efforts, the report says.\n\nCareer national security officials objected to the plan, citing what they deemed Flynn's conflict of interest, and also that the proposal sought to bypass a policy review that is required whenever nuclear technology is transferred to another country, the report says.\n\nThe proposal, which involved enlisting the U.S. nuclear power industry to build nuclear plants across the Middle East, was backed by a group of retired generals who formed a firm called IP3. Flynn described himself in financial disclosure filings as an \"advisor\" to a subsidiary of IP3, IronBridge Group Inc., from June 2016 to December 2016 \u2014 at the same time he was serving as Trump's national security adviser during the presidential campaign and the presidential transition, the report says.\n\nThe report quotes one senior Trump official as saying that the proposal was \"not a business plan,\" but rather \"a scheme for these generals to make some money,\" and added, \"OK, you know we cannot do this.\"\n\nClick here to read the House Oversight Committee report.\n\n\"The whistleblowers who came forward have expressed significant concerns about the potential procedural and legal violations connected with rushing through a plan to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia,\" the report says.\n\n\"They have warned of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes. They have also warned about a working environment inside the White House marked by chaos, dysfunction, and backbiting.\"\n\nThe Oversight Committee, led by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said its investigation of the plan \"is particularly critical because the administration's efforts to transfer sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia appear to be ongoing.\"\n\nOn Feb. 12, the report notes, Trump met with nuclear power developers at the White House about sharing nuclear technology with countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia. Next week Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner is set to embark on a tour of Middle Eastern capitals \u2014 including Riyadh \u2014 to discuss the economic portion of the administration's Middle East peace plan.\n\n\"Experts worry that transferring sensitive U.S. nuclear technology could allow Saudi Arabia to produce nuclear weapons that contribute to the proliferation of nuclear arms throughout an already unstable Middle East,\" the report says.\n\nMarshall Plan for the Middle East\n\nThe proposal, dubbed by its backers a \"Middle East Marshall Plan,\" involved IP3 International, which is short for \"International Peace Power & Prosperity.\" Among those involved with IP3, according to published reports, were Gens. Keith Alexander, Jack Keane and James Cartwright; former Middle East envoy Dennis Ross; George W. Bush homeland security adviser Fran Townsend; and Robert \"Bud\" McFarlane, who was one of Ronald Reagan's national security advisers. Keane was considered by Trump for secretary of defense.\n\nThe House oversight report says whistleblowers told the committee that one of Flynn's top aides, Derek Harvey \u2014 who was the senior director for Middle East and North African Affairs at the National Security Council from January to July 2017 \u2014 stated during the first week of the Trump administration that Flynn had already decided to adopt IP3's nuclear plan and develop \"dozens of nuclear power plants.\"\n\nSeven days after the inauguration \u2014 and two days before a scheduled call with King Salman of Saudi Arabia \u2014 Harvey met in his office at the White House with a group of retired generals who work for IP3, including its co-founders, Keane and McFarlane, the report says.\n\nImmediately after the meeting, Harvey directed the NSC staff to add information about IP3's \"plan for 40 nuclear power plants\" to the briefing package for Trump's call with King Salman.\n\nThe report says career staff warned that any transfer of nuclear technology must comply with the Atomic Energy Act, and that the United States and Saudi Arabia would need to reach what is known as a \"123 Agreement,\" which would lay out how Saudi Arabia should comply with nonproliferation requirements.\n\n\"Harvey reportedly ignored these warnings and insisted that the decision to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia had already been made,\" the report says.\n\nBoth career and political staff inside the White House agreed that Harvey's directive could violate the law, the report says.\n\nAccording to whistleblowers, the National Security Council's ethics lawyer determined that Flynn's involvement could violate the criminal conflict of interest statute, the report says. As a result, NSC legal adviser John Eisenberg instructed NSC staff to cease all work on the plan.\n\nBut Harvey continued to pursue the matter, the report says, even after Flynn had been fired in February 2017 for lying to the FBI.\n\nHarvey stated during a meeting on March 2, 2017: \"I speak with Michael Flynn every night,\" the report says.\n\nIn mid-March 2017, deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland reportedly stated during a meeting that Trump told Barrack that he could lead the implementation of the plan, the report says.\n\nHarvey subsequently held a conference call with Barrack and Rick Gates, Trump's former deputy campaign manager and deputy chairman of the Inaugural Committee, who has pleaded guilty to crimes and is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAt the time, Gates had been hired by Barrack to manage the Washington office of Barrack's company. A career NSC staffer who joined the call later told colleagues that Harvey was trying to promote the IP3 plan \"so that Jared Kushner can present it to the president for approval,\" the report says.\n\nFlynn's replacement, H.R. McMaster, ultimately ordered the council to cease all work on the matter, the report says. He fired Harvey, who is now a minority staffer for the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nInaugural Committee chairman Tom Barrack speaks at at a pre-Inaugural \"Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\" at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington on Jan. 19, 2017. David J. Phillip / AP file\n\nThe report raises further questions about Flynn, who is awaiting sentencing as he cooperates with Mueller. It says Flynn failed to report in his security clearance renewal application a trip he took to Saudi Arabia in June 2015 on behalf of IP3 and its predecessor company. Although he reported a separate trip to Saudi Arabia in October 2015, Flynn omitted key details, the report says, including the identity of the client that financed the trip.\n\nFlynn claimed he spoke at a conference during the trip, but none of his three speakers' bureaus had any involvement with the trip or knew of any conference there, the report says. Flynn told investigators that he stayed at the King Khaled International Hotel, but a U.S. consulate official could not identify any such hotel in Saudi Arabia, the report says.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats in Congress have expressed concerns about transferring nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, the report notes.\n\nIn October, Republican Senators Marco Rubio, Todd Young, Cory Gardner, Rand Paul, and Dean Heller sent a letter to Trump urging him to \"suspend talks related to a potential civil nuclear cooperation agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia\" due to \"serious concerns about the transparency, accountability, and judgment of current decisionmakers in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThey said they were concerned that \"the Saudi Government has refused, for many years, to consider any agreement that includes so-called 'Gold Standard' requirements against pursuing technologies to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium-laden spent nuclear fuel.\"\n\nThe House Oversight Committee is sending requests for additional documents to the White House and the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, State, and Treasury, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA, and companies involved with this effort, including IP3, the Flynn Intel Group, ACU Strategies, and Colony NorthStar, the report says.\n\nThe committee is also seeking interviews with the key people involved with promoting this plan to the White House.\n\nThe White House, Harvey and an attorney for Flynn did not immediately respond to NBC News requests for comment."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/ukraine-military-forces-preparing-for-potential-showdown-at-sea-with-russia-1444494403557", "text": "Ukraine military forces preparing for potential showdown at sea with Russia 01:14 copied!\n\nNBC\u2019s Bill Neely is on the frontlines in Ukraine, where the military -- backed by the U.S. -- is also fighting against Russian-backed militias.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/american-companies-being-targeted-by-renewed-cyber-attacks-from-china-and-iran-1444501059806", "text": "American companies being targeted by renewed cyber attacks from China and Iran 01:11 copied!\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the cyber attacks are hitting dozens of major corporations -- like Boeing, GE Aviation and T-Mobile -- along with U.S. banks and government agencies, costing an estimated hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/american-and-british-isis-brides-plead-to-return-home-1444493379789", "text": "American and British ISIS brides plead to return home 01:16 copied!\n\nHoda Muthana, an American woman from Alabama, is making a desperate plea to be allowed to return home, four years after she fled the United States to become the bride of an ISIS fighter in Syria.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFeb. 19, 2019, 5:00 PM GMT By Josh Lederman\n\nBERLIN \u2014 The Trump administration is launching a global campaign to end the criminalization of homosexuality in dozens of nations where it's still illegal to be gay, U.S. officials tell NBC News, a bid aimed in part at denouncing Iran over its human rights record.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality \u2014 mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning that, in the 21st century, some 70 countries continue to have laws that criminalize LGBTI status or conduct,\u201d said a U.S. official involved in organizing the event.\n\nAlthough the decriminalization strategy is still being hashed out, officials say it\u2019s likely to include working with global organizations like the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as other countries whose laws already allow for gay rights. Other U.S. embassies and diplomatic posts throughout Europe, including the U.S. Mission to the E.U., are involved, as is the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.\n\nNarrowly focused on criminalization, rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage, the campaign was conceived partly in response to the recent reported execution by hanging of a young gay man in Iran, the Trump administration\u2019s top geopolitical foe.\n\nGrenell, as Trump\u2019s envoy to Germany, has been an outspoken Iran critic and has aggressively pressed European nations to abandon the 2015 nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions. But while the Trump administration has had some success in pressuring Iran through stepped-up U.S. penalties, efforts to bring the Europeans along have thus far largely fallen flat.\n\nReframing the conversation on Iran around a human rights issue that enjoys broad support in Europe could help the United States and Europe reach a point of agreement on Iran. Grenell called the hanging \u201ca wake-up call for anyone who supports basic human rights,\u201d in Bild, a leading German newspaper, this month.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time the Iranian regime has put a gay man to death with the usual outrageous claims of prostitution, kidnapping, or even pedophilia. And it sadly won\u2019t be the last time,\u201d Grenell wrote. \u201cBarbaric public executions are all too common in a country where consensual homosexual relationships are criminalized and punishable by flogging and death.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cpoliticians, the U.N., democratic governments, diplomats and good people everywhere should speak up \u2014 and loudly.\u201d\n\nYet by using gay rights as a cudgel against Iran, the Trump administration risks exposing close U.S. allies who are also vulnerable on the issue and creating a new tension point with the one region where Trump has managed to strengthen U.S. ties: the Arab world.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, whose monarchy Trump has staunchly defended in the face of human rights allegations, homosexuality can be punishable by death, according to a 2017 worldwide report from the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA). The report identified 72 nations that still criminalize homosexuality, including eight where it\u2019s punishable by death.\n\nThat list includes the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Afghanistan \u2014 all U.S. allies \u2014 although those countries aren\u2019t known to have implemented the death penalty for same-sex acts. In Egypt, whose leader Trump has effusively praised, homosexual relations aren\u2019t technically illegal but other morality laws are used aggressively to target LGBT people.\n\nNew U.S. pressure on those countries to change their laws comes as the Trump administration is working to use nascent ties between Arab nations and Israel to form a powerful axis against Iran, a strategy that dovetails with the administration\u2019s planned rollout of an ambitious plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nIn the Gulf state of Oman, for example, the Trump administration has touted a recent, historic visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a sign that old taboos are eroding. But any campaign to decriminalize homosexuality would ostensibly also have to call out Oman, where prison sentences can be handed out for being gay.\n\nThe push to end laws that outlaw homosexuality abroad also stands in contrast to the Trump administration\u2019s mixed record on gay rights at home.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump was ambiguous about his position on many gay rights issues, but notably became the first Republican nominee to mention LGBT rights in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. His convention also featured another first: PayPal founder Peter Thiel became the first gay person to acknowledge his sexuality in a speech to the GOP convention, declaring he was \u201cproud to be gay.\u201d\n\nTrump, after being elected, also said he was \u201cfine\u201d with same-sex marriage. But since he took office, his administration has scaled back some workplace protections for gay people and has argued in court that a federal anti-discrimination law doesn\u2019t protect gay employees. He has also announced a ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. military, which the Supreme Court last month said could be implemented even as lower-court challenges play out.\n\nU.S. officials said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is supporting the work by U.S. embassies and consulates to fight violence and discrimination against LGBT people. In his Senate confirmation hearing, Pompeo asserted: \u201cI deeply believe that LGBTQ persons have every right that every other person in the world would have.\u201d\n\nGrenell, known for his hawkish views on national security, is also currently under consideration to be Trump\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., three U.S. officials tell NBC News, after Trump\u2019s previous pick for the job, Heather Nauert, withdrew from consideration over the weekend. Grenell once served as spokesman for the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. when that role was inhabited by John Bolton, who is now Trump\u2019s national security adviser.\n\nPlanning for the campaign to decriminalize homosexuality started before the U.N. job became open. It was a topic of conversation over the weekend at the Munich Security Conference, where Grenell discussed it with a visiting congressional delegation that included Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del.; and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas.\n\nDespite the dozens of countries that still outlaw homosexuality, LGBT rights have proliferated in recent years in many parts of the world. Two dozen countries now recognize same-sex marriage, according to the ILGA report, while another 28 recognize domestic partnerships. The last U.S. laws outlawing same-sex activity were invalidated by the Supreme Court in 2003 in Lawrence v. Texas.\n\nGrenell, in his editorial in Bild, pointed out that India, Belize, Angola, and Trinidad and Tobago recently decriminalized same-sex conduct among consenting adults. But he said \u201creasonable people\u201d must keep speaking out about laws in other places, including Iran and Chechnya, the Russian region where authorities have cracked down violently on gay people in recent years.\n\n\u201cWhile a student at Evangel University, a Christian liberal arts college in Missouri, I was taught by biblical scholars that all truth is God\u2019s truth, no matter where it is found. The truth for LGBT people is that we were born gay,\u201d Grenell wrote. \u201cPeople can disagree philosophically about homosexuality, but no person should ever be subject to criminal penalties because they are gay.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-hackers-8-times-faster-chinese-iranians-north-koreans-says-n972926", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

They sprint across a gully to avoid enemy snipers and make it to the relative safety of trenches that snake through a scarred landscape of barren trees and shattered buildings. Makeshift walkways of scrap wood do little to keep out the mud that is everywhere.\n\nThrough a small opening in a bunker, a soldier peers out into no-man\u2019s land as a heavy gun stands at the ready nearby. The enemy is just 300 yards away and the sound of artillery can be heard over the trench walls.\n\nThe crack of a sniper rifle rings out, but the soldiers don\u2019t react.\n\nUkrainian officer Dmitri Kebtz watches for separatist snipers. Bill O'Reilly / for NBC News\n\nThey\u2019ve been fighting here too long and the fire is too far away \u2014 this time.\n\nThe war in Eastern Ukraine is frozen. And what started as a seemingly internal squabble has become one of the most dangerous potential flashpoints between Russia and the United States.\n\nSome 13,000 people have been killed in the fighting since Russian-backed separatists declared independence and established their own \u201cPeople\u2019s Republics\u201d in April 2014, according to the United Nations.\n\nMore than 2,000 were killed last year alone, despite a ceasefire.\n\nUkraine is not yet a member of NATO, but it aspires to join the defense pact. Were that to happen, it could be a red line for Russian President Vladimir Putin and turn this regional conflict into a far larger war.\n\nAll this in a conflict that is technically under a ceasefire deal.\n\nClearly, those agreements brokered by diplomats and peacekeepers mean little for soldiers on the frontline, however.\n\nUkrainian officer Dmitri Kebtz has been fighting for three years. With his graying beard and AK-47 rifle slung over his shoulder, he looks every bit the part of the battle-hardened soldier. But this is not where he wants to be.\n\nKebtz shows debris from artillery on what was once a main highway connecting Kiev and the Russian border. Bill O'Reilly / for NBC News\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m civil.

Residents still live in this apartment complex, but much of it has been destroyed by artillery. Bill O'Reilly / for NBC News\n\nAt first Russia denied that it was playing any role in the conflict, but the casualties sent home and advanced weapons systems spotted in the area soon lifted the veil on their involvement.\n\nIt is estimated hundreds of Russians have died fighting in Ukraine, but the real number is hard to verify. Those killed in the conflict aren\u2019t named publicly \u2014 it\u2019s classified information under Russian law.\n\nThe Ukrainians have their share of outside help as well. The U.S. Army operates a training mission on the ground, though hundreds of miles from the fighting. And just last year the U.S. began supplying Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's relationship with NATO continues to be on edge, with his threats to pull out of the agreement alarming lawmakers in the U.S.\n\nIn November the conflict threatened to erupt when Russian forces shot at and seized three Ukrainian vessels off the coast of Crimea, prompting Ukraine to declare martial law.\n\nCaught in the middle are the civilians. More than 2 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, according to the United Nations.\n\nThose who remain in the separatist territories struggle to get by. Utilities and alcohol are cheap, says one resident of separatist-held Horlivka, but quality goods are impossible to find.\n\nJobs are few and retirees still rely on their Ukrainian pensions. Under law they must collect them in person every month, meaning a long and dangerous journey across the frontline at five official crossing points.\n\nRetirees living in separatist territory must cross the frontline every month to collect their pension checks. Bill O'Reilly / for NBC News\n\nOn a good day it can take eight hours to make it past the separatist checkpoints if they are willing to pay a bribe. If not, the wait can last as long as four days.\n\nOnce on the government-held side they are searched by the military, looking for separatists or contraband.\n\nIn the small town of Zaitjeve not far from the front, Taisiya, 90, chatted with a group of international monitors on a coffee break.\n\n\u201cThis is not a war,\u201d she said, boasting of her days supporting the Ukrainian partisans fighting against Nazi Germany in World War II. \u201cWe survived hunger and the war. We survived everything.\u201d\n\nShe said she didn\u2019t understand the point of this conflict that is once again bringing chaos to her rural world.\n\n\u201cWe gave life to the next generation and they\u2019re not paying us back,\u201d she said.\n\nBack at the front, Dimitri Kebtz takes a different view.\n\n\u201cWe are democratic European people,\u201d he said. \u201cI know in the U.S. freedom is real. I want the same freedom in Ukraine. Same democracy, same system. I don\u2019t want the system of Russia in this place.\u201d\n\nThat system could not be closer.

Thunberg went on to address the United Nations climate talks in December, declaring, \u201cOur political leaders have failed us.\u201d\n\nYoung demonstrators hold placards as they attend a climate change protest organised by \"Youth Strike 4 Climate\", in central London on Feb. 15.

Youth Strike 4 Climate estimated young people from nearly 60 communities across Britain took part in Friday's event. In London the demonstration brought traffic to a halt.\n\nThe students \u2014 many with the support of parents and even some teachers who also joined the march \u2014 said they wanted to get the message across that just because they\u2019re too young to vote doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be heard.\n\n\u201cLearning is important but this is even more important,\u201d said Orla De Wardener, 10, amid the growing crowd.\n\nOrganizers are planning to build on the momentum of Friday's strike to collaborate on a global walk-out on March 15 involving students from nearly 20 countries.\n\n\"This is definitely the beginning,\" Bond said. \"I think this is the start of a new era of student engagement in climate activism.\"\n\nExperts on political movements say the uprising reflects both fears of climate change and anger about the lack of control young people have over decisions that affect their futures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of their frustration that our generation, adults that do have the vote or are involved in politics and policy. We need to start listening to what young people are saying,\u201d said John Barry, a professor specializing in green political theory at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\n\nIt is a misconception that young people are not interested in politics, Barry said. But conversations young people are having on social media or in protests seldom reach the ears of decision makers.\n\n\u201cThere is very little public attention paid to those who are under 18,\u201d said Emily Rainsford, a research associate specializing in youth political participation at Newcastle University.\n\nAdults or parents are responsible for protecting youth and representing their best interests, but the issue of the environment is turning that norm on its head, Rainsford said.\n\n\u201cThere is a real intergenerational unfairness at the center of this issue,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s rare for demonstrations to result in policy changes, said Rainsford, but it can change attitudes.\n\nHistorically, Barry pointed to the U.S. civil rights and anti-Vietnam war protests \"where non-violent direct action got a lot of work done in terms of tipping the political system into taking these issues seriously.\"\n\nLondon's protest remained largely peaceful, with some teens playing music and younger students sitting in the grass on the sidelines to eat lunch.\n\nOne group staged a blockade of traffic, sitting in the street in front of buses and cars while they chanted profanities aimed at British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nSchoolchildren take part in a student climate march in Parliament Square.

I can use this.'\u201d\n\nAccording to the Italian agricultural association Coldiretti, the country wastes an estimated 30 million tons of dairy each year.\n\nClothing made from milk protein by Tuscany-based company, Duedillatte. Catie Monteiro / NBC News\n\nBellina's Tuscany-based company Duedilatte collects the expired product from local farms.\n\nOne T-shirt takes less than half a gallon of milk to make. The final product is enticingly soft, and crucially, doesn\u2019t smell like sour milk.\n\nThe transformation begins with the milk heated to exactly 122 degrees Fahrenheit. Next, citric acid is added to separate the whey from the protein. At this stage, it looks and smells just like old, lumpy milk you might find at the back of the fridge.\n\nThe casein protein is then strained, dried and ground into powder. The next step is a trade secret, but Bellina could reveal that a machine described as \u201ca giant cotton candy spinner\u201d whips the powder into a fiber. Finally, it\u2019s twisted into thread and woven into fabric.\n\n\u201cThe first thing people do is smell it,\u201d Bellina said, laughing.\n\nMilk fiber isn\u2019t new. It was invented in the 1930s as a replacement for wool in fascist Benito Mussolini's resource-starved Italy. But early prototypes were chemical-heavy, with factories using substances like formaldehyde to strengthen the fabric. Bellina said technological advancements have allowed her to revolutionize this process.\n\n\u201cOur fabric is now 100 percent chemical-free,\" she added. \"Even our dyes are from natural sources like blueberries and red onion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the fashion industry is responsible for producing 20 percent of global waste-water and 10 percent of global carbon emissions \u2014 more than that of international flights and maritime shipping combined. The industry is now considered one of the worst polluters in the world and experts say there\u2019s an urgent need to develop eco-friendly alternatives.\n\nDuedilatte produces fabric as well as T-shirts and baby outfits, which cost around $50 and $30 respectively.\n\nWhile the young company has seen steady growth, Bellina says it has yet to make a profit. However, she plans to expand into bedding and even medical products like bandages.\n\nAt the moment, Duedilatte\u2019s range is only available in Italy but the company hopes to enter the global market later this year.\n\nProf. Kate Fletcher, who specializes in sustainability at the London College of Fashion, described casein fiber as a \"really interesting step in a transition period while we figure out how to handle fashion provision with less.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/inside-ukraine-s-heated-battle-against-russian-backed-separatists-1444118083509", "text": "Inside Ukraine\u2019s heated battle against Russian-backed separatists 01:56 copied!\n\nNBC\u2019s Bill Neely reports from the front lines of a deadly five-year war as the U.S.-backed Ukraine fights to survive against separatists supported by Russia.

Like his father and grandfather before him, Jenkins, 69, has faced almost every challenge, from harsh Welsh winters to constantly changing prices for his livestock.\n\nBut nothing has worried him quite like the U.K.'s impending exit from the European Union \u2014 the seemingly unsolvable riddle that is Brexit.\n\nWilliam Jenkins is a farmer in Blaenau Gwent, the county in Wales with the highest percentage of voters who backed leaving the E.U. in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Ziad Jaber / NBC News\n\n\"I've got to be honest, politicians of all colors are playing political games with our future and it frightens me what is going to happen to us,\" he says, squinting into the low, wintry sun.\n\nAccording to Jenkins, the E.U. has given farmers \"stability and security.\"\n\nMore than two and a half years after Brits voted in a referendum to leave the E.U., and with only weeks to go until the divorce is due to come through, the country's politicians still haven't agreed how to make this work. NBC News embarked on a road trip to speak with regular people around the country about their hopes and fears for the future.\n\nIf they can't agree on something by March 29, Britain will face a \"no-deal\" Brexit, risking shortages of food and medicine, chaos at the borders and conflict in Northern Ireland.\n\nWith much of the debate centered around Parliament, we wanted to escape the \"Westminster bubble\" \u2014 the British version of the so-called Washington Beltway.\n\nWe traveled 1,200 miles by car, train and airplane, visiting both pro-E.U. and \"leave\" heartlands in each of the U.K.'s four nations: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nWe met Jenkins, the Welsh sheep farmer, while visiting Blaenau Gwent, the county in Wales with the highest percentage of voters who supported quitting the 28-country bloc in the 2016 referendum.\n\nAs one of the poorest parts of Europe, Wales receives hundreds of millions of dollars each year in E.U. funding. And yet most people here voted to leave.\n\nMany complained that despite the influx of cash, it was being spent on new highways and urban face-lifts, rather than things that might immediately improve their lives. This once mighty industrial region is blighted by unemployment and rust-belt isolation.\n\nAs a pro-E.U. remainer, Jenkins goes against the grain of his community and says he's \"baffled\" by the vote.\n\nOn another leg of the trip, we found his polar opposite in the Northern Irish coastal town of Ballycastle.\n\n\"Westminster has lost touch with the people and they have lost touch with democracy,\" said dock worker David Henry, 59, speaking about the lawmakers at the Parliament in London.\n\nDavid Henry Ziad Jaber / NBC News\n\n\"We voted leave, overwhelmingly, to get out of Europe \u2014 and we want out,\" he added, referring to the 17.4 million people across the U.K. \u2014 or 52 percent of voters \u2014 who supported departing.\n\nAlthough the majority of Northern Ireland voters \u2014 55.8 percent \u2014 wanted to stay in the E.U., Henry lives in North Antrim, the area with the region's strongest leave vote. Like many, his main concern is immigration \u2014 \"the flood of cheap, foreign labor coming into this country.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland has become a major sticking point for Brexit. It was plagued for 30 years by sectarian strife called \"the Troubles.\" A 1998 peace deal rested on an open border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Some worry Brexit could mean the return of a \"hard border,\" and with it violence.\n\nHenry dismissed these fears as \"lies and propaganda bred by people who want to remain.\"\n\nBut in Londonderry, also known as Derry, we found a different view. It lies miles from the border with the Irish Republic, which will remain part of the E.U., and would be on the front line of any tension post-Brexit.\n\n\"There were bombs or shootings at least four or five times a week,\" said Gavin Morrison, 46, recalling growing up during the Troubles and working for a window firm.\n\n\"We put in a lot of panes of glass on a Friday,\" he said near the city's E.U.-funded Peace Bridge. \"There was another bomb on the Sunday that blew them out again, and we had to replace them again on the Monday.\"\n\nGavin Morrison Ziad Jaber / NBC News\n\nLondonderry is in the parliamentary constituency of Foyle, which boasted the highest level of support for staying in the bloc of any place outside of London.\n\nWe found a similar sentiment in Scotland, where 62 percent of voters backed staying in the E.U.\n\nJamie McCormack, 37, a chef, told us over a pint in Edinburgh that he was angry at being \"dragged out of the European Union\" as a result of votes that came mostly from England.\n\n\"My country did not vote to come out of the European Union,\" he said. \"England took us out; we didn't vote for this.\"\n\nAnother stop was the English town of Boston \u2014 which is where the Massachusetts city got its name. The U.K.'s version happens to be the Brexit capital of the U.K., where almost 80 percent of residents voted to leave the E.U. Many were motivated by a spike in immigration from Eastern Europe after 10 new countries joined the bloc in 2004.\n\n\"It was such a stable community for such a long time before the introduction of free movement,\" said Alan Mason, 69.\n\nHe wouldn't say how he voted in 2016, and he denied that anti-immigrant sentiment was a cover for thinly veiled racism. He told us he understood why people were upset that the \"character\" of the town had changed so quickly.\n\nOthers weren't so measured. While we were filming in the main square, a man shouted to us, \"Send them all back home,\" referring to the town's migrant population.\n\nIt's no surprise Britain is divided over Brexit. But we found surprising shades of gray.\n\nIn the town of Lossiemouth, on Scotland's freezing north coast, Sandra Campbell, 64, admitted that in 2016 there wasn't enough information \"for people to come to a proper decision\" on the referendum.\n\nAnd even in the pro-E.U. stronghold of Lambeth in South London, management consultant Simon Sandberg, 61, recognized there could be \"a political crisis\" if the result were overturned.\n\nThat didn't stop him from adding one hopeful caveat, with a glint in his eye.\n\n\"Well, I'm not sure we are about to leave the European Union,\" he said, amid speculation that the parliamentary gridlock in London might prompt another referendum on the issue. \"That's still up for grabs.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/javad-zarif-warns-it-would-be-suicidal-go-war-iran-n971931", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He said it was possible this was because of a sabotage campaign by the U.S. as suggested by a New York Times report this week.\n\nHe said that Iran had already been investigating these failures but was now \"looking into the specifics\" because of the article in The Times.\n\n\"It's quite possible. We don't know yet,\" he said of a possible U.S. sabotage campaign. \"We need to look into it very carefully.\"\n\nZarif's comments came a day after Vice President Mike Pence accused Iran of pursuing \"another Holocaust,\" while criticizing European allies for trying to undercut U.S. sanctions against the country.\n\nEarlier in the week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a statement that was translated by his office as urging \"war with Iran.\" Israeli officials tried to soften the reference by altering the English translation, but it nonetheless startled Iranians and even the White House.\n\nNBC News' Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel interviews Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Richard Greenberg / NBC News\n\nPence and Netanyahu attended an international conference the U.S. organized in Warsaw on Thursday. Meanwhile, Iran, Russia and NATO member Turkey met at a rival summit in the Russian city of Sochi to discuss the war in Syria.\n\nThe U.S.-led conference in Warsaw was initially intended to coalesce support around Washington's desire to contain Iran, but the event was later broadened to cover the wider Middle East after some countries balked at the initial pitch, three foreign diplomats told NBC News.\n\nZarif said the Warsaw meeting was a \"huge failure\" because it showed, according to him, how \"totally, totally isolated in the world\" the U.S. has become over Iran.\n\nAsked whether Iran was open to revisiting the 2015 nuclear deal, Zarif said he saw no reason to do this because the original agreement was so complex and painstakingly negotiated.\n\n\"The nuclear deal was the result of 13 years of negotiations,\" he said. \"We produced not the two-page document that President Trump signed with the chairman of North Korea but a 150-page document,\" he added, referring to Trump's accord with North Korea's Kim Jong Un last year that was widely criticized for being too brief and vague.\n\nZarif pointed to agreements the Trump administration has pulled out of, such as the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\n\"You name it, they've withdrawn from it,\" he said.\n\nThough supportive of the nuclear deal, the European Union last month slapped sanctions on Iran's Intelligence and Security Ministry and two Iranian nationals over allegations of orchestrating assassinations and thwarted terror plots on European soil.\n\nOn Friday, Zarif reiterated Iran's previous denials of this charge. \"If you look at those allegations you will see false flags everywhere,\" he said.\n\nAnother source of friction between the West and Iran is Syria, where Tehran is allied with the regime of President Bashar al Assad as well as Russia. The U.S. and much of the West and the Sunni Arab world have opposed Assad since a 2011 pro-democracy movement morphed into an armed revolt against the Syrian government.\n\nA number of countries, including the U.S., became involved in Syria after Islamic State extremists captured swaths of the country in 2014.\n\nThe U.S. is planning to withdraw its 2,000 troops within months because ISIS has lost most of its territory there while remaining a dangerous, scattered force.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the pro-Syria coalition is declaring victory, Zarif said.\n\n\"Everybody lost, the people of Syria lost,\" he said. But \"most of the bloodshed has ended, and that's a major accomplishment.\"\n\nHe called on the U.S. and the rest of the world to support the summit in Sochi, calling it \"the only peace game in town.\"\n\n\"I hope the rest of the world will come to realize that our gain will not be their loss, if we gain in ending this war,\" he said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-u-s-allies-europe-take-back-800-captured-n972541", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Not all Westerners who joined the group were fighters and the depth of their involvement isn't always clear.\n\nEarlier in the week the news that British teen Shamima Begum was now pregnant in a refugee camp and asking to come home after running away to Syria in 2015 to join ISIS set off a fierce public debate over whether she and others like her can be rehabilitated.\n\nThe news Sunday that Begum had now reportedly given birth to the baby, from whom she had pleaded not to be separated if she does return to Britain, could further complicate matters.\n\n\"Somebody who has spent a lot of time in the caliphate is likely to be radicalized, and women are as capable of committing terrorist acts as men,\" said NBC News security analyst Duncan Gardham of Begum. \"It may be a difficult task to make sure she is not radicalized and ensure that she's not a threat.\"\n\nFor those who did commit crimes, there are considerations to be made of where to incarcerate them \u2014 without risking radicalizing other inmates \u2014 and what to do with them upon their release, Shiraz Maher, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, at Kings College London, said in a tweet thread on Thursday."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/turkey-increasingly-looks-russia-iran-protect-its-interests-n971571", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But the conflict in Syria has opened up the most dramatic divide between the two countries, with Ankara infuriated at Washington's support for Kurdish forces in Syria, which it sees as a terrorist threat.\n\nWhen national security adviser John Bolton flew to Ankara in January, Erdogan refused to meet him and expressed outrage at U.S. demands that Turkey refrain from launching strikes against Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria.\n\nCivilians wait at a makeshift checkpoint after fleeing ISIS from the Syrian city of Bagouz on Feb. 9, 2019. Chris McGrath / Getty Images\n\n\"We cannot swallow . . . the message that Bolton gave in Israel,\" the Turkish president said, and added that Bolton \"probably doesn't know\" the difference between ethnic Kurds and armed Kurdish groups.\n\nWith the U.S. planning to withdraw its small contingent of 2,000 troops in Syria within months, Turkey has recognized for some time it must reach an accommodation with Russia and Iran to safeguard its interests in Syria, experts said.\n\n\"The real power brokers in Syria are Iran and Russia,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, a former senior official under the Obama administration and now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.\n\nThe three countries meeting in Sochi have emerged as the dominant players in what appears to be the final phase of the Syrian civil war. Russia and Iran came to the aid of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and have succeeded in turning the tide of the conflict in Assad's favor.\n\nA Syrian Democratic Forces fighter stands guard on a rooftop after retaking the city of Raqqa from ISIS fighters on Oct. 20, 2017. Bulent Kilic / AFP/Getty Images file\n\nTurkey cultivated Islamist rebel groups opposed to Assad that have been beaten back for the most part. But Russia and Iran need Turkey's help in squelching the rebels in their last strongholds in the northern province of Idlib, and Ankara needs Russian and Iranian cooperation to ensure Kurdish forces are kept in check and to pave the way for Syrian refugees to return, former U.S. diplomats said.\n\n\"I am confident that our trilateral summit on Syria will provide a new impulse toward stabilization in this country,\" Putin said before the talks began in Sochi.\n\nIn discussions with Ankara, U.S. officials have revived the idea of a protected \"buffer zone\" for the Kurds in the northeast, but Erdogan has said any such area would have to be coordinated with Russia.\n\nWhen an uprising erupted in Syria in 2011, Erdogan had hoped to see Assad fall. But Turkey has since come to accept that Assad is firmly in place, and that the Syrian regime's patrons \u2014 Russia and Iran \u2014 will be needed to prevent a Kurdish state forming on Turkey's southern border, said Aykan Erdemir, a member of the Turkish parliament from 2011-2015.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks to the media at the parliament in Ankara on Jan. 8, 2019. Burhan Ozbilici / AP\n\n\"Turkey realizes it has lost in Syria. And the Kurdish issue has always been the top priority for Turkey,\" said Erdemir, now a fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a hawkish think tank. And that \"means you have to work with Russia,\" he said.\n\nAs U.N. peace talks on Syria foundered in recent years despite backing from the United States, Turkey joined up with Russia and Iran for an alternative peace process that soon overshadowed the U.N. effort, a result that made the United States look impotent, foreign diplomats and experts said.\n\nAt a moment when Turkey's fragile economy is plagued by debt and inflation, Ankara is anxious to retain close economic cooperation with Moscow, as it relies on gas supplies from Russia and revenues from Russian tourists and from Turkish contractors in Russia, Erdemir said. After a Russian fighter jet was downed by Turkey in November 2015, Moscow banned charter vacation trips to the country, dealing a severe blow to Turkey's tourism industry.\n\nErdogan also sees Russia as an important alternative source for weapons. Ankara has ignored warnings from two successive U.S. administrations against buying the Russian-made S-400 missile system and Turkish officials say they plan to wrap up the purchase later this year.\n\nMusa, a 25-year-old Kurdish marksman, stands atop a building as he looks at the destroyed Syrian town of Kobane, also known as Ain al-Arab, on Jan. 30, 2015.

Bulent Kilic / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nTurkey is not alone in seeking to cultivate Russia, as other U.S. partners in the Middle East \u2014 including Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates \u2014 see Moscow as stepping into a vacuum left by the U.S., offering arms and energy deals.\n\n\"Everybody in the region is looking at Russia,\" Goldenberg said. \"With their relatively small intervention in Syria, they were basically were able to turn the tide in a regional war.\"\n\nLike Russia, Turkey has opposed the Trump administration's hardline on Iran, and Erdogan has threatened to defy the U.S. sanctions reimposed on Tehran, calling them an \"imperial\" policy. During the last round of sanctions that preceded the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, Turkey was accused of turning a blind eye to sanctions busting.\n\nThe Trump administration last year granted Turkey an exemption to allow it to purchase oil from Iran, though at lower levels. But it remains clear if the White House is ready to renew the waiver to Ankara later this year.\n\nErdogan's harsh treatment of political opponents, journalists and other critics, along with his preference for an Islamist political model at the expense of the country's secular traditions, has put him at odds with the United States and the European Union. But he has dismissed Western objections, and his supporters point out that the democracies of Europe refused to open the door to Turkey's request for EU membership for years.\n\nTurkey has also bristled at America's close embrace of Riyadh, opposing Saudi Arabia's embargo on Qatar while competing with the kingdom to serve as the region's leading Sunni power.\n\nWhen the Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul in October, Erdogan's government leaked out damning details of the incident, forcing Riyadh to revise its official explanation more than once. \"Turkey saw an opportunity to embarrass the Saudis, to gain leverage,\" Goldenberg said.\n\nSo far, Turkey has yet to pay a serious price for its disagreements with Washington and European powers. Congress has threatened to sanction Turkey if it goes ahead with acquiring the Russian-made S-400 missiles, and Trump threatened to imposed sanctions if Ankara crushed the Kurds in Syria. But Erdogan has calculated that the United States is not ready to hit its old ally hard with punitive measures, experts said.\n\n\"I think he believes he has impunity in relations with the EU and the U.S., \" Erdemir said of the Turkish president. \"Erdogan knows that Putin will push back, Iran will push back, but not the U.S.\"\n\nTurkey has even sought to undercut the United States in Latin America, refusing to back U.S.-led sanctions on Venezuela and opposing Washington's effort to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido. A month after the Trump administration granted an exemption for Ankara to allow it to continue to import Iranian oil, Erdogan paid a visit to Venezuela in December to lend his support to the regime of President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"That's pretty extraordinary,\" said Eric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey now with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank. \"It's impossible to imagine any previous Turkish leader doing that.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/art-imitates-life-when-it-comes-brexit-s-impact-romance-n965151", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

More than 3 million E.U. nationals live in the U.K., according to government figures.\n\nBeauvais, who is originally from Paris and now teaches education at England's University of York, said she did not want \"Brexit Romance\" to be a one-sided story.\n\nCl\u00e9mentine Beauvais\n\n\"It's so easy to portray 'leavers' as bad people and 'remainers' as good people,\" she said. \"There are actually lots of reasons to vote 'leave.' It's a reaction to the fact that Brits have been taught to see Britain as exceptional. In France, you are taught to identify as a European from a very young age, or you see European flags everywhere, but you never see that in Britain.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a two-story mural in the Walthamstow district of London voices Europe's response to Brexit \u2014 and bids a poignant farewell to the U.K.\n\n\"Gracias por su visita\" \u2014 or \"Thank you for your visit\" \u2014 is a work by the Spanish street artist known as Ampparito.\n\nIt features those words on a simple napkin, an object found in every bar in Spain.\n\n\"Gracias por su visita\" or \"Thank you for your visit\" is a mural by Spanish street artist Ampparito.

In 2016, a British woman, Tareena Shakil, 26, was jailed for six years for taking her young son to Syria and joining ISIS.\n\nIf there is evidence, Begum could be arrested for joining a banned terror group, or for merely deliberately staying in what the British government calls a \"designated area\" \u2014 essentially a war zone like Syria.\n\nEven if she is classified as a noncombatant, the importance of her merely being in Syria should not be dismissed, Maher said.\n\nTheir presence in ISIS territory alone represented \"a type of moral and propaganda victory for the group,\" he tweeted. \"Don't underestimate how important that was.\"\n\nBut whatever you think, there is very little public sympathy for those who voluntarily migrated to Islamic State.

Morally, there has already been a wide public disagreement in Britain about whether Begum can and should be rehabilitated back into society.\n\nIn 2015, she was widely portrayed as the 15-year-old victim of online brainwashing, someone who needed to be saved from the clutches of a murderous death-cult.\n\nNow, her unapologetic interview in The Times has led many to say that she should be left to her own fate.\n\nSecurity minister Ben Wallace pointed out that as a British citizen Begum had the right to return to the U.K. However he said she would at least be investigated by counterterror police and suggested that the public\u2019s safety would take priority.\n\n\"I'm not putting at risk British people's lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state,\" he said on BBC radio early Thursday.\n\nBritish teenagers Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum walking with luggage at Gatwick Airport, south of London, on Feb. 17, 2015.

The data, released on Wednesday by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), shows that 2018 was the fourth-hottest year since 1880, the earliest year for which reliable global temperature data is available.\n\nThe three hottest years on record were 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\n\"In fact, the warmest five years in the record are just the last five years,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, and one of the experts who described the new data in a Wednesday morning press briefing, told NBC News MACH in an email before the event. \"The long-term trends toward warmer temperatures are clear and continuing.\"\n\nThe average global surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the 1880s, NASA data showed. NOAA, which uses different baselines and analyzes the data differently, found that global temperatures in 2018 were 1.42 degrees F (0.79 degrees C) above the 20th century average.\n\nThis line plot shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2018. NASA's Earth Observatory\n\nThe new report makes it clear that \"global warming shows no sign of slowing down or stopping,\" Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an email.\n\nBecause weather patterns vary around the world, not every region experienced the same warming trend. Trends were strongest in the polar regions, which have seen continued loss of sea ice in the Arctic and shrinkage of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nIn the contiguous U.S., 2018 was the 14th hottest year on record. Fourteen states had annual temperatures that were among the 10 highest on record. Arizona's temperatures in 2018 were the second highest on record, New Mexico's the third and California's fourth.\n\nRainfall also trended upward in 2018. NOAA data showed that the average precipitation in the contiguous U.S. was 34.63 inches, making it the wettest year in the past 35 years and the third-wettest since record-keeping began in 1895. While some parts of the country saw drier-than-normal years, nine eastern states \u2014 Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia \u2014 experienced their wettest years on record.\n\nThe temperature data was gathered by thousands of weather stations around the world and then analyzed to correct for any skewing of data that might be caused by the proximity of heat-producing urban areas or other conditions.\n\nThere's broad agreement among scientists that global warming is caused principally by human activity. In particular, the burning of fossil fuels boosts atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which raise temperatures by trapping heat from the sun that otherwise would flow into space. Coal-burning power plants are the biggest polluters in the U.S., followed by exhaust-spewing cars, trucks and other gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\n\"It will continue to warm, not necessarily year by year, but in the long term, until we get emissions under control,\" Schmidt said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's well-known skepticism of climate science notwithstanding, the U.S. populace is starting to catch up with scientists. A new poll shows that 74 percent of Americans now believe global warming is real, with 62 percent saying human activity is the cause.\n\nIf the cause of global warming is now well established, so are its effects.\n\n\"We can see it in sea level rise and increased coastal flooding, increased heat waves, intense precipitation events, melting ice in the Arctic, mountain glaciers across the world, and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica,\" Schmidt said. \"The potential threat of more warming is ever-clearer changes that will reach to wildfires, droughts, storm surge and tropical storm intensity.\"\n\nIn 2018, there were 14 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion, according to NOAA. These included Hurricanes Florence and Michael as well as the California wildfires.\n\nExperts say high temperatures are also beginning to exact a number of societal costs, including reduced labor productivity and disruptions of the food supply, along with health problems ranging from a longer, more intense allergy season to an increased incidence of insect-borne diseases.\n\n\"Society might not collapse in the next few decades due to climate change, but we are learning more and more about what it will look like,\" Amir Jina, an environmental economist at the University of Chicago, said in an email. As days get hotter, he said, people \"use more energy to cool ... work less, and are less effective at work, and food production, especially in the eastern half of the country, can see yield declines of around 50 percent\" by the end of the century.\n\n\"The majority of people on this planet have never experienced a month when the global average temperature was below the historical average,\" Dahl said in the email. \"And most teenagers have lived almost their entire lives during years of record-breaking temperatures. The continuation of these trends puts the well-being of our planet and all its inhabitants at risk.\"\n\nWant more stories about the environment?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/donald-tusk-says-some-brexiteers-deserve-special-place-hell-n968226", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Tusk admitted Wednesday that this no longer seemed possible.\n\n\u201cToday, there is no political force and no effective leadership for remain. I say this without satisfaction but you can\u2019t argue with the facts,\u201d he said.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May. Liam McBurney / Getty Images\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to meet with Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Thursday to discuss a way forward on the divorce agreement.\n\nLast month, the deal she negotiated with the E.U. was crushed by members of Parliament, including more than one-third of lawmakers from her own Conservative Party.\n\nOne of the main objections to the deal is an insurance policy of sorts known as the Irish backstop. It aims to prevent the reintroduction of a physical border between the Irish Republic, which will remain in the E.U., and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K. and will leave the bloc March 29.\n\nFor 30 years, starting in the late 1960s, the border was a frontline in a conflict known as \"The Troubles\" that killed 3,600 people. Some fear Britain's plan to leave the E.U. could result in checkpoints being reintroduced there, which could potentially spur new violence.\n\nEuropean leaders, however, have been clear that the Brexit agreement is not up for renegotiation. Tusk said that he hoped May would come with \u201ca realistic suggestion\u201d on how to end the impasse.\n\nWith only 51 days to go until the U.K. leaves the bloc, Tusk said that the E.U.\u2019s most important task now was to prepare for \u201ca possible fiasco\u201d in which Britain departs with no divorce agreement and no arrangements for future trade.\n\nIn a \"no-deal\" Brexit, the Bank of England has warned the country's economy could shrink by as much as 8 percent in about a year.\n\nBusinesses, pharmaceutical companies and supermarkets have already started stockpiling goods. Supermarkets have also warned that fresh produce such as lettuce and tomatoes may be difficult to get in the event a deal isn't reached, as much of their supply in March comes from the E.U.\n\nShould any agreement not win enough support from lawmakers in Parliament, the U.K. could potentially request to delay Brexit \u2014 or even decide not to leave."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/new-trump-rules-make-it-easier-u-s-gun-makers-n968601", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFeb. 7, 2019, 10:59 AM GMT By Josh Lederman\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Semi-automatic weapons, flamethrowers and even some grenades will become easier for U.S. weapons manufacturers to export overseas under new rules being put in place by the Trump administration and obtained by NBC News.\n\nUnder the new rules, set to take effect in just under a month, gun-makers will no longer need licenses from the Department of State to sell dozens of types of weapons to other countries, including semi-automatic assault weapons such as the AR-15 that has been employed in many of America\u2019s worst mass shootings. Instead, sellers will need only a no-fee license from the Department of Commerce, which has a less onerous licensing process and a smaller global footprint, making it harder to track how the weapons are ultimately used overseas.\n\nThe new rules come as efforts to strengthen gun control in the United States, a key priority in the Obama administration, have stalled under President Donald Trump despite continued mass shootings. Democrats have signaled they plan to use their newfound control of the House of Representatives to revisit the issue, starting with a House Judiciary Committee hearing held Wednesday \u2014 the first in about eight years.\n\nThe Trump administration first floated the changes last year, rejuvenating a campaign to simplify export rules that had been contemplated by the administration of President Barack Obama but then dropped after the mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012. The State Department sent the final version of the rules to key lawmakers Monday as part of the mandatory \u201ccongressional notification\u201d process. The rules will take effect 30 days later unless Congress takes the unlikely step of passing a resolution to block them.\n\nA copy of the new regulations, marked \u201cOnly for State internal use,\u201d says that supervision for exports of any semi-automatic firearms that don\u2019t use caseless ammunition will move from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The same applies to shotguns, other than those that are fully automatic.\n\nThose who want to export flamethrowers that project a stream of fire up to 20 meters (about 66 feet) will no longer need a State Department license. A new paragraph in the rules states that grenades, too, will now fall under the Commerce Department if they contain \u201cnon-lethal or less lethal projectiles.\u201d Most parts, components and ammunition for firearms are also being moved to the Commerce Department.\n\nPart of Trump\u2019s push to reduce regulations governmentwide, the new rules aim to assist American gun manufacturers by making it simpler to export products that the administration says are already \u201cwidely available for retail sale in the United States.\u201d Exports of weapons deemed to have an \u201cinherently military function\u201d or to provide the U.S. with a military advantage will remain controlled by the State Department.\n\nBut gun control advocates and many Democrats have voiced concerns about the proliferation of weapons in places where, unlike the United States, deadly weapons aren\u2019t readily available at sporting goods stores or retailers like Walmart.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, it is much more difficult to obtain any kind of firearm, much less a semi-automatic rifle or a flamethrower,\u201d said John Lindsay-Poland, a gun trafficking expert at the human rights group Global Exchange. \u201cIn a context where such weapons aren\u2019t available to ordinary people, they become weapons of war, whether we\u2019re talking about insurgencies or terrorist organizations or organized crime. They use those weapons to control territory, carry out acts against civilians and to contest state power.\u201d\n\nThe changes also mean that sales of less than $1 million in arms will not require advance notification to Congress, which allows lawmakers a period of time to block a potential sale. That process has in the past been used to stop sales of firearms to countries of concern.\n\nIn 2017, opposition from lawmakers thwarted a Trump administration proposal to let Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s bodyguards buy $1.2 million in U.S. guns, following violence against protesters during his visit to Washington, D.C. A similar process stopped the U.S. from selling tens of thousands of assault weapons to the Philippines\u2019 national police in 2016.\n\nUnder the new rules, exporting guns will also cost less. Unlike the State Department, which charges an annual $2,240 fee for licenses to export firearms, the Commerce Department's licensing process doesn\u2019t require a fee.\n\nAlthough some Democratic opposition is expected to the new rules, they are likely to take effect anyway. New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate\u2019s foreign relations panel, plans to put a hold on the rules, The New York Times has reported. But to block the rules permanently, Congress would have to pass a resolution disapproving them, a maneuver that has been rarely attempted and even less frequently successful.\n\nA State Department official, speaking anonymously because the final rules haven\u2019t been publicly released, stressed that all firearm exports will still be monitored by the U.S. government, via the Commerce Department.\n\nThe official said the changes would \u201csignificantly reduce the regulatory burden on the U.S. commercial firearms and ammunition industry, promote American exports, and clarify the regulatory requirements for independent gunsmiths, while at the same time prioritizing national security controls and continuing our ability to restrict exports where human rights, illicit trafficking, and related issues may be of concern.\u201d\n\nIn public comments submitted to the Federal Register after the Trump administration first proposed the rules in May, the National Rifle Association voiced its support, arguing that the Commerce Department is fully capable of regulating gun exports.\n\nStill, the Institute for Legislative Action \u2014 the gun group\u2019s lobbying arm \u2014 encouraged the administration to tweak the rules by removing even more categories of items from the State Department\u2019s control, including silencers and high-capacity magazines.\n\n\u201cThe NRA believes that, on the whole, the proposal correctly balances the imperatives of national and global security, allocation of oversight resources, and promotion of American industry, innovation, and competiveness,\u201d Christopher Zealand, the group\u2019s senior research attorney. wrote.\n\nYet many of the almost 3,000 comments received by the government argued against the easing of the export rules, warning of the risk of increasing gun trafficking and needlessly enriching the gun manufacturing industry.\n\n\u201cTo cite just a few reasons, it will make it easier for dictators, organized crime, and terrorists to obtain guns in large quantities,\u201d one of them, Marilyn Guterman, commented. \u201cPlease, in the name of peace and sanity do not allow this to happen.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/venezuela-s-maduro-blocks-much-needed-aid-from-u-s-1438457923566", "text": "Venezuela\u2019s Maduro blocks much-needed aid from U.S. 01:00 copied!\n\nThe embattled leader called the aid from the U.S. Yankee imperialism intended to humiliate Venezuela.

Marie-Dominique Philippe and other priests.\n\nLong an open secret in the Catholic Church, the issue of sexual abuse of nuns was dragged into the open by the #MeToo movement and the reporting of the Associated Press and other news organizations that found cases of nuns being abused in Europe, Africa, South America and Asia.\n\nIn November, the International Union of Superiors General, which represents all the world's female Catholic religious orders, publicly denounced the \"culture of silence and secrecy\" that prevented nuns from speaking out. It also urged nuns to report abuse to both the police and their superiors.\n\nJust last week, the women's magazine of the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, pointed blame toward the all-powerful and all-male clergy.\n\nMeanwhile, the magazine, \"Women Church World,\" reported allegations that some nuns who were impregnated by priests were forced to have abortions, which the Roman Catholic church considers a major sin.\n\nAttorney Mitchell Garabedian, whose efforts to bring down pedophile priests were dramatized in the Oscar-winning movie \u201cSpotlight,\u201d said he hopes Francis will \"provide the public with all documents concerning the sexual slavery of nuns and children for the sake of healing and morality.\"\n\n\"Given the extensive sexual slavery of minor children which has existed in the Catholic church for decades upon decades, it should come as no surprise that nuns are also sex slaves of priests,\" he said in a statement. \"The sexual slavery of nuns and of children are crimes against humanity.\"\n\nHow big the problem of sexual abuse of nuns is remains unclear.\n\nVictims are reluctant to report abuse because of fears they won\u2019t be believed, the AP reported.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFeb. 2, 2019, 11:04 AM GMT By Saphora Smith\n\nLONDON \u2014 With every new storm-tossed rescue ship that hauls drowning migrants out of the Mediterranean Sea, European governments are becoming increasingly reluctant to throw open their ports.\n\nThe distinction between \"genuine\" refugees and economic migrants is being seized upon as countries, weary of playing the good Samaritan, are now pushing to prevent asylum-seekers from reaching their soil in the first place.\n\nItaly and Malta have closed their harbors to rescue ships and are demanding that other European countries share the responsibility or that migrants are taken to ports in places like Tunisia instead. Migrants must claim asylum in the first European Union country they reach. That means the nations closest to conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa have been forced to cope with the biggest proportion of new arrivals.\n\nSince last summer, Italy has also clamped down on humanitarian operations by detaining rescue vessels on charges ranging from illegally aiding migrants to not being properly registered. That has resulted in fewer boats searching for people in distress \u2014 with no rescue vessels sometimes operating in the central Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe language used by some governments to refer to asylum-seekers has also been shifting in recent months.\n\nItalian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who also serves as interior minister and who is a member of an anti-immigration populist party, has railed against \"fake refugees.\"\n\nSajid Javid, Britain's interior minister, last month questioned whether people attempting to cross the English Channel from France to the U.K. were \u201cgenuine\u201d refugees.\n\n\u201cYou are coming from France, which is a safe country. In almost every case you are claiming asylum in the U.K. but if you were a real, genuine asylum-seeker then you could have done that in another safe country,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nIn recent days, Italy refused to allow migrants to disembark after being picked up in the Mediterranean Sea by the Dutch-flagged Sea-Watch 3 rescue ship. For 10 days, 47 people were forced to wait for a European country to blink first and open its ports.\n\nThe standoff ended this week when eight countries \u2014 including Italy \u2014 agreed to take in the migrants.\n\nMigrants spent more than a week aboard the Sea-Watch 3 waiting for a European country to open its ports and accept them. Guglielmo Mangiapane / Reuters\n\nHowever, the breakthrough came only after the Netherlands refused an Italian request to accept the ship. Italy is responsible for handling asylum claims for migrants who reach its territorial waters, but in the past the Netherlands and other countries have taken, on a case-by-case basis, some of those aboard ships refused harbor.\n\nThe Netherlands also said there was a need to distinguish between genuine refugees and economic migrants.\n\n\u201cThose who are not entitled to protection must be refused and returned immediately after arriving at the European external border,\u201d Dutch Migration Minister Mark Harbers said in a statement.\n\nBut by closing its ports to rescue vessels, Italy creates a conundrum about who will take them in. On each occasion so far, either one state has come forward or the E.U. has cobbled together a coalition of nations prepared to accept them.\n\nBut experts say the Netherlands isn't the only European government losing patience with Italy\u2019s refusal to take in migrants rescued from the Mediterranean.\n\nThe leaders of other E.U. countries are becoming reluctant to hand Salvini \"a win\" in terms of his populist agenda, according to Luigi Scazzieri, a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, a pro-European think tank based in London.\n\nDomestic politics is also playing a role as far-right and anti-immigrant views gain ground across much of the continent.\n\nNando Sigona, a researcher in migration at the University of Birmingham in England, said the Netherlands' request to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants at the edge of the continent illustrated the hardening attitude toward newcomers across Europe.\n\n\u201cThere is more and more emphasis that those who travel to Europe are economic migrants, as if they were real asylum-seekers they would have stayed in the conflict region and claimed asylum\u201d in the first safe country they arrived in, Sigona said.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, a refugee is someone who is \u201cunable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted\u201d and has the right to asylum in another country.\n\nAn economic migrant is generally considered to be someone who leaves their country in search of work or a higher standard of living, not to flee persecution.\n\nIn a three-year period ending in 2017, 2.66 million people claimed asylum for the first time in the E.U. \u2014 with 1.4 million given the status, or around 53 percent.\n\nMichael Collyer, an expert in migration at the University of Sussex in England, said the Netherlands, in deciding to stop accepting migrants who under E.U. law should be dealt with by Italy, was sending Rome a message.\n\n\u201cThe European external border is Italy,\u201d Collyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s Italy\u2019s responsibility, that it\u2019s nothing to do with the Netherlands.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/isis-still-acute-threat-u-s-interpol-chief-says-n966021", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Alfredo Estrella / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nA total of 56 prosecution witnesses were called to the stand, telling stories that at times echoed a Shakespearean drama and at others detailed a Sinaloa cartel bloodbath.\n\nThe case is expected to go to the jury on Monday. It will be up to the seven women and five men to decide whether Guzman, 61, is guilty of trafficking more than 440,000 pounds of cocaine, laundering millions of dollars and conspiring to murder a slew of rivals.\n\nThe trial, held under unprecedented security at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, New York, delivered on its promise of exposing Guzman's legendary ruthlessness and cunning.\n\nThere were tales of cold-blooded murders, lessons on how the cartel waterproofed cocaine packages and cinematic descriptions of how he narrowly escaped police dragnets.\n\nThe witnesses' nicknames \u2014 Lollipop, The Fat One, The Godfather \u2014 were in some cases as colorful as the testimony itself.\n\nOne of them, a longtime Guzman bodyguard known as \"Mem\u00edn,\" described seeing his boss end a man's life in especially gruesome fashion.\n\nThe rival cartel member was first tortured for days, the witness said, burned with a clothing iron and left to suffer in a hen house until workers began complaining about the smell.\n\n\"He was pretty much decomposing,\" said the former bodyguard, whose real name is Isaias Valde Rios.\n\nGuzman ordered his men to dig a grave. Then the blindfolded captive was brought before the Sinaloa cartel leader, Rios said.\n\nGuzman yelled at the man, grabbed a gun and shot him, Rios said. The victim was still \"gasping for air\" when he was tossed into the hole in the ground and buried under a pile of dirt, Rios said.\n\nThe trial took a particularly riveting turn when former Colombian cocaine kingpin Juan Carlos Ram\u00edrez Abad\u00eda walked up to the stand to testify against Guzman.

Near the end of the prosecution's case, Alejandro Edda, the actor who plays Guzman on the Netflix series \"Narcos: Mexico,\" walked into the courtroom.\n\nEdda later told reporters that being so close to Guzman made \"his hands sweaty\" and his \"heart beat fast.\"\n\nGuzman's former beauty-queen wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, added a layer of drama to the proceedings without saying a word.

The defense rested after 30 minutes.\n\nIn closing arguments, prosecutors told the jury an \"avalanche of evidence\" proved that Guzman lorded over a murderous drug empire. Guzman's defense countered that the government's case was a fantasy concocted by a parade of criminals who \"lie, steal, cheat, deal drugs and kill people\" for a living.\n\nGuzman spoke aloud only once during the trial, when he politely told the judge he was electing not to testify in his own defense.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or judge, me and my attorneys have spoken about this,\" Guzman said, \"and I will reserve.\"\n\nNow it's the jury's turn to do the talking."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/king-tutankhamun-tomb-conservation-work-revealed-in-luxor-egypt-1435501635535", "text": "King Tutankhamen tomb conservation work revealed in Luxor, Egypt 01:00 copied!\n\nThe 3,300-year-old tomb of King Tutankhamen has undergone a of a decade of renovation work to protect it for, and from, future visitors.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/afghans-paid-return-home-europe-have-second-thoughts-n953781", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Courtesy Mohammad Farooq Niazi\n\nNiazi, 27, is one of thousands of Afghan migrants who have been paid to return home by European governments. Austria gave him $3,100 and a one-way ticket to Kabul. The rest was up to him.\n\nMore than 400,000 Afghans lodged asylum claims in Europe for the first time from 2015 through 2017, according to European Union figures.\n\nHundreds of thousands of other migrants also arrived in E.U. countries during that period, including many fleeing conflicts, rampant corruption and extreme poverty in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nBut the number of Afghans returned by European countries to their homeland \u2014 either forcefully or voluntarily \u2014 nearly tripled, from 3,290 in 2015 to 9,460 the following year, according to Amnesty International.\n\nWhile some failed asylum-seekers are forcibly removed, others like Niazi opt for the United Nations-operated Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration program, which enables host nations to pay willing returnees to go home. (The U.S. does not fund assisted voluntary returns to any country.)\n\nThe amount of money paid by European countries to migrants under the program ranges from around $500 to $4,500 per person, according to Amnesty International.\n\nAdvocates of the measure say supporting returning migrants financially helps them to rebuild their lives. They say it also promotes reintegration, as some countries attach conditions to receiving funds such as setting up a business, enrolling in a course or renting an apartment.\n\nBut other migration experts and rights groups say the program is not truly voluntary, as often people feel they have no choice but to sign up amid the threat of being forcibly removed. Some also argue it legitimizes returns to countries that are not safe.\n\nCulture shock\n\nThe first thing Niazi noticed on disembarking from the plane last spring was the state of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very old and unprofessional in comparison to those of European countries,\u201d he said.\n\nNearly three years in Europe had changed Niazi.\n\nA woman and child beg on a sidewalk in Kabul, Afghanistan. Rahmat Gul / AP file\n\nWhile he was happy to see his mother again, Niazi said life in Afghanistan initially felt \u201cunfamiliar\u201d and the day-to-day violence weighed on his mind.\n\nHe got by on the $3,100 given to him under the U.N. program and went into business with his uncle, who is a butcher.\n\nBut after almost a year of being back in Afghanistan, Niazi says he still does not feel safe and says he plans to return to Europe with his mother and his new wife as soon as possible.\n\nOtherwise \u201cour child will be born in a place where there is no peace or stability,\u201d he said. \u201cAfghanistan is not for living or finding jobs.\u201d\n\n'Crime, terrorism, civil unrest'\n\nMany Afghans like Niazi worry about their families\u2019 safety in a country where an emboldened Taliban is fighting U.S.-led NATO forces and the government of President Ashraf Ghani.\n\nThe militants were toppled by American forces in 2001 after sheltering 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, but now hold sway over almost half of the country and are again imposing their strict version of Islam on swaths of the population.\n\nBy all accounts, security in Afghanistan is deteriorating. The first half of 2018 was the deadliest ever for Afghan civilians, with 1,700 people killed, according to a recent study commissioned by Save the Children.\n\nThe State Department also warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan due to \u201ccrime, terrorism, civil unrest and armed conflict.\u201d\n\nA recent report by Amnesty International on forced and voluntary returns to the country concluded that returns were taking place despite evidence that people \u201cface a real risk of serious human rights violations.\u201d\n\nNicola Graviano, who works for the International Organization for Migration, the U.N. body that runs the program, said it continually monitors conditions on the ground as part of the voluntary returns process.\n\nThat \"doesn't mean, though, that the situation is rosy everywhere,\" he said. \"It's a constantly evolving situation and we need to be ready to adapt and reconsider our lines.\"\n\nHe cautioned that the principles of international law \u2014 such as not forcing asylum-seekers to return to a place where they face persecution \u2014 applied when returning migrants to Afghanistan.\n\nLiza Schuster, an expert in migration policy based at City, University of London, questioned whether the U.N. program should be used to return people to a \u201ccountry in conflict\u201d like Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cFor some people who feel they have absolutely no other choice, they will take assisted voluntary return,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though the voluntary is in heavily inverted quotes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schuster, migrants are often told by officials in the West that \"if we have to force you back on a plane you won\u2019t receive anything when you arrive.\"\n\nTaking the money as part of the U.N. program can often appear to be a better answer.\n\nStarting over\n\nSaleem Paigeer, 53, has struggled to find work since opting to return from Germany last year.\n\nA father of four, Paigeer now volunteers for a political party, but has no income and is living off the $3,400 he received.\n\nWith the money running out fast, he says the family is struggling to make ends meet.\n\nSaleem Paigeer, right, says he doesn't consider his country to be safe. \"If Afghanistan is safe why are there huge walls around the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"What about all the embassies?\" Courtesy Saleem Paigeer\n\n\u201cIt is not enough for a family coming back from migration and starting life from zero.

Russia says that the U.S. Aegis missile defense system deployed in Europe could be adapted to fit treaty-violating cruise missiles.\n\nThe U.S. has for years accused Russia of violating the treaty with its Novator 9M729 missile.\n\n\"These new missiles are hard to detect, they are mobile, they are nuclear capable,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said last week, referring to Russia's 9M729. \"They can reach European cities and they reduce the warning time.\"\n\nHowever, even those experts who agree with the U.S. allegations have cautioned that ripping up the agreement carries significant risks, both for the Trump administration and the security of Europe.\n\nSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, left, and President Ronald Reagan exchange pens during the INF Treaty signing ceremony at the White House on Dec. 8, 1987.

Without it, it would be a free-for-all.\n\n\"One concern is that in the medium-term there may be the temptation to return intermediate-range missiles, potentially including nuclear weapons, to Europe,\" Karl Dewey, an analyst at Jane's by IHS Markit, told NBC News when President Donald Trump announced his intentions in October.\n\nAll this comes at a time when Trump's mixed messages have caused alarm among NATO allies about whether the president would truly commit to the principle of mutual defense if Europe were attacked.\n\n\"Accompanying any return of nuclear weapons will be the lingering concerns ... whether the U.S. would be prepared to protect its European allies in a nuclear war in the European theater \u2014 i.e. trade Boston for Berlin, Wisconsin for Warsaw,\" Dewey added.\n\nSome backed Trump's ultimatum last year, saying it might bring the Russians to the negotiating table rather than risk an arms race they could not afford.\n\nOthers wondered whether the treaty had more to do with the U.S. wanting to keep apace with China, whose weapons are not bound by the INF Treaty.\n\nJames Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the London think tank Chatham House, said that although Russia is violating the agreement, it was a mistake for the U.S. to walk away rather than try to enforce it more effectively.\n\n\"Without wishing to pass off any moral equivalence here, both sides are being very stubborn,\" he said. \"Nobody wants to make any concessions, nobody wants to admit they're wrong, nobody wants to seem to give an inch because it looks like weakness or inferiority.\"\n\nHe believes that the Trump administration should have opted for a middle ground.\n\n\"The answer isn't rolling over and letting it happen, and the answer is not walking away,\" Nixey said. \"The answer is: If you don't comply on one aspect of the treaty we will do something about it.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/when-it-comes-brexit-everyone-parliament-has-opinion-n964006", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

In the end, they demanded May return to Brussels to replace one of the more contentious parts of the agreement, known as the Irish backstop. It is an insurance policy that aims to prevent the reintroduction of a hard border between the Irish Republic, which will remain in the E.U., and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K. and will leave the bloc on March 29.\n\nThe E.U. has consistently said the departure deal it struck with May last year is not open to renegotiation.\n\nI asked the relevant EU people what the response will be when @theresa_may asks to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. All replied with just one word. It is \u201cno\u201d. This could be shortest and most hopeless renegotiation in history. \u2014 Robert Peston (@Peston) January 29, 2019\n\nAnd even if May does manage to get concessions on the deal from Brussels, there's no guarantee that British lawmakers would unite around any new proposal.\n\nThe impasse has even the most experienced political experts scratching their heads on what's to come.\n\nOn Tuesday, lawmakers also approved a proposal calling on the government to stop a potentially disorderly \"no-deal\" scenario. While it is nonbinding, it sent a signal that a majority opposes such a departure.\n\nBut unless Parliament agrees to back some sort of plan, that default position is exactly what's in store. In the event of a chaotic \"no-deal\" Brexit, the Bank of England has warned the economy could shrink by as much as 8 percent in about a year. It also estimated that the country's GDP could be up to 10.5 percent lower by the end of 2023 than how the economy appeared to be heading before the 2016 referendum.\n\nBrexit supporters gather near Parliament in London on Tuesday. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images\n\nIn the hours before Tuesday's votes, lawmakers eagerly chatted with the press about why their preferred Brexit model would work best.\n\n\u201cI am 100 percent sure in so far as I can tell that the vast majority of my colleagues want to get an agreement with each other and with the E.U.,\u201d Steve Baker, a Conservative member of Parliament, told NBC News.\n\nBaker is a strong supporter of leaving the E.U. no matter what \u2014 with or without a deal. He put his support behind a plan to replace the Irish backstop with \"alternative arrangements.\"\n\n\"I'm not very optimistic.\"\n\n\n\nTory MP Dominic Grieve says he thinks the EU has a \"settled position\" on the PM's #Brexit deal and isn't confident @Theresa_May will successfully renegotiate.\n\n\n\nLatest on Brexit here: https://t.co/p9x05WAlzo pic.twitter.com/ARcInj5DFJ \u2014 Sky News Politics (@SkyNewsPolitics) January 30, 2019\n\nLawmakers from other parties were just as certain that their way forward would be the one to eventually bring together the divided House of Commons.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of division and discord in the country and the task for us in the Labour Party is to speak to those 'leave' voters and 'remain' voters and unite the country,\u201d said senior Labour Party lawmaker Andy McDonald.\n\nDespite the divisions both inside Parliament and out, there was a festive atmosphere in the streets as hundreds of protesters on both sides of the debate waved signs, flags and balloons.\n\n\u201cWe want out,\u201d shouted supporters of leaving the E.U.\n\nNot far away, a bus campaigning for another referendum drove by, drawing cheers from a group carrying E.U. flags.\n\nAn E.U. supporter demonstrates on a bus near Parliament on Tuesday. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images\n\nWith exit day drawing ever-closer, British businesses have sent regular warnings on the consequences of leaving without a deal.\n\nOn Monday, seven supermarkets, three fast food chains and the British Retail Consortium trade group begged lawmakers to avoid leaving the E.U. without an agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a 'no-deal' Brexit,\u201d they wrote in a letter to lawmakers.\n\nThe absence of an agreement would significantly disrupt goods coming into the U.K., the letter said, pointing out that in March, when Britain is set to leave the E.U., the vast majority of lettuce, tomatoes and soft fruit come from Europe.\n\nAnother deeply frustrating day for business. Renegotiation is a throw-of-the-dice, it must succeed or fail fast. Rejecting no deal is welcome but doesn\u2019t get a deal. Until MPs can agree a solution, the threat of no deal will continue to drain money from the UK. \u2014 Carolyn Fairbairn (@cbicarolyn) January 29, 2019\n\nPrices for basics could skyrocket, with the cost of beef increasing up to 29 percent, cheese up to 32 percent and tomatoes up to 18 percent, the BRC estimated in a report last year.\n\nE.U. negotiators, meanwhile, have signaled frustration with Britain. The 28-country bloc's deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said on Monday that there appeared to be a lack of \"ownership\" in Britain of the agreement struck between the two sides in November.\n\nAccording to experts, the political deadlock is the result of a perfect storm.\n\n\u201cThe divisions are down to the fact that we don\u2019t do referendums very often and the U.K. system was never calibrated to respond to them,\" said Tim Durrant, a senior researcher on Brexit at the nonpartisan Institute for Government think tank. \"In Britain's E.U. referendum, 'leave' could mean all things to all people.\u201d\n\nHe added, \"By holding a referendum and then taking the result as divine truth, it has changed how Parliament deals with finding a consensus.\u201d\n\nWith the clock ticking, lawmakers are under more pressure than ever to come to some sort of compromise.\n\nFor Conservative lawmaker John Baron, the diversity of opinion is all part of the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a parliamentary democracy that\u2019s actually working,\u201d he said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/discovery-hezbollah-attack-tunnels-rattle-northern-israeli-town-n962591", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Hod, 71, nicknamed Hamke, stands his ground alongside his wife, Miriam, on what is officially a restricted military area.\n\nBehind the couple, rows of winter-bare apple trees march down toward Metula, Israel\u2019s northernmost town. The soldier is guarding a long white tent that squats before a huge concrete wall. Above the imposing barrier looms a hill speckled with houses \u2014 the Lebanese town of Kafr Kela.\n\nThe Israeli military found more than apples in Haim Hod's orchard. Hezbollah miltants had dug a tunnel across the border from Lebanon. Dusan Vranic / for NBC News\n\nOnly a few weeks ago Hod\u2019s trees grew on what is now beaten-down earth. On Dec. 4, the couple and the nation were told that an \u201cattack tunnel\u201d had been discovered in Israeli territory that led into Lebanon.\n\nThe first of the six tunnels that were eventually found ran under farmland near Metula, which sits among apple, plum and peach orchards that ring with the chirrups of parakeets and the caw-caw of crows.\n\nOfficials later warned that hundreds of Hezbollah fighters could have streamed through the tunnels, kidnapping and killing civilians and soldiers.\n\nSome in Metula theorize that the town as a whole would have been captured by Hezbollah \u2014 a pro-Palestinian militant group and political party that dominates Lebanese politics and is sponsored by fervently anti-Israel Iran.\n\nHezbollah fighters are coming home from the war winding down in Syria, where they helped prop-up President Bashar al-Assad as he battled rebels trying to unseat him. Fears are running high that as the battle-hardened militants return to an estimated arsenal of 100,000 rockets and missiles, they will intensify their focus on their original foe: Israel.\n\nMetula, at the tip of a stretch of land jutting north into Lebanon, is especially vulnerable to the frequent flare-ups with enemies across the border. The town was shelled during the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel war, which devastated parts of Lebanon.\n\nIn the decade before the 1982 Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon, rockets from Palestinian fighters often sent the people of Metula running to shelters.\n\nBut not Hod \u2014 rockets weren\u2019t going to drive this third-generation farmer from his home.\n\nHis stoicism was beyond exasperating when warning sirens sounded and his wife chased the couple\u2019s four children to safety.\n\nAfter she got the family, minus dad, into a shelter the kids cried over Hod\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cHe is never afraid,\u201d Miriam Hod says over dinner in a hotel the couple run in town. \u201cThat is the problem.\u201d\n\nMiriam Hod, 68, is an artist with short hair, wide eyes and flowers tattooed onto the soft skin of her right hand. Dusan Vranic / for NBC News\n\nHaim Hod smiles, his white teeth standing out against skin darkened by working in the fields since the age of 9.\n\n\u201cIn all the wars, I have never gone to the shelter,\u201d Hod said. \u201cI always sleep in my bed.\u201d\n\nHod may be brave, but he wept last month when he saw what the army had done to his orchard. The military rolled over his precious apple trees, snapping trunks and branches as they sped toward the newly discovered Hezbollah tunnel. The clearing made, 350 trucks flooded the tunnel with cement.\n\n\u201cThe trees are like my children,\u201d he says. \u201cBut security comes before children.\u201d\n\nThe government will reimburse the Hods for losses incurred during the operation.\n\nThe Hods' long tenure in Metula has seen many such trade-offs, the thick stone walls of the 120-year-old family home having been buffeted by waves of war and hardship.\n\nMiriam and Haim Hod stand in front a tent erected by the Israeli military over the exposed tunnel, with the border wall and the Lebanese village of Kafr Kela behind them. Dusan Vranic / for NBC News\n\nHaim Hod's grandparents were the first couple to be married in the town after Baron Edmond de Rothschild, who encouraged the settlement of Jews in what is now Israel, bought the land from a local Arab family.\n\nTimes were often hard and it took the family four decades to repay the French banking scion. Along with other villagers, they periodically had to flee violent flare-ups.\n\nAfter the state of Israel was created in 1948, poverty drove many of Haim Hod\u2019s 10 uncles and aunts away. Some went abroad, but others stayed and helped \u201cbuild Israel,\u201d Miriam says.\n\nNow Israel is warning that it may strike Hezbollah because of the tunnels.\n\n\u201cThis is not merely an act of aggression. This is an act of war,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said soon after the tunnel\u2019s discovery was announced. \u201cThe people of Lebanon have to understand that Hezbollah is putting them in jeopardy and we expect Lebanon to take action.\u201d\n\nSuch statements are part of a wider effort to keep Hezbollah and Iran away from Israel's northern border. Israel has only recently admitted carrying out thousands of attacks on Iranian forces in Syria since 2011, abandoning a policy of secrecy that cloaked its military forays.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Israel attacked targets near Damascus \u2014 killing 21, including at least 12 members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, according to a Syrian war monitoring group.\n\nThe strikes were in response to a rocket that Iranian forces fired toward Israel that was intercepted by Israel's missile defense system over crowded Mount Hermon ski resort.\n\nOn Monday, the head of Iran\u2019s air force announced: \u201cWe\u2019re ready for the decisive war that will bring about Israel\u2019s disappearance from the Earth.\u201d\n\nWhile Israel\u2019s strikes on Syria are not unusual, drawing attention to them so publicly is, said Daniel Byman, a professor at Georgetown and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nHezbollah regularly engages in attempts to encroach on its enemy, Byman said.\n\n\u201cSometimes it is missiles, sometimes it is tunnels, and sometimes it is positions in Syria,\u201d he says.\n\nLate on Saturday, Hezbollah's leader responded for the first time to the tunnels' discovery.\n\nIn an interview with Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV station, Hassan Nasrallah did not answer directly when asked if the group had built the tunnels, although it is widely believed the group was behind most or all of them possibly as part of a plan to invade parts of northern Israel if the conflict escalated dramatically.\n\nHe also told that some of the tunnels were old, and called their late discovery \"a 13-year-old intelligence failure.\"\n\nIn spite of Hezbollah's saber rattling, most experts agree that it does not want a full-scale war with Israel, which is vastly stronger militarily. But there is always the chance that a miscalculation could spiral into one.\n\nLt. Col. Avshalom Dadon does not intend to make any such mistakes. In his capacity as an engineering officer in the 91st Division, he helped oversee the discovery of the six tunnels found running into Israel.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t surprised that we found tunnels,\" said Dadon, 33. \u201cBut we were surprised by their magnitude and infrastructure, and the effort the Hezbollah obviously put into them.\u201d\n\nEach was different, he says \u2014 although they were all big enough for a man to stand upright in and were all wired for electricity.\n\nLt. Col. Avshalom Dadon stands over one of the hundreds of pipes the Israeli military drove into the ground to find tunnels running across the border from Lebanon. Dusan Vranic / for NBC News\n\nJust a few hundred feet behind him, a barrel on a pole painted blue and emblazoned with 'U.N.' marks the boundary with Lebanon.\n\nThis is the Blue Line, the border demarcation between the countries. Clearly visible nearby, a cluster of Lebanese soldiers watch. One takes pictures as members of the elite Yahalom engineering unit, faces covered in black balaclavas, drop a tiny camera through a white tube into the tunnel.\n\n\u201cI understand who our neighbors are, and that we\u2019re surrounded by enemies,\u201d Dadon says at a site where a tunnel was pinpointed near the town of Zar\u2019it. \u201cI totally understand that the people we are facing aren\u2019t stupid. They are learning about the IDF every day,\" he said, referring to the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nDadon punches a fist into his hand several times to describe the process of carving into the hard Dolomite rock. Hezbollah worked for years to dig through the earth here in northern Israel, often living in the tunnels as they built them, he says.\n\nSoldiers drop a camera down through a pipe into what Israeli officials called an attack tunnel running from the Lebanese village of Ramyeh to near the Israeli town of Zar'it. Dusan Vranic / for NBC News\n\nDadon likens the operation to locate the tunnels to looking for a needle in a haystack, and says his forces drilled more than 600 holes in the ground to depths of around 60 feet until the six were pinpointed.\n\nHe breaks into a soft smile as he describes the excitement he felt at discovering the tunnels after years of searching.\n\n\u201cMy wife would kill me to say this, but finding the tunnels \u2014 it\u2019s a little like giving birth,\u201d says the father of two.\n\nIn Metula, a two-minute walk from the Hods\u2019 hotel, students at the town\u2019s primary school discuss regular emergency drills overseen with military precision by headmistress Marsel Leev.\n\nNoga, 11, explains that these help make her feel safe. And as she grows \u201colder and older,\u201d she is feeling \u201cless and less stress\u201d about the threat they all face.\n\nThe girl repeats this breathlessly at least three times, brown eyes widening with emphasis behind dark-rimmed glasses.\n\nLater, Leev walks up a flight of stairs and opens curtains in a classroom to expose a wide panoramic view. The window frames orchards, houses and a road leading out of Metula. Just beyond that snakes the border wall, and then fields, houses and the mountains of Lebanon.\n\nThe building, teachers and students are in themselves a symbol of resilience, she says.\n\n\u201cThe fact that here you have a school that is 150 meters from the border is a statement to the other side,\u201d Leev says. \u201cWe will stay here for generations.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (Jan. 28, 2019, 11:59 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of attacks this month by Israel and Iran, incorrectly suggesting that Iran was responding to an Israeli attack.

Of critical concern to French military planners is implementing a plan to deal with captured ISIS fighters and get them to get of the country before a U.S. withdrawal.\n\nIn an interview with French television BFMTV Tuesday, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t mention specifics\u201d when asked if France was planning to transfer as many as 130 ISIS fighters to French soil.\n\nAlthough France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron lambasted Trump for his decision last month to withdraw from Syria, French officials have been publicly cautious in commenting on how the withdrawal will affect their operations against the former caliphate.\n\nBut behind the scenes, they are dismayed and \u201cdeeply worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican troops have made it clear that they are pulling out and that they received no warning in advance,\u201d the French official said. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve been working around the clock to plan for this American pull-out and how it will affect French military operations in Syria.\u201d\n\nMore than 3,200 French military personnel have operated in Syria as part of Operation Chammal, the French campaign against ISIS. French special operations forces work closely with American, British and other allied units in both Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe French government announced two weeks ago it is committed to keeping troops in Syria and Iraq for the rest of the year, but the senior official admitted France does not think it can maintain a sustained military presence in the country without U.S. support. The official said France was in \u201cclose communication\u201d with Washington about how to proceed.\n\nOne of the key concerns for France and other countries are the hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign nationals who flocked to the Islamic State and fought on its behalf. Hundreds of such foreign nationals have been captured on the battlefield by the U.S. and its allies, including France.\n\nWhat to do with these detainees and returning fighters, or \u201cretournees\u201d as they are known in French, has been a central preoccupation of French counterterror officials.\n\nOf the 22 successful terror attacks in France since 2012, 97 percent were carried out by individuals known to have been radicalized, or otherwise known to police, according to Olivier Guitta, the managing director of GlobalStrat, a risk management firm that studies terrorism. Many of these have been retournees.\n\n\u201cSyrian Democratic Forces are currently holding foreign terrorist fighters, including French nationals, in northeastern Syria,\u201d said Agn\u00e8s Von Der M\u00fchll, a foreign ministry spokesperson. She would not confirm the number of detainees, however, adding that in light of \u201cAmerican decisions,\u201d the French government was \u201cexploring all options in order to prevent these potentially dangerous individuals from escaping or dispersing.\u201d\n\nThe French interior minister said that all of the detainees will be charged upon arrival on French soil. The minister said that each detainee would be charged individually depending on the evidence of crimes they are alleged to have committed \u2014 including murder, kidnapping and torture. Previously, prosecutors have successfully convicted some French ISIS members of \u201cassociation with criminal terrorist activity.\u201d\n\nAlthough the bulk of the captured fighters are believed to be French nationals, many have yet to be positively identified and have only provided \u201cnoms de guerre,\u201d or aliases.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies from around the world have been working to share information about captured fighters and terror suspects, often through Interpol, the global law enforcement organization that is headquartered in France.\n\nInterpol has been central to coordinating global efforts to combat terrorism, and now maintains and disseminates a database of 40,000 profiles of \u201cForeign Terrorist Fighters,\u201d up from just 13 in 2012."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/hundreds-missing-after-brazil-dam-break-burying-region-in-mud-1432527939831", "text": "Hundreds missing after Brazil dam break, burying region in mud 01:10 copied!\n\nDozens are dead after a dam break at an iron ore mine unleashed a wave of mud, covering roads and destroying everything in its path.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syrian-stranded-months-malaysian-airport-gets-fresh-start-canada-n962126", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

That\u2019s a tall order for any government, especially given the tight two-year time frame written into the process.\n\nBut an issue that was hardly mentioned during the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016 has proved trickier to solve than any other: how to handle the border between the Irish Republic, which is in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.\n\nToday, the 310-mile boundary is largely invisible and runs through schools, farmlands, homes and even a church graveyard. It is also the only land border that the U.K. shares with an E.U. country.\n\nAnd because both the U.K. and the Irish Republic are members of the E.U., goods and people currently flow freely between the two countries without checkpoints or passports being inspected. But what happens when Britain departs from the 28-country bloc on March 29 remains a conundrum.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May and the E.U. believe the answer is what is known as the Irish backstop. Here's your guide to the proposed measure, which is hated by many Brexit supporters.\n\nWhy is the border such a sensitive issue?\n\nFor 30 years, starting in the late 1960s, the border was a front line in a conflict known as \"The Troubles\" that killed 3,600 people.\n\nThe dispute pitted republicans, primarily Catholics seeking a united Ireland, against British security forces tasked with maintaining U.K. rule over Northern Ireland.\n\nRepublican murals depicting \"The Troubles\" in the Bogside area of Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Paulo Nunes dos Santos/The New York Times / Redux Pictures\n\nThe republicans also fought against local loyalists, primarily Protestants wanting Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom.\n\nA delicate peace pact was negotiated in 1998, known as the Good Friday Agreement. President Bill Clinton helped broker that accord, which allowed the people of Northern Ireland the right to identify and be accepted as British or Irish, or both, within the E.U.\n\nIt also resulted in the removal of British military checkpoints and watchtowers. These had been regularly targeted by republicans as symbols of British dominance.\n\nA graffiti-covered former border control point in Muff, Ireland, on the border with Northern Ireland. Paulo Nunes dos Santos/The New York Times / Redux Pictures\n\nSome fear Britain\u2019s plan to leave the E.U. could result in such checkpoints being reintroduced, reopening old wounds, upsetting the delicate detente and potentially spurring new violence.\n\nWhat's the current situation?\n\nAs members of the E.U., the U.K. and Ireland are both part of what is known as the single market and customs union.\n\nThe customs union means E.U. member countries make trade agreements as one bloc. They are not allowed to negotiate such deals with other countries on their own, and they trade freely with one another.\n\nThe E.U.\u2019s single market is based around four freedoms of movement: of goods, services, labor and capital.\n\nThe U.K. government has said that once it leaves the E.U., it no longer wants to be part of either the customs union or the single market. Post-Brexit, the country wants the freedom to strike trade deals on its own as well as to limit immigration.\n\nWhat is the Irish backstop?\n\nThe U.K. government and the E.U. have both expressed their commitment to avoiding a so-called hard border, with no physical infrastructure or related checks of any kind, between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nBut if Britain leaves the customs union and/or single market before agreeing to a trade deal with the E.U., then a border or some sort of physical infrastructure like cameras or sensors would likely become necessary to monitor crossings.\n\nTo get over this, the E.U. included a \"backstop\" in the withdrawal agreement it negotiated with May. It is an insurance policy that guarantees the status quo will remain at the Irish border after Brexit by keeping the U.K. inside \u201ca single E.U.-U.K. customs territory\u201d until a trade deal can be struck. It also keeps Northern Ireland aligned to parts of the single market in terms of some rules and regulations.\n\nThe backstop has no end date and would be a permanent feature of their relationship until a trade deal is agreed.\n\nWhy do some British politicians object to it?\n\nMany leading advocates of leaving the E.U. are wary about entering into an agreement that ties the U.K. to the bloc indefinitely.\n\nWith no end date specified, opponents fear that the U.K. could be permanently giving up the opportunity to negotiate its own free trade deals, a major reason many wanted to leave the bloc in the first place.\n\nThe backstop was one of the major reasons why May\u2019s agreement with the E.U. was crushed in Parliament on Jan. 15.\n\nWhat are May's additional challenges?\n\nThe prime minister's ruling Conservatives are a minority government that is propped up by members of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nThe DUP supports Brexit, but will not back any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the U.K.\n\nSince the backstop specifies that Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the E.U. on some single market rules, including on goods, May's proposed agreement is a no-go for the DUP.\n\nMeanwhile, the E.U. insists that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is nonnegotiable.\n\nUnless there are changes made in Parliament, the U.K. will leave the E.U. \u2014 deal or no deal \u2014 on March 29.\n\nIf Britain does crash out without a deal, then it is unclear what would happen on the Irish border."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-trump-administration-s-move-venezuela-came-together-n962576", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Lee and Josh Lederman\n\nThe U.S. government ordered all non-emergency government workers out of Venezuela on Thursday, a day after its long-simmering tensions with the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro erupted into a crisis when President Donald Trump recognized the country's opposition leader as interim president.\n\nEmbassy security in Caracas has been bolstered, and the U.S. has re-positioned assets in the region and begun the voluntary departure of dependents of American diplomats in Venezuela, according to a senior administration official.\n\nThe State Department in recent days has been running contingency plans for potential evacuations from Venezuela and how the U.S. would respond if Maduro were to target protesters or the American embassy, a congressional official said. In the event the U.S. military needed to respond, the U.S. Southern Command could stage out of Colombia, the official said.\n\nOther countries, including Canada, Germany and Haiti, also threw their support to Juan Guaid\u00f3, head of the opposition.\n\nHow did Trump's Venezuela move come to be?\n\nA couple of months ago, U.S. officials began to look at ways to increase pressure on Maduro, according to the senior Trump administration official.\n\nAbout a month ago, the Venezuelan opposition began talking to National Security Council officials and those at the embassy in Caracas, the official said. The idea of invoking a particular article in the Venezuelan Constitution that would trigger the ousting of Maduro grew from those discussions, the official said. The official said the Trump administration then began to explore U.S. recognition of the new president once that article was invoked. Security of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton were for it, according to the official.\n\nMembers of the opposition told U.S. officials they needed international support to shift the political dynamic in Venezuela, the senior administration official said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pompeo, Bolton, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow met to discuss the options, the official said.\n\nThey then met with Trump to discuss recognition, the senior administration official said. After Trump made the decision, Vice President Mike Pence called Guaido Tuesday evening and told him: if on the following day the National Assembly invoked three article that would make him president, Trump would back him.\n\nThe policy rollout was surprisingly well-planned, according to a congressional official. The official said the White House started notifying congressional offices around 9 a.m. Wednesday that Guaid\u00f3 planned to declare himself the acting leader and that the U.S. would be the first country to recognize him.\n\nThe White House had its statement prepared, portions of which were read to congressional officials, emphasizing a part about the importance of Western countries following the U.S. in recognition, the congressional official said.\n\nThis allowed lawmakers inclined to support the administration's move a chance to prepare statements in advance that were then quickly rolled out in the minutes and hours after Trump\u2019s announcement, the congressional official said.\n\nThe senior administration official said the most significant development in the first 24 hours after Trump recognized Guaido was that Venezuela\u2019s military has not made any moves. The official also suggested Maduro may be uncertain about his power over the military because he hadn\u2019t ordered it to squash the protests.\n\nThe official said the U.S. believes the rank-and-file military is most likely with the opposition.\n\nThe U.S. is still figuring out ways to disconnect Maduro from the country's government money, the senior administration official said.\n\nOn oil, one option under consideration is rerouting the money from companies, like PDVSA, to Guaid\u00f3, possibly putting it in a holding place. Administration officials have been talking to businesses in Venezuela, namely Chevron and Cisco. Mnuchin and Ross have been calling financial institutions.\n\nOn Thursday, the State Department served notice to the Federal Reserve that Guaid\u00f3 is the agent for access to Venezuelan assets in U.S. banks.\n\n\u201cWe're focused on making sure that having supported the constitutional effort of the National Assembly that now we\u2019ll provide the backup for them to succeed,\u201d the senior administration official said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/scotland-s-ex-first-minister-alex-salmond-reportedly-arrested-charged-n962096", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Ballistic missiles are the primary delivery mechanism for North Korean nuclear warheads.\n\nThe report from Beyond Parallel, a project sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a defense think tank, was released Monday and comes after an announcement Friday that President Donald Trump \"looks forward\" to meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Un next month \"at a place to be announced at a later date.\"\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the report.\n\n\"The North Koreans are not going to negotiate over things they don\u2019t disclose,\" said Victor Cha, one of the authors of the report. \"It looks like they\u2019re playing a game. They\u2019re still going to have all this operational capability,\" even if they destroy their disclosed nuclear facilities.\n\nCha says the base is \"clearly a mainstay of their strategic missile force,\" but there are no indications it is part of any discussions on denuclearization.\n\nSituated about 130 miles north of the DMZ, Sino-ri Missile Operating Base houses the headquarters for the Korean People\u2019s Army Strategic Rocket Forces missile brigade, a unit responsible for ballistic missiles. The base has been central to developing ballistic missiles that are capable of reaching South Korea, Japan, and even Guam, according to the report.\n\nClick here to read the report\n\nBeyond Parallel researchers estimate North Korea has 20 undisclosed sites where it continues to develop its ballistic missile program. Sino-ri is one of the oldest of those sites but is still operational today. Satellite photos dated Dec. 27, 2018, show an entrance to an underground bunker, hardened shelters, and a headquarters area, according to Beyond Parallel. The underground bunkers have rock and dirt berms in front that appear to protect them from artillery fire and airstrikes. The base is just under 7 square miles in size.\n\nSino-ri is supported by two nearby facilities, the Sobaek-su Academy and Myodu-san training area.\n\nThe Sobaek-su Academy was established in the late 1950s or 1960s as an artillery officer\u2019s school and expanded in the following decades, becoming a ballistic missile school early this century, according to the report.\n\nThe school not only educates Strategic Rocket Forces officers, but it may also conduct research on \"ballistic missile design and operation,\" the report says. Satellite photos show buildings suspected to hold barracks and classrooms, vehicle storage facilities, and an entrance to an underground facility.\n\nThe Myodu-san training area sits less than a mile from the academy and may serve as the training facility for the both the Sino-ri missile base and the academy.\n\nOverview of the Sino-ri Missile Operating Base, Sobaek-su Academy, and Myodu-san training area on Dec. 28, 2018.

Kim Jong Un has more leverage in the meeting if he\u2019s just met with Chinese,\" Cha said, adding, \"The Chinese want to make sure that they see Kim before he has another meeting with the U.S. too.\"\n\nThe Trump administration tapped Cha as ambassador to South Korea, but his nomination was withdrawn in early 2018 because of policy disagreements.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump tweeted about a possible second summit, saying he is \"looking forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at the end of February!\" Trump also wrote, \"The Media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea.\"\n\nThe Media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea.

Those concerns have escalated since Trump's Syria announcement on troop withdrawal after speaking with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Japanese officials in particular are \"extremely nervous.\"\n\n\"They\u2019re incredibly uncomfortable,\" the former official said.\n\nThey anticipate Trump could agree to international sanctions relief, a liaison office in Pyongyang and an end-of-war declaration, the official said, adding that North Korean officials have told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo they want sanctions relief but the end-of-war declaration is not as much of a priority.\n\nMany good conversations with North Korea-it is going well!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2018\n\nSome Trump administration officials and U.S. allies are nervous because there is still so little known about what Kim and Trump talked about when they met in Singapore last year. Only the interpreter knows, the official said.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think the president is telling anyone what he told him,\" the former official said, so the North Koreans can use that to tell American negotiators whatever they want about what Trump said.\n\nTrump said in July via Twitter that the recent lack of North Korean missile launches is a sign that his approach is working.\n\nThe Syria announcement has solidified for world leaders, including those in Japan and South Korea, that the only thing that matters in terms of achieving the U.S. position they want is getting a one-on-one with Trump. \"They all know that you\u2019ve got to get to the president and that the president, because he doesn\u2019t study that much, is probably an easy mark,\" the former official said. \"This is a leader game.

The recent failure to complete the Special Measures Agreement, a regularly renewed five-year defense pact between the U.S. and South Korea, increases the chances of a fight in the alliance, and that precipitates withdrawal, the former official said.\n\n\"I can\u2019t find anybody in the U.S. who thinks the North Koreans are denuclearizing,\" the former official said. \"There was a reluctant conclusion that they had to roll the dice on another summit\" to get negotiations moving again.\n\nJung Pak, a former U.S. intelligence officer who has long tracked North Korea and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said experts both inside and outside the government don\u2019t believe Kim is ready to give up his nuclear arsenal.\n\nPaul Cheung / NBC News\n\n\"Credible Korea experts and watchers assess that Kim is highly unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons,\" Pak told NBC News.\n\nThe U.S. government assesses that North Korean ballistic missile development and activity has continued throughout 2018 and into 2019, but North Korea\u2019s actions have not been as aggressive as in 2017 when it launched about two-dozen missiles during 16 tests. North Korea\u2019s missile program made dramatic strides in 2017 with numerous ICBM launches and while the launches ceased in 2018, the development did not.\n\nDespite the U.S. desire for the North Koreans to provide a full accounting of their ballistic missile sites and nuclear weapons program, North Korea has not yet done so.\n\nThe Trump administration says the discussions with the North have already produced progress by lowering tensions, and that the regime has not conducted new missile or nuclear tests since the diplomacy began.\n\nBut former officials and lawmakers say North Korea remains an unpredictable danger to the U.S. and its allies, with an increasingly capable nuclear and missile arsenal.\n\n\"Tensions have been reduced. But the North Korean threat has not been reduced,\" Pak said. \"Those are two different things.\"\n\nU.S. officials also acknowledge that North Korea continues to produce fissile material for weapons."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/theresa-may-s-brexit-plan-b-expected-be-tweaked-version-n960881", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Her solution? To press ahead with largely the same plan \u2014 albeit with a few tweaks around the edges.\n\nThere are 67 days left until the U.K. is due to leave the European Union on March 29, and no agreement among lawmakers on how or even whether the country should leave.\n\nThe one certainty at the moment is that if lawmakers fail to agree to a plan, Britain will crash out of the bloc with no agreement on its trading relationship. In the event of a chaotic \"no-deal\" Brexit, the Bank of England has warned the economy could shrink by as much as 8 percent in about a year. It also estimated that the country's GDP could be up to 10.5 percent lower by the end of 2023 than how the economy appeared to be heading before the 2016 referendum.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, May struck a more inclusive tone when she returned to Parliament to set out her way forward on Brexit. She said that any deal would protect worker's rights and the environment \u2014 a key concern of the opposition Labour Party. She also said that the government would waive a fee for the new settled status that E.U. citizens in Britain would need after Brexit.\n\nOn the stickiest point of the agreement \u2014 a guarantee to keep open the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland, a separate country that is part of the E.U. \u2014 she said she would hold further consultations to \"find the broadest possible consensus\".\n\nMay said that a new motion would be debated and voted on next week.\n\nIt\u2019s like last week\u2019s vote never happened. Plan B is Plan A \u2014 Sarah Wollaston MP (@sarahwollaston) January 21, 2019\n\nDespite the unprecedented opposition to her plan \u2014 her deal was crushed 432 to 202 on Tuesday \u2014 some analysts believe May could eventually manage to get it through Parliament.\n\n\u201cThe closer we get to the 29th of March, [lawmakers] might swing behind her. It is head-spinningly messy,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London.\n\nAfter the deal was thrown out last week, May said she would consult with lawmakers from all parties to find a new way forward. That hasn't exactly worked out as planned, and she is also seeking to win over pro-Brexit hardliners within her party \u2014 who thought her proposal didn't provide enough of a break from the E.U. \u2014 as well as members of the Democratic Unionist Party, a small group of Northern Irish politician which props up the government.\n\nMore than one-third of lawmakers from May's Conservative Party voted against her divorce proposal last week.\n\nMeanwhile, other lawmakers are exploring ways to use parliamentary rules to wrestle control of the Brexit process away from May.\n\n\u201cNo one here pays attention to procedure until you end up with this crunch and suddenly it matters a lot,\u201d said David Howarth, a professor of law and public policy at the University of Cambridge, and a former member of Parliament.\n\nEven if May wins support in Parliament for her plan B, the E.U. has consistently refused to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe E.U.\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier reiterated in an interview with Irish news station RTE on Monday that the agreement is the \u201cbest deal possible.\u201d\n\nThe E.U. is now \u201cwaiting for the next step\u201d from the U.K. However, he confirmed that the E.U. would be willing to make changes to the political declaration that accompanied the agreement, though these changes would likely not be legally binding.\n\nMay has staunchly stuck to the line that it is her responsibility to see the U.K. out of the E.U. However, support for staying in the E.U. surged to its highest level since the last referendum, and now has a 12 point lead over leaving the bloc, according to a YouGov poll conducted last Wednesday.\n\nIn the June 2016 referendum, 52 percent of voters backed leaving the E.U. while 48 percent backed staying.\n\nIf the U.K. fails to decide on a course of action, it will face a \"no-deal\" scenario that most experts say would be a nightmare scenario.\n\nShortages of food and medicine, civil unrest, chaos at ports and airports have all been forecast as possibilities under a \"no-deal\" Brexit.\n\nThere are also concerns for what Brexit means for the border between Northern Ireland. The border is currently more or less invisible and there are no checkpoints. Some fear the reinstatement of a physical boundary risks a return to \"The Troubles,\" rekindling tensions that might spill over into violence.

Mazlum Kobane, who is in charge of the coalition of militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nU.S. troops and Kurdish-led fighters were \"brothers in arms\" as partners on the ground in the war against ISIS in Syria, he added.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s announcement that he was withdrawing all U.S. troops from the country immediately has left the Kurds feeling abandoned. The president tweeted on Dec. 19 that the U.S. had \u201cdefeated ISIS in Syria,\u201d adding that was the \u201conly reason\u201d to have troops on the ground there.\n\nOn Wednesday, ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide attack in Manbij that killed 19, including four Americans.\n\nKobane highlighted that Trump's decision, which was widely seen as the abandonment of a loyal ally, was made against the advice of some U.S. commanders.\n\n\u201cThey are embarrassed,\u201d Kobane said, referring to his American counterparts. \u201cThey didn\u2019t expect this decision. It\u2019s out of their hands, and they are constantly apologizing for it.\u201d\n\nThe general added that 6,500 of his fighters had been killed while taking on ISIS.\n\nTurkey has designated the Syrian Kurds' YPG militia as a terrorist organization and consider it part of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party.\n\nThe Kurds now fear an attack by NATO member Turkey, which views Kurdish separatism as a paramount security threat.\n\nAdministration officials have this month suggested the Syria drawdown will happen more slowly than Trump initially suggested. On Jan. 6, national security adviser John Bolton said that American troops would not depart northeastern Syria until Turkey pledges not to target the Kurdish fighters.\n\nStarting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019\n\n....Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia, Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria - natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019\n\nBut Kobane said the Kurds still see the pending U.S. pullout as \u201can insult, a breach of credibility and a broken promise.\u201d\n\nRichard Engel reported from Kobane, Syria, and Kennett Werner from London."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/maria-butina-wanted-influence-society-sister-says-n959661", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Courtesy of Butina family\n\nButina was an ambitious student who got mostly A's and enjoyed studying English, her family said.\n\nLike many other students in Russia, Butina learned how to assemble and disassemble Kalashnikovs as part of a first aid-related class at school. She was always among the fastest at the exercise, according to her younger sister, Marina.\n\nIn addition to shooting, Butina also played volleyball and skied, and enjoyed reading Harry Potter novels and books by Ray Bradbury.\n\nShe later attended the local Altai State University where she received degrees in political science and education, her parents said.\n\nIn 2011, she founded a Russian pro-gun rights group called the Right to Bear Arms.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to influence society,\u201d her sister told NBC News.\n\n\u201cAt one point she grew so much that there wasn\u2019t enough space for her in this town anymore,\" Butina's father added. \"And when she had the opportunity to go to the capital, she took it.\"\n\nMaria Butina featured in the Right to Bear Arms magazine, September 2014. Courtesy of Butina family\n\nHowever, one firearms instructor reportedly said that Butina had no idea how to use a weapon around the time she set up Right to Bear Arms.\n\nSpeaking to the Associated Press in July, Boris Pashchenko recounted a 2011 encounter with Butina.\n\n\"I said [to Maria Butina], 'what about shooting?'\" he recalled. \"Maria said, 'I have never tried it.' I said, 'Come to us. Our acquaintance started with this. She came here, I gave [her] a gun, a rifle, and she tried to shoot.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Pashchenko and Butina\u2019s relatives gave different accounts of her level of familiarity with guns.\n\nAfter moving to Moscow, Butina began traveling to America for NRA conventions.\n\nMaria Butina at a Virginia shooting range in August 2016. Courtesy of Butina family\n\nIn December 2015, Butina helped orchestrate a trip by NRA members to Moscow in which she set up a meeting between the American gun supporters and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, court papers say.\n\nIn 2016, she moved to the U.S. to pursue a master's degree at American University in Washington on a student visa.\n\nThe charge against Butina was brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, unrelated to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn pleading guilty, Butina admitted to working with her Republican operative boyfriend Paul Erickson \u2014 identified in court papers as as \"U.S. Person 1\" \u2014 at the behest of a Russian official in order \"to establish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over U.S. politics \u2026 for the benefit of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nErickson has not been charged.\n\nThe Russian fits the description of Alexander Torshin, who recently retired as deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia. As NBC News has previously reported, Torshin reached out to the Trump campaign seeking a meeting between Putin and Trump. He met Donald Trump Jr. in May 2016 at an NRA dinner.\n\nThe Russian government has strenuously denied that Butina has any ties to official government conduct.\n\nButina was arrested in July 2018, just hours after President Donald Trump and met Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin privately at a summit in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nThe felony Butina pleaded guilty to carries a potential prison term of up to five years. As she's not a U.S. citizen, Butina faces deportation after serving her sentence.\n\nMaria Butina, right, and her sister, Marina, in 1995. Courtesy of Butina family\n\nButina\u2019s father said family members speak with her about once a week from prison, where she awaits sentencing.\n\nMost of his daughter's belongings are already back in Russia, with the most recent batch arriving about a month and half ago, he added.\n\nBut Butina's father can't explain how she ended up behind bars in the U.S, saying that he \"can only guess\" that she didn't know \"all the legal nuances.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/el-chapo-s-mistress-details-his-daring-escape-in-courtroom-testimony-1428978243699", "text": "El Chapo\u2019s mistress details his daring escape in courtroom testimony 01:41 copied!\n\nLucero Guadalupe S\u00e1nchez, a former Mexican lawmaker, was El Chapo\u2019s mistress for three years.

Hawar News Agency / AFP - Getty Images\n\nCoalition forces were on foot in the city when they were approached at around 1 p.m. local time (6 a.m. ET) by a man wearing civilian clothing with explosives hidden underneath, the Kurdish official added.\n\nThe blast happened in a market area of small alleys that is crowded with shops and street vendors.\n\nTwo Manbij residents said the explosion took place in front of Kusr al-Umra, a downtown restaurant where U.S. troops routinely eat. Two other witnesses told NBC News that several American troops were inside the eatery at the time of blast, while others waited outside.\n\nU.S. defense officials said the attack occurred while troops were on patrol. They had stopped at a restaurant when a suicide attacker blew himself up.\n\nSaif al-Din Tayyar, a journalist who said he was nearby when the explosion occurred, said he saw around 25 people either dead or wounded. NBC News could not immediately verify his report.\n\nWitnesses told NBC News that military helicopters were sent to the scene to help deal with the casualties.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for the attack through recognized social media accounts, claiming a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest attacked coalition forces. ISIS did not immediately produce evidence to support the claim.\n\nAmerican defense officials said that despite the claim of responsibility by the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS, there has been little to no ISIS presence in Manbij in months, and the terror group sometimes falsely claims responsibility for attacks.\n\nWednesday\u2019s killing of two U.S. service members was the single deadliest day for American forces in Syria.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, four service members died in the country, including two in combat, according to the Defense Department. Each of the four deaths occurred on different days.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that President Donald Trump had been \"fully briefed and we will continue to monitor the ongoing situation in Syria.\"\n\n\"Our deepest sympathies and love go out to the families of the brave American heroes who were killed today in Syria,\" a statement from the White House press secretary said. \"We also pray for the soldiers who were wounded in the attack. Our service members and their families have all sacrificed so much for our country.\"\n\nJust hours after the attack, Vice President Mike Pence touted the administration\u2019s success defeating ISIS. \"The caliphate has crumbled and ISIS has been defeated,\" Pence told diplomats at the Global Chiefs of Mission Conference in Washington D.C.\n\nHe added immediately afterwards that the U.S. would \"stay in the region and we\u2019ll stay in the fight to ensure that ISIS does not rear its ugly head again,\u201d but did not specify where or what that would entail.\n\nThe attack comes weeks after Trump announced that he was withdrawing all U.S. troops from Syria immediately.\n\nOn Dec. 19, he tweeted that the U.S. had \u201cdefeated ISIS in Syria,\u201d adding that was the \u201conly reason\u201d to have troops on the ground there.\n\n\"We have won against ISIS. We have beaten them and we have beaten them badly,\" he said in a video posted on his Twitter account.\n\nAdministration officials later said the drawdown will happen more slowly.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton said on Jan. 6 that American troops will not leave northeastern Syria until ISIS is defeated and American-allied Kurdish fighters are protected.\n\nTurkey has threatened to attack the Kurds, who have been America's partners on the ground in the war against ISIS in Syria.

He said he never fought for ISIS and said he was detained nearly a dozen times for refusing to take up arms.\n\nEach time, Clark said, ISIS let him go and he suffered no abuse at their hands. But he admitted offering to work for them as an English teacher.\n\nNBC News reported last year that Clark's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was found at a house in Iraq and was later obtained by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. In a cover letter, Clark said he was hoping to obtain a job teaching English to students in territory seized by ISIS.\n\n\"I was born and raised in the United States and have always loved teaching others and learning from others as well. My work background is largely in English and I consider working at the University of Mosul to be a great way of continuing my career,\" read the cover letter, which used the alias Abu Muhammad al-Ameriki.\n\nThe r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included an email address, education credentials and work experience, and the researchers were able to determine that Abu Muhammad al-Ameriki was Clark, who graduated from the University of Houston.\n\n\"I was in living in Mosul at the time, and I needed a way to support myself,\" Clark said.\n\nClark says he was drawn to ISIS out of curiosity.\n\n\"I wanted to learn more about the ideology. I'm a political science major, global business minor. I like politics. I like travel, world events. That's what I wanted to do,\" he said.\n\nBut while Clark claims he was able to avoid fighting on the front lines, the war was never far away.\n\n\"It was a place that was constantly being bombed,\" he said. \"You were always on edge. Day and night, just bombs and airstrikes. You sleep in the middle of the day. I spent most of my time living in a mosque. I just remember every day hoping not to get bombed.\"\n\nClark said he crossed into Syria from Turkey in June 2015.\n\nThe Texan was detained around the same time as two foreign militants from Pakistan, a fourth from Dublin, Ireland, and fifth man from Trinidad and Tobago, according to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nThe State Department said it was aware of \"these open source reports\" but gave no further comment.\n\nShiraz Maher, deputy director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King's College London, said there were conflicting reports on how many foreign fighters remained in Syria.\n\n\"Some have been captured, some have been killed and some are still alive and operational,\" he said.\n\nLast year, a report by the Program on Extremism found that 64 Americans had traveled to Iraq and Syria in support of the Islamic State since 2011.

Global markets lost $2 trillion in value. The U.S. dollar increased in value, and \"that's not always a good thing,\" White-King said. A higher dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive for buyers in other countries. It also means stocks and U.S. investments are more expensive for international buyers.\n\n\"As we get closer to [Brexit date] March 29, the amount of uncertainty is going to increase,\" said Peter Earle, economist and research fellow at The American Institute for Economic Research. \"That's going to affect the markets.\"\n\nNot only could stocks take a hit, but so might bond yields \"as investors and different entities in other markets jump into government bonds for safety,\" he added. And that would mean investment and retirement accounts for regular Americans.\n\nThere's a more direct impact on U.S. businesses: \"Many American businesses use the U.K. as their doorway to the E.U.,\" Earle told NBC News. \"With a hard Brexit, that's going to cause a lot of complications for U.S. businesses.\" Companies will find it harder and more expensive to move goods between the U.K. and rest of Europe, with delays, tariffs, and more paperwork.\n\nEven travel for salespeople, technical personnel, and executives will be more difficult. What used to be a quick trip from the U.K. to the continent or back now would require more time clearing customs and less assurance of easy movement.\n\nWhile none of this is directly apparent to U.S. consumers, \"It eventually works its way into the consumer level,\" said Johan Gott, a principal at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.\n\nThe biggest problem for businesses may be that they aren't preparing sufficiently. According to Gott, \"by and large, the U.S. focus in the business community has been very much on China, on steel tariffs, and to a certain degree the possibility of U.S. auto tariffs, which could be very disruptive.\"\n\n\"Businesses can deal with almost anything if they have warning and things are gradual,\" Gott said. \"Right now, we're seeing a two-month window and no idea of what will happen.\" And no idea how bad things might get with the lack of preparation."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/rescuers-attempt-reach-2-year-old-boy-who-fell-down-n958351", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Nearly 64 percent of people in Thanet, the administrative district that includes the once-thriving port town of Ramsgate, supported leaving in the 2016 referendum.\n\nSince then, both the government and experts have predicted that Brexit will result in the U.K. being worse off.\n\nThe Bank of England has warned that a \"disorderly\" scenario \u2014 involving severe delays at U.K. borders and financial markets' loss of confidence in British institutions \u2014 could shrink the British economy as much as 8 percent in about a year, with the value of the pound tumbling 25 percent, and house prices falling by 30 percent.\n\nFood and medicine shortages are also possibilities if U.K. ports end up gridlocked due to customs checks being introduced, and the government has said 3,500 troops will be on standby to help deal with disruptions or civil unrest.\n\nBritain will leave the 28-country bloc on March 29 \u2014 but with only 74 days to go, lawmakers are bitterly divided about the proposed divorce agreement, meaning a \"no-deal\" Brexit without any arrangement for future trade is the default option.\n\nThe country's finance minister last year also warned that a split without a pact would cost Britain tens of billions of dollars \u2014 more than it currently contributes to the E.U.\n\nHowever, the \"no-deal\" option would \u201cplease\u201d or \u201cdelight\u201d around 15 percent of people, according to recent YouGov polls.\n\nMany who support Brexit are anxious for the government to get on with it, no matter the cost.\n\n\u201cThere is little doubt that this multicultural experiment has failed miserably,\u201d said Piper, a local politician and former Baptist minister.\n\nStuart Piper Rachel Elbaum / NBC News\n\nProponents of the U.K.\u2019s departure feel that the E.U. has held Britain back from economic success and that its freedom of movement laws have allowed too many low-skilled migrants into the country.\n\nAround 700 migrants moved to Thanet in 2017, according to local government figures. The district is home to around 140,000 people.\n\nPiper, like many others who support Brexit, isn\u2019t against Europe as a trade partner. His son recently migrated to Poland, and Piper lived for many years in Germany while serving in the army.\n\nHe called the predictions of a poorer future outside the E.U. \u201claughable,\u201d claiming such warnings are nothing more than \"project fear\" \u2014 or scaremongering by elites.\n\n\u201cLeaving the E.U. won\u2019t make life here better, but it won\u2019t make it worse,\u201d said Neil Hopkins, as he fixed a tablet computer at his shop, the IT Service Centre, in Ramsgate.\n\nWith cuts to public services and a lack of hospital spaces, he felt Britain \u201ccouldn\u2019t carry on importing E.U. nationals. No deal is fine.\u201d\n\nSince late last year, hundreds of migrants have also left France and made the 21-mile journey across the English Channel \u2014 one of the world's busiest shipping lanes \u2014 in flimsy dinghies and other small vessels.

At the end of December, the government awarded a $18 million contract to a shipping company to operate ferries from Ramsgate to Ostend, a city on the Belgian coast, in the event of a backlog at the nearby port of Dover.\n\nHowever, it was later found that the company does not own any ships.\n\nA sign opposite the abandoned passenger terminal at the Port of Ramsgate.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 13, 2019, 2:07 PM GMT By Stefania D'Ignoti\n\nLAMPEDUSA, Italy \u2014 Francesco Tuccio, a carpenter on this island of less than 8 square miles halfway between Sicily and Tunisia, remembers the day in April of 2009 when his life took on a new purpose.\n\nShipwrecks and migrant landings on the coast had already become a daily routine on Lampedusa, which is located in the Mediterranean Sea. That morning, Tuccio decided to close his shop and joined a few dozen volunteers working to recover the bodies of drowned migrants who had washed ashore.\n\n\u201cI remember two boats attempted to enter the port that day: One made it, the other sank. More than 100 people, mostly from Somalia and Eritrea, lost their lives,\u201d Tuccio said, his voice breaking with emotion. \u201cWhat struck me the most was returning home and hearing no news reports even just mentioning the tragedy.\u201d\n\nOver the past several years, Lampedusa, with a population of 6,500, has earned the nickname of \u201cdoor to Europe\u201d as it has become both a major human smugglers\u2019 hub and Italy\u2019s first port for migrants rescued at sea. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 2,000 people died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea in 2018.\n\nFrancesco Tuccio uses wood salvaged from migrant boats to make crosses in his workshop. Courtesy Francesco Tuccio\n\nTuccio\u2019s experience that day prompted him to think of ways he could help bring attention to the human tragedy affecting his native island. While taking a walk on a local beach that afternoon, he noted two colorful pieces of wood, positioned in a strange way, recalling the shape of a cross. He quickly realized those were lose pieces of a forgotten migrant dinghy.\n\nTuccio ended up using wood recovered from wrecked boats like that one to create a series of crucifixes \u2014 symbols of the ongoing and increasingly overlooked migrant crisis affecting Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The crosses are now displayed in parishes and homes across the globe, with one even on exhibit at the British Museum in London.\n\n\u201cThe idea came as a flash. I decided to put my carpentry skills to good use and build a cross that would be a daily reminder of the shipwrecks. The local priest liked the idea so much that he proposed to use my first prototype for the Easter procession that took place that same month,\u201d Tuccio said.\n\n\u201cAs a practicing Catholic, I associate the cross with resurrection, a metaphor about migrants landing safely and beginning a new life in Europe. The wood I use represents death and tragedy but also hope, rebirth and Christian salvation,\u201d he added.\n\nNow, nearly 10 years later, Tuccio still goes out every morning to collect driftwood, which he then carves, smooths, and transforms into crosses in his workshop. The layers of damaged paint remain on the wood as a reminder of the materials\u2019 tragic source.\n\nInternational impact\n\nToday, one of Tuccio\u2019s crucifixes can be found on the altar inside the chapel of the Anglican Centre in Rome.\n\nRev. Justin Lewis-Anthony, deputy director of the center, displays the artwork because he believes it \u201chelps us to be faithful to the Lord, who gave his life on the cross for all, for those [safe in Europe], and for those in the little boats,\u201d he told NBC News.\n\nFrancesco Tuccio's work-in-progress crosses in his workshop in Lampedusa. Courtesy Francesco Tuccio\n\nIn 2015, the British Museum acquired one of Tuccio\u2019s crosses to exhibit as a symbol of the refugee crisis and Lampedusa\u2019s role in helping migrants.\n\n\u201cTen years ago we didn\u2019t have the same help we have now. It was just us, a tiny island, faced with bigger human challenges than we could bear,\u201d Tuccio said. \u201cThen reporting on migrants became a trend, and we were finally able to tell our story, too.\u201d\n\nPope Francis visited Lampedusa in July 2013 to show support for the victims of the Mediterranean route and the island\u2019s residents \u2014 just three months before 368 people drowned in one of the deadliest accidents of the refugee crisis. The pope celebrated a public mass, during which Tuccio presented him with one of his handmade crosses.\n\nMoved by the symbolism of Tuccio\u2019s crosses, priests and archbishops from North America to Africa and as far as New Zealand began ordering them for their chapels as a reminder of collective human suffering.\n\nOutreach within Italy\n\nTuccio\u2019s idea has inspired other Sicilian carpenters, as well.\n\nIn Santa Venerina, a village on the Etna volcano in Sicily, Marco Lovato founded the nonprofit social cooperative Ro\u2019 La Formichina in 2001 to teach handicraft skills to migrants, disadvantaged local youth, people with disabilities, former drug addicts, and former inmates.\n\n\u201cWhen we began assisting some migrant unaccompanied minors, we had the chance to listen to their stories firsthand, instead of thinking about them as strangers we would only briefly see on a TV screen,\u201d Lovato said. \u201cWe gave them a recognizable face, they became part of our daily lives.\u201d\n\nAbout four years ago, he turned his attention to the drownings at sea resulting from the migrant crisis.\n\nA crucifix produced by the young carpenters of Ro' La Formichina. Ro' La Formichina\n\nLa Formichina carpentry teacher Alberto Pennisi, 45, recalls an excursion to beaches in eastern Sicily with two carpentry apprentices who were migrant minors from Egypt and Nigeria.\n\nHe recalled that they froze, immersed in their own thoughts for a few moments, when they saw wrecks on the beach.\n\n\u201cWe saw boats like beached whales and they probably started remembering what they went through when they crossed the sea to reach Europe,\u201d Pennisi said. \u201cWe had the idea of producing crosses together as a metaphor for the need to put a shoulder under those who have a bigger cross to carry.\u201d\n\nLaunching the project was not without challenges, however.\n\n\u201cWe either ask port authorities to recover the wood and donate it to us, since usually it gets destroyed or left to rot on the beach, or we go to boat cemeteries and pick it up ourselves. But the bureaucratic procedure to actually own it is very strict,\u201d Pennisi said.\n\nCurrently, La Formichina employs six disadvantaged boys who work to produce hundreds of crosses under Pennisi\u2019s supervision. The boys earn a monthly salary from the work, which also helps them integrate into the community.\n\nSince the majority of the boys \u201care Muslims, of course the crucifixes have a totally different meaning for them, but nonetheless they ... create a bond through wood with us Catholic believers,\" Pennisi said.\n\nThe group sold about 70 crosses worldwide during the past holiday season, Lovato said. \"On average we produce between 300 and 400 per year. Some clients ask for custom ones in terms of size,\" he added.\n\n\u201cThese crosses represent a reminder to not forget [the world\u2019s] injustices,\u201d Lovato said.\n\nWhile new IOM data shows that migrant landings in Italy have consistently decreased in the past year, the situation on the ground remains volatile \u2014 especially as Italy\u2019s interior minister Matteo Salvini continues to mandate that all ports remain closed to migrants.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuccio continues to construct crosses with the intent of bringing attention to the ongoing humanitarian crisis.\n\n\u201cThe right to live a dignified life should not be a luxury for few people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a right for all.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/how-brexit-could-push-ireland-to-the-brink-1423834179626", "text": "How Brexit could push Northern Ireland to the brink 06:14 copied!\n\nThe British Parliament has yet to agree on how exactly they should leave the European Union.

The CIA has assessed that bin Salman ordered his murder.\n\nExperts and former officials say Pompeo\u2019s failure to address human rights abuses broke with a decades-long American diplomatic tradition and represented a missed opportunity to deliver a tough message that Washington would not turn a blind eye to the trampling of civil liberties in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThey've made it clear they're going to stand behind MBS,\u201d said Andrea Prasow of Human Rights Watch, referring to the crown prince.\n\nWhile Pompeo and other U.S. officials might privately convey to Riyadh their concerns over Khashoggi\u2019s murder, Prasow said it\u2019s hard to see how that would have an effect \u201cbecause Mohammed bin Salman has a very strong basis to assume that the U.S. will not alter its behavior regardless of what he does.\u201d\n\nBefore arriving in Riyadh, the secretary of state said Sunday the U.S. would ensure there is \"full and complete\" accountability for Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\n\"We will continue to talk about that and make sure we have all the facts so that they are held accountable certainly by the Saudis but by the U.S. as well where appropriate,\" Pompeo said in Doha.\n\nBin Salman has denied any role in the death and Saudi authorities have put 11 suspects on trial for the killing.\n\nBut the U.S. government believes the crown prince remains in communication with Saud al-Qahtani, an adviser to bin Salman who the CIA suspects organized the assassination of Khashoggi. The Washington Post first reported the two were in contact. Qahtani was fired from his post in the wake of the Khashoggi killing.\n\nLong before Khashoggi was killed by government agents inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, the kingdom launched a sweeping crackdown on all forms of political criticism, targeting activists, women\u2019s rights advocates, academics and prominent clerics, according to human rights groups and former U.S. officials.\n\nEven in a country with a dismal human rights record, the government\u2019s clampdown in recent years has marked a dramatic plunge into repression, with dozens \u2014 possibly hundreds \u2014 imprisoned and tortured for actions that might have earned them a brief detention in the past, according to human rights groups and former U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has always been a gross violator of human rights, but the level of repression under Mohammed bin Salman and the reach of the kingdom\u2019s security services and their willingness to follow citizens around the world seems to have increased significantly,\u201c said Philippe Nassif of Amnesty International.\n\nThe campaign has coincided with the rise of bin Salman in the kingdom\u2019s leadership, culminating with his elderly father, King Salman, naming him crown prince in June 2017. The crown prince, or MBS, has portrayed himself as a visionary reformer but he has shown an intolerance for criticism or independent-minded public figures. His adviser, Qahtani, who oversaw a cyber security office, also played a pivotal role in the repression, rights groups and U.S. officials say.\n\nThe long list of political prisoners currently behind bars includes a group of women\u2019s rights activists who pushed for an end to the ban on women driving. The activists were rounded up shortly before the ban was lifted last June.\n\nFour of them have been subjected to torture, sexual harassment and sexual assault, according to Human Rights Watch and other rights advocates, which cited informed sources that asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office of the White House on March 20, 2018. Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nSaudi authorities allegedly administered electric shocks, whipped the women on their thighs, and forced them to hug and kiss, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nFollowing the interrogations, the women allegedly showed physical signs of torture, including difficulty walking, uncontrolled shaking of the hands, and red marks and scratches on their faces and necks.\n\nSaudi Arabia has denied the allegations. But Saudi officials also initially denied Khashoggi had been killed in the consulate in Istanbul.\n\nAn independent Saudi group that monitors human rights in Saudi Arabia, ALQST, reported that two of the detained female activists saw the crown prince\u2019s longtime adviser, Qahtani, in the building where the torture was being carried out.\n\nThe imprisoned female activists include Samar Badawi, who campaigned for women\u2019s voting rights and an end to male guardianship laws that require women to obtain permission from a male family member before traveling abroad, obtaining a passport or getting married. In 2012, the State Department gave her the U.S. International Women of Courage Award, which was presented by then-first lady Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nEven the mother of the Saudi crown prince has had her movements restricted at times, current and former U.S. officials told NBC News earlier this year. The officials said intelligence showed MBS has often blocked her from seeing the king and even put his mother under house arrest for a period, as he feared she could undermine his grab for power.\n\nSaudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi talks on his cell phone at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 29, 2011. Virginia Mayo / AP file\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s official discrimination against women surpasses that of other conservative Islamic countries in the Gulf, rights advocates say, and recent cases of young Saudi women seeking asylum abroad have highlighted their plight.\n\nEighteen-year-old Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun barricaded herself in her hotel room in Bangkok this month to avoid being deported.

High Commissioner of Refugees took up her case and eventually Canada granted her asylum, with Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland greeting her after she landed in Toronto on Saturday, introducing her as \u201ca very brave new Canadian.\u201d\n\nAlthough Saudi Arabia has never allowed anything approaching freedom of expression, under the crown prince\u2019s influence, the space for permissible public debate has come under unprecedented pressure. Saudi authorities are now requesting the death penalty for relatively routine cases of political dissent and public figures have faced punishment in some cases not for critical remarks, but merely for failing to rally behind the regime, experts said.\n\nRahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, center, stands with Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, right, as she arrives at Toronto Pearson International Airport, on Jan.12, 2019.

Instead, he called for reconciliation with Qatar.\n\n\u201cDissent today is not about voicing your opposition to policies or opposition to the regime. If you\u2019re a public figure it becomes about you not actively supporting the regime,\u201d said Yasmine Farouk, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nA Saudi group that tries to track political prisoners, Prisoners of Conscience, estimated last September that there are more than 2,600 Saudi dissidents in detention.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nApart from imposing sanctions on 17 individuals over the Khashoggi murder, President Donald Trump has signaled no plans to review the U.S. alliance with Riyadh, suspend any arms sales or pursue any more punitive measures. Instead, the president has touted the importance of the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, citing its purchases of U.S. military hardware, its oil riches and its strong opposition to Iran.\n\nFormer U.S. officials and regional experts say failing to put Saudi Arabia on notice could end up backfiring badly, and produce yet more violent extremism. By choking off any avenue for peaceful dissent, the Saudi regime could incubate future terrorists, who will seek to target both the Saudi royal family and its patrons in Washington, Farouk said.\n\nBut the Khashoggi killing, along with Saudi Arabia\u2019s disastrous military campaign in Yemen, has triggered outrage among both Republican and Democrats in Congress that could have long-term consequences for the kingdom. Lawmakers from both parties have vowed to push for legislation that would cut off arms sales to Saudi Arabia, impose mandatory sanctions for those responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death and require a U.S. government report on perpetrators of war crimes in Yemen.\n\nSen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Congress is committed to holding Saudi Arabia to account and that lawmakers would be watching closely for how Pompeo handles his visit to Riyadh.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope he refuses to play fast and loose with language giving the Saudis a free pass on these critical issues,\u201d Menendez told NBC News. \u201cHe should not use his visit as another empty photo op.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/britain-s-hunger-problem-requires-minister-dedicated-issue-lawmakers-say-n957046", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

An American warship is also being sent to the Black Sea as part of what the Navy described as \"routine operations.\"\n\nThose measures fell short of what Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko was hoping for \u2014 American and other NATO members' ships sailing through the Kerch Strait into the Sea of Azov.\n\nUkraine believes Putin is trying to blockade its ports and transform the Azov into a de facto Russian lake.\n\nJohn Herbst, who served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2003 to 2006 under President George W.

Pain that comes from sanctions and the pain that may come from providing weapons to Ukraine.\"\n\nHerbst said providing Kiev with anti-ship missiles and patrol ships would give Ukraine \"a partial asymmetric advantage in defending itself in the Sea of Azov.\"\n\nThe U.S. sold $47 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine in 2018 to help build its long-term defense capacity \u2014 something Herbst says many observers feared would exacerbate tensions with Moscow.\n\nHowever, that move was met with a \"weak response\" from the Kremlin, the former ambassador said.\n\n\"You can never rule out a major escalation, but I think the price for Putin of doing that is pretty high,\" Herbst added.\n\nKeir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London think tank, said fears of Russian retaliation, not just in Ukraine but potentially against the U.S. as well, would be an important consideration in any U.S. response to the naval clash.\n\nMichael McFaul, a U.S. ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama who is now a NBC News and MSNBC contributor, says he was surprised by the Trump administration's muted response to what he described as \u201can illegal detention\u201d of the Ukrainian sailors.\n\nA member of Russia's FSB security service escorts a detained Ukrainian navy sailor, right, before a court hearing in Simferopol, Crimea, on Nov. 27.

Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThough symbolic, Trump's summit with Kim last year was widely criticized for being vague on detail. The agreement they signed to \"work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\" did not define what \"denuclearization\" meant nor say how it might be achieved.\n\nNegotiations since then between Washington and Pyongyang have gained little ground. Ultimately, many experts and officials are skeptical whether Kim will ever grant Trump's wish of complete, verified denuclearization. Nuclear weapons are his family's only real insurance policy.\n\nIn the past year, North Korea has halted nuclear and missile tests, but it refuses to give any more ground on dismantling its weapons program until the U.S. starts repealing sanctions that are throttling its stunted economy.\n\nThat desire to expand the economy was a central theme in Kim's New Year address last week. One potential key to easing this pressure is China \u2014 North Korea's only major trading partner.\n\nTurning away from the U.S. and toward China was one interpretation of perhaps the most interesting line in Kim's speech last week. His threat to seek a \"new way\" to find peace on the Korean Peninsula was taken by some not as a threat to return to nuclear testing, but as a warning to Washington that it has other options.\n\nKim's Beijing visit was initially billed as ending Thursday but reports suggested he in fact left a day earlier than that. Few details have been released about the trip, which also included his wife, Ri Sol Ju, and other senior officials.\n\nThe young dictator arrives in Beijing at a time of delicate relations between his hosts and Washington.\n\nA day before his locomotive rolled into town, a U.S. delegation arrived hoping to ease a multibillion-dollar trade war with China.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and wife Ri Sol Ju at Pyongyang Station before leaving for China on Monday. Korean Central News Agency via AP\n\nAnother source of aggravation was exposed Monday when the U.S. further angered Beijing by sailing a warship through disputed waters in the South China Sea.\n\nBy visiting this week, not only is Kim likely sending a message to Washington by visiting Beijing, but he may be trying to exploit the Trump-Xi rift, many experts say.\n\nPersuading Beijing to break with Trump's \"maximum pressure\" sanctions policy could be one way to ease the economic pain on Pyongyang.\n\nFor Kim, now might be a good time to try.\n\nWe can read this visit in a number of ways: as Xi of #China seeking to exert influence over anticipated #Trump-Kim summit, Kim skillfully seeking to keep #Xi involved even as he embarks on bilateral diplomacy with US, Kim & Xi seeking to unnerve Trump w/a big show of friendship. \u2014 Jean H. Lee (@newsjean) January 8, 2019\n\nTrump is facing challenges at home with the partial government shutdown over his border wall, as well as abroad with the controversial decision to pull out of Syria and the subsequent departure of Defense Secretary James Mattis.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump can achieve at a second summit, given the gridlock that followed the first. North Korea might hope to inspire an impulsive concession from him, like last year when Trump offered to halt military exercises with South Korea, a move that appeared to blindside his own military.\n\n\"If Kim is as shrewd as appears to be, he probably recognizes that in some ways the momentum is with him \u2014 Trump is on the ropes,\" Nilsson-Wright said. \"So meeting Xi now is clever timing, I think, on Kim's part.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/turkey-s-erdogan-snubs-john-bolton-rift-between-nato-allies-n956011", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Lee\n\nANKARA, Turkey \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s plans for withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria were thrown into more uncertainty Tuesday as national security adviser John Bolton left the region after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan refused to meet with him. Bolton\u2019s mission to smooth a troop withdrawal with U.S. allies instead ended in only widening the rift with Turkey.\n\nThe path forward now appears more muddled than ever given Trump\u2019s demand for assurances that Turkey protect Syrian Kurds after U.S. troops depart and Erdogan\u2019s public snub of Bolton.\n\nA senior administration official told NBC News that Trump thought he had gotten a commitment from Erdogan in a Dec. 23 phone call that Turkey would protect the Syrian Kurds, who have been a key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State, after the American troops leave.\n\nBut a defiant Erdogan on Tuesday declined to meet with Bolton, who was in Turkey for talks about the withdrawal. In a speech to his political party, Erdogan said that Bolton had made a \"serious mistake\" in saying no U.S. troops would leave northeast Syria without such a commitment.\n\nErdogan said that Turkey would never compromise on the issue of the Syrian Kurds, or YPG Kurdish militia, which Turkey sees as a terrorist organization and part of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party.\n\n\u201cThose who cast aspersions on Turkey by claiming that it will massacre the Kurds in Syria are actually well aware of the facts behind the issue.\n\n\n\nThey aim to influence the international community and the decisions of those who are not quite familiar with the situation in Syria.\u201d \u2014 Turkish Presidency (@trpresidency) January 8, 2019\n\nPresident Erdo\u011fan: \u201cNowhere does Turkey go with the aim of eliminating any community or innocent people.\n\n\n\nWherever it goes, Turkey\u2019s sole aim is to protect lives and ensure security. The only exception is terrorist organizations and terrorists.\u201d pic.twitter.com/dNXUJwbpit \u2014 Turkish Presidency (@trpresidency) January 8, 2019\n\nBolton met for more than two hours earlier in the day with his Turkish counterpart, Ibrahim Kalin, the senior administration official, who was at the meeting, said. During that meeting, Bolton presented Kalin with a list of five conditions the U.S. has for withdrawing troops from Syria \u2014 items agreed to by Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and James Jeffrey, the U.S. envoy for Syria and the fight against ISIS, according to the senior administration official.\n\nThe list includes \"a negotiated solution to Turkish security concerns,\u201d the official said, and stipulates: \"We want the protection of all civilians, particularly local minority populations. We\u2019ll cooperate with Turkey on de-conflicting the airspace over northeast Syria. The United States opposes any mistreatment of opposition forces who fought with us against ISIS.\u201d\n\nTurkey rejected the proposal.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s fair to say that the United States stuck by the president\u2019s request as reflected in these points that the Kurds, that the opposition forces that fought with us, not be mistreated,\" the U.S. official said. \"And the Turks stuck by their position that the PYD and the YPG are terrorist groups and they\u2019re free to go after them.\" (The PYD, or Democratic Union Party, is the political wing of the YPG.)\n\nKalin told Bolton that Erdogan had committed Turkey to not taking offensive action in Syria while U.S. forces were there, the official said.\n\nThe official said Erdogan\u2019s speech on Tuesday was not at odds with the commitment Trump thought he had gotten from Erdogan during their Dec. 23 phone call.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said Erdogan called Kalin during their meeting and told him to send his regards to Bolton. However, Erdogan said he wouldn\u2019t be able to spend any time with Bolton because he was headed to Parliament to deliver a speech.\n\nA meeting between Bolton and Erdogan was never confirmed, a U.S. official said, but administration officials had said one was expected.\n\nSpeaking before Erdogan's remarks to Parliament, Marquis said Bolton and Kalin had \"a productive discussion\" and had \"identified further issues for dialogue.\"\n\nBolton\u2019s comments about Turkey over the weekend during an interview with reporters traveling with him in Israel had drawn criticism from Turkish officials.\n\nTrump announced Dec. 19 that all U.S. troops would immediately withdraw from Syria. The announcement, which shocked U.S. allies and members of Trump\u2019s own administration, stemmed from a phone call with Erdogan in which the Turkish leader convinced the president to withdraw and said Turkey would take over the fight against ISIS.\n\nPresident @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria....and he is a man who can do it plus, Turkey is right \u201cnext door.\u201d Our troops are coming home! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018\n\nU.S. officials have since tempered the timeline for withdrawal, saying there isn\u2019t one, and Trump has said a drawdown would happen slowly. But Bolton\u2019s comments Sunday to reporters in Israel marked the first time the U.S. put specific conditions on withdrawal and demanded an agreement from Turkey on the Kurds.\n\nErdogan said in his speech Tuesday that Turkey has completed preparations for a military operation in Syria. Turkey boasts NATO's second-largest military.\n\nDunford, Jeffrey and Turkey\u2019s deputy foreign and defense ministers also attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting with Bolton and Kal\u0131n.\n\nDunford remained in Turkey after Bolton leaves to continue discussions with Turkish officials about a way forward in Syria. Jeffrey plans to meet with the Syrian Kurds this week.\n\nOn Monday, Erdogan published an opinion article in The New York Times saying the Turkish government has \u201cno argument with the Syrian Kurds.\u201d\n\nHe called for a \u201cstabilization force\u201d in Syria that would be created by Turkey. To do so, Turkey would vet the Syrian Kurds who fought with the U.S. against ISIS and include those \u201cwith no links to terrorist organizations in the new stabilization force,\u201d Erdogan wrote.\n\n\u201cOnly a diverse body can serve all Syrian citizens and bring law and order to various parts of the country,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBolton told Kalin the op-ed was wrong and offensive, the senior administration official said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Erdogan was directly addressing remarks made by Bolton over the weekend when he wrote: \u201cTurkey intends to cooperate and coordinate our actions with our friends and allies.\u201d\n\nWhile Bolton told reporters Sunday that a U.S. withdrawal will be contingent on whether the White House can reach an agreement with Turkey on protecting the Kurds, he also said the time American troops will remain in Syria is not unlimited \u2014 adding \u201cthe primary point is we are going to withdraw from northeastern Syria.\u201d\n\nThe national security adviser\u2019s repeated caveat that the withdrawal is from northeastern Syria, not Syria overall, underscores a policy shift since Trump\u2019s Dec. 19 announcement that all American forces would leave Syria.\n\nWe have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency. \u2014 Donald J.

Failing to comply with this can result in an organizer serving up to six months in prison and paying a $8,574 fine. The new penalties that would be proposed under Philippe's proposed legislation were not immediately clear.\n\nAuthorities have been able to fine demonstrators who wear masks \"in circumstances which appear to infringe public order\" since 2009, according to French media reports.\n\nThat has not stopped some protesters from wearing masks.\n\nThe \u201cyellow vests\u201d are named after their fluorescent yellow garb. They are expected to hold protests for the ninth consecutive week on Saturday.\n\nWhat started as a largely peaceful movement has in recent weeks been prone to outbreaks of violence, with some protesters burning cars, looting stores and clashing with police.\n\nPhilippe said 80,000 members of the security forces and 5,000 police officers would be deployed across France this weekend to maintain public order.\n\nPart of the government's challenge in appeasing and clamping down on the \"yellow vests\" is that the group is somewhat amorphous and does not have clear leaders or objectives.\n\nThe protesters appear to united by a general discontent over for the high cost of living in France and Macron's reformist agenda."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/american-isis-members-are-detained-syria-u-s-backed-coalition-n955186", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Now his administration is in a frantic search for solutions, including a renewed look at sending the most dangerous fighters to Guantanamo Bay, U.S. and congressional officials tell NBC News.\n\nThe scramble has been complicated by the fact that the timeline for the planned U.S. withdrawal keeps evolving, with Trump and his aides giving shifting descriptions of how fast the troops are leaving. The ISIS detainees are being held in Syria by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces, who have warned they may have to let the ISIS fighters go if a feared onslaught by Turkish forces occurs.\n\nAmid the tumult, U.S. diplomats and military officials have been making urgent appeals to foreign countries to take back foreign fighters who went to fight in Syria and were apprehended, so they can be imprisoned and prosecuted in their home countries. It's an appeal the U.S. has been making for several years in anticipation of an eventual U.S. withdrawal, but nearly every country has refused.\n\nThe sun rises over Camp Delta detention compound at Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in 2008. Brennan Linsley / Pool via AFP - Getty Images\n\nNow the U.S. warning to embassies is more desperate: Trump's decision is real, the U.S. is leaving Syria, and the issue must be resolved quickly to ensure ISIS fighters aren't released and rejoin the battle. It comes amid a frenzied effort to turn the president's abrupt decision into workable policy, a period that one former U.S. official described as \"chaotic,\" as officials \"search for guidance\" from the White House that is not forthcoming.\n\nThe White House's National Security Council declined to comment.\n\nThe basic understanding of Trump's intentions keeps changing, from a decision to withdraw all troops within a month to a slower withdrawal over four months and now, an exit with no specified timeline. After broad bipartisan concern about a hasty withdrawal, the administration now says some troops could remain in Syria for an indefinite amount of time.\n\n\"There are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal,\" national security adviser John Bolton said Sunday during a trip to Israel.\n\nAmid the shifting policy, the White House has given national security officials no written guidance on how to proceed, several officials said. At a meeting last week with the State Department coordinator for counterterrorism, Nathan Sales, there were no firm answers about what the administration wants to do, officials familiar with the meeting said. The State Department had no comment on the meeting.\n\nAbsent any clear instructions, officials are discussing options based on what they presume Trump and Bolton want to hear, one official said. The National Counter Terrorism Center, part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, is involved in the planning along with the State Department and the Pentagon.\n\nTo tackle the problem, the U.S. has separated the list of detainees into three categories: most dangerous, mid-level fighters and some leaders, and the more general fighters, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the planning. The most dangerous fighters are the ones under consideration to send to the detention facility at Guantanamo, which the president has repeatedly threatened to \"load up\" with \"some bad dudes.\"\n\nKaren Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University, says there is precedent for quickly and secretly moving prisoners into Guantanamo Bay.\n\n\"Recall what happened in 2001,\" she said, \"the U.S. set up Guantanamo in 96 hours. It could happen very fast.\"\n\nGreenberg, author of The Least Worst Place, a book about the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, reminds that the first planeload of detainees arrived in Cuba almost exactly 17 years ago, on January 11, 2002. The current discussions without much actual policy guidance from the White House is reminiscent of the 2001 scramble to find a place to detain nearly 800 fighters.\n\nBut unlike in Afghanistan, where the U.S. military collected evidence against al-Qaida fighters as they picked them up on the battlefield, the ISIS fighters in Syria are not in U.S. custody, making it harder to build cases against them that would hold up in the U.S. or other legal systems.\n\n\"These detainees were not apprehended by the United States and have no connection to the United States,\" said Ambassador Lee Wolosky, the former U.S. special envoy for closing Guantanamo in the Obama administration. \"They should be returned to their countries of origin for prosecution and incarceration.\"\n\nThe ISIS fighters are being held in makeshift facilities run by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a mostly Kurdish coalition of fighters that the U.S. has relied heavily on for years to fight ISIS on the front lines. Fearing a post-withdrawal onslaught by Turkey, which considers the Kurdish fighters to be terrorists, Kurdish officials have threatened that they might have to simply release the ISIS fighters so they can focus on self-preservation.\n\nDespite that threat, U.S. officials said it's considered unlikely that the Kurdish forces would let the ISIS fighters free \u2013 unless Turkey invades to attack them. Turkey considers the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces to be an offshoot of the PKK, a Kurdish group deemed by the U.S. to be terrorists who have waged a two-decade insurgency against Turkey's government.\n\nIf Turkey does attack, as has been widely feared in the wake of Trump's decision, the Kurdish forces in Syria would have to redirect all their resources to defending their territory and could release the ISIS prisoners, officials said.\n\nThat concern may be one reason that Trump's team is putting a renewed emphasis on trying to prevent Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from - as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put it last week - \"slaughtering the Kurds.\"\n\nAhead of a visit to Ankara, Bolton said an agreement from Turkey not to attack Syrian Kurdish forces was now a prerequisite to a U.S. withdrawal. Erdogan has long sought a U.S. exit from Syria and had offered to Trump that his military would take over and finish off the remaining ISIS fighters operating in Syria, NBC News has reported.\n\nTwo of the detainees held in Syria, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, are suspected of having taken part in the torture and murder of American and other Western hostages. They were captured one year ago and have been dubbed \"the Beatles\" because of their British accents.\n\nThe Trump administration, at the urging of some Republican lawmakers, has considered transferring them to the Guantanamo detention camp. But Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire has appealed to the administration to try them in federal courts, arguing that flawed military commissions for Guantanamo inmates have provided fodder for extremist propaganda. Shaheen has worked closely with the parents of James Foley, the American journalist who was murdered by Islamic State in 2014.\n\nThe president's \"hasty decision to withdraw American forces from Syria betrays the trust that Syrian Democratic Forces have put in the U.S., and risks unraveling our efforts to bring these terrorists to justice,\" Shaheen told NBC News in an email.\n\nAnother major dilemma facing the administration: more than 2,000 family members of ISIS fighters who also must be dealt with. The wives and children are not in prison but in separate sections of camps in Syria for internally displaced people, officials said.\n\nA few countries, including France and Belgium, have started talking about taking back some of the families who originated from their countries, but the problem is far from solved.\n\nHuman rights groups have insisted the issue must be solved before the U.S. forces come out, arguing that local Kurdish authorities are not equipped to keep holding them or put them on trial. But Human Rights Watch also emphasized that detainees should not be transferred to countries known to practice torture or for tainted court trials, including neighboring Iraq, where the group said the U.S. has already sent at least five of the detainees.\n\n\"The issue of the foreign detainees \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 should be a key priority for any planning for U.S. withdrawal from northern Syria, said Nadim Houry, who runs the group's terrorism and counterterrorism program. \"The local authorities in northern Syria should not be left to deal with this international issue on their own.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/mideast-farmers-who-use-pesticides-often-find-no-buyers-abroad-n949826", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

This is despite the fact many of these chemicals are manufactured by companies based in Europe and North America.\n\nSameer Mahadin said he had to leave his tomatoes to rot in the ground at this farm on the south end of the Dead Sea in Jordan because it wasn't worth the labor to harvest them.\n\nThe increasingly dry climate has forced him to rely more on irrigation, fertilizers and chemicals to maintain strong yields, he said. But that also has limited his ability to sell them abroad.\n\nCompounded with the war in neighboring Syria \u2014 a market he used to rely on with similar pesticide policies to Jordan's \u2014 and he accrued more than $210,000 in debt in just one season.\n\nThe use of pesticides globally isn't slowing, according to Jules Pretty, a professor of environment and society at the University of Essex in England. The ease of getting rid of pests and diseases and the potential to increase yields significantly outweigh the negative effects for individual farmers.\n\nEvery year, 7.7 billion pounds of active ingredients are used, Pretty said. That's despite the fact the chemicals can cause a range of environmental and health problems from deadly poisoning of farm workers to longer-term effects on the immune system from exposure to residues, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nA farmer sprays pesticides at a cucumber field near Ahmedabad, India. AMIT DAVE / Reuters\n\nThe U.S., China and Argentina \u2014 making up nearly a quarter of the world's population \u2014 are the largest consumers by volume of pesticides, accounting for 70 percent of the $45 billion global market.\n\nBut while a study published last year found that countries in the Middle East and North Africa are in a \"prime location\" to export food to Europe, many are unable to meet safety standards.\n\nPoorer countries don't manufacture pesticides locally. They are either made by Western companies that have the expertise or if a chemical's patent is expired, they are often produced by manufacturers in India or China.\n\nThere is a global standard, the Codex Alimentarius, that serves as a baseline for ensuring food safety and creates fairness in international trade. But individual countries and regions still set their own standards, which can be more rigorous than the codex and result in discrepancies.\n\nChlorpyrifos, a pesticide widely used in farming, is one example of such uneven policies. The U.S. government is appealing a federal court order banning its use, but it is legal in Jordan and other countries.\n\nThe regulatory inequality in part stems from patent protections, said Rudolph Guyer, the former head of the plant science network CropLife Middle East. Chemical companies spend millions to develop new pesticide compounds and in turn want to protect patents to help recoup those costs.\n\nCountries that fail to enforce patent laws leave too much opportunity for counterfeits to emerge. To avoid the potential losses, companies don\u2019t bother to register their products in those countries, meaning it is never authorized to enter their markets. This limits the scope and quality of chemicals available to farmers, Guyer said.\n\nThen there are differences in climate and crops \u2014 such as pineapples or cacao \u2014 that require the use of chemicals that aren\u2019t needed in Western countries.\n\nThe use of chemicals banned or restricted in other countries doesn\u2019t entirely restrict farmers from exporting their crops. Receiving countries set standards on the acceptable level of residue that can be found on food items.\n\nBut local pesticide distributors may lock farmers into contracts to use their products without making clear the consequences, Jules said.\n\nHe said farmers weren't being told in advance that \"if you use compound X it could lead to residues of a certain amount getting into your products, which means you can\u2019t sell to North America or Europe.\"\n\nJordan\u2019s director of agricultural marketing, Ayman Al-Salti, said the government is working with farmers to teach them how to appropriately apply pesticides to prevent excess residue.\n\nFor small farms that produce crop for local markets, there are other consequences from using chemicals.\n\n\u201cThey have side effects, they have environmental costs and health costs outside the farm,\u201d Pretty said, likening the harm from pesticides to smoke from a factory.\n\nCompounds that knock out an insect, weed or parasite could be affecting other organisms, and that can take time to become apparent.\n\nThe popularity of the insecticide neonicotinoids within the last decade has been linked to the sudden decline of pollinators, including bees, throughout Europe and the U.S., Pretty said. Products containing the compound have since been restricted or banned in those regions to try to revive those populations.\n\nOther consequences include pests building up resistance to certain compounds and the degradation of soil.\n\nFor these reasons, a U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food released a report last year calling for a legally binding protocol imposing tougher regulations on pesticide use globally and moving away from harmful industrial agricultural practices.\n\n\"Reliance on hazardous pesticides is a short-term solution that undermines the rights to adequate food and health for present and future generations,\" the report stated.\n\nApart from tightening restrictions on pesticide use, farmers need help and encouragement to pick up more sustainable practices, experts say.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization runs education programs around the globe teaching farmers how to use natural pest-control techniques in the place of chemicals without taking a hit to their yields and profit.\n\nOrganic farmer Riyadh Yousef Marror at his farm in Jordan.

Lee\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 President Donald Trump will not withdraw American troops from northern Syria until the Turkish government guarantees it won\u2019t then attack Syrian Kurdish forces that have been critical allies in the fight against ISIS, national security adviser John Bolton said Sunday.\n\nBolton said a commitment from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that protects the Kurds after American forces exit is something Trump is demanding, and that it\u2019s just one of several conditions that have to be met before U.S. troops leave.\n\n\u201cThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nJohn Bolton is shown around Jerusalem's Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray. Carol E. Lee\n\nHe spoke to reporters traveling with him to Israel and Turkey as he tried to clarify Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal policy for allies. He\u2019s meeting with Israeli officials Sunday and Monday, and with Turkish officials, including Erdogan, on Tuesday.\n\nSince Trump abruptly announced on Dec. 19 that all U.S. forces in Syria would exit immediately, administration officials have shifted the timing to say it would happen more slowly. Officials are now setting a series of conditions for withdrawal that must first be met, which Bolton described as \u201cpolicy decisions that we need to implement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a cause and effect mission,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cTimetables or the timing of the withdrawal occurs as a result of the fulfillment of the conditions and the establishment of the circumstances that we want to see. And once that\u2019s done, then you talk about a timetable.\u201d\n\nBolton also indicated that the U.S. troop withdrawal will not be a complete drawdown, as Trump had promised. Instead, he discussed a withdrawal of American forces from northern Syria, where most of the estimated 2,000 U.S. troops are based, while leaving some of them in the southern part of the country.\n\nStressing that despite conditions for withdrawal,the continued presence of U.S. forces in Syria is not unlimited.\n\n\u201cThe primary point is we are going to withdraw from northeastern Syria,\" Bolton said.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s going to be a different environment after we leave, there is no question about that,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there is no desire to see Iran\u2019s influence spread that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nTrump also commented Sunday on the timing of the withdrawal. \"I never said we\u2019d be doing it that quickly,\" the president said from the White House. \"We won\u2019t be finally pulled out, until ISIS is gone.\u201d\n\nThe remark came in contrast to the president's statement from Dec. 19., when he said the withdrawal would happen quickly and that the U.S. had defeated ISIS. \"Our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now,\" Trump said at the time. \"We won.\"\n\nIn his remarks delivered abroad, Bolton also touched on a key base where the U.S. and other allies have a couple hundred troops stationed.\n\n\"Then there is the Al Tanf garrison, which is still very strategically important in connection with our determination that Iran not achieve this arc of control stretching from Iran through Iraq into Lebanon and into Syria,\" he said.\n\nAl Tanf started out as a base to train fighters against ISIS but has morphed into playing a critical role in the U.S. effort to diminish Iran's influence in the region.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the U.S.\u2019s legal justification would be for maintaining troops there, although Bolton cited Article II of the Constitution, which names the president the Commander-in-Chief of the country's armed forces.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s plenty of legal justification about concern for the resurgence of ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a strong believer in Article II, and I think that what that means is the president has full authority to protect American and allied interests anywhere around the world.\u201d\n\nIran is the main focus of Bolton\u2019s meetings in Israel. Al Tanf is located along a critical road that stretches from Tehran to Baghdad to Damascus and sits in the heart of what Iran hopes will be part of a \"Shiite Crescent\u201d \u2014 a continuous land bridge linking Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon.\n\nWhile Trump's withdrawal announcement was greeted with dismay in Israel, which sees U.S. involvement in the region as key to constraining Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Bolton warmly and called him an \"old friend.\"\n\n\"I will discuss with his people efforts to stop the Iranian aggression in our region, the situation in Syria \u2014 following President Trump's decision,\" he said at the start of a Cabinet meeting Sunday. \"Our position is clear \u2014 we continue to act against the Iranian military buildup in Syria, including these days, and we are acting against anyone who undermines or tries to undermine Israel's security.\"\n\nIn Turkey, Bolton will face a defiant Erdogan, who considers the Kurdish forces in Syria to be terrorists who threaten Turkey's stability.\n\nHe warned Turkey against taking any military action in Syria without consent from the U.S.\n\n\"We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, at a minimum so they don't endanger our troops, but also so that they meet the president\u2019s requirement that the Syrian opposition forces that have fought with us are not endangered,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nHe said the U.S. has \u201ctold the Kurds our best judgment is that you stand fast now.\u201d\n\nErdogan's spokesman said on Sunday it was irrational to claim Turkey targets Kurds, saying Ankara's targets were ISIS militants and the Kurdish groups YPG and PKK, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nBolton will be joined in Ankara by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and Ambassador James Jeffrey, who was named Friday as the Special Envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\n\nHe said Dunford will remain in Turkey after Tuesday to continue discussions with Turkish officials."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/britain-hires-87-trucks-to-test-highway-conditions-of-possible-no-deal-brexit-1421149251691", "text": "Britain hires 87 trucks to test highway conditions of possible \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit 01:04 copied!\n\nThe British government used an airport runway and hired 87 trucks to test the possible effects of leaving the E.U. without a trade deal.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/snowflakes-wanted-british-army-rolls-out-millennial-recruitment-campaign-n954101", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It\u2019s the only day of the week her apartment building receives water, and she has to make the most of it.\n\n\u201cI can't do anything else but focus on the water,\" she said.\n\nJordan has struggled with its water supply for decades. The arid nation receives roughly 20 days of rain per year and climate change is making conditions worse just as water demands from the growing population increase.\n\nAt the center of the government's efforts to obtain more of this precious resource is a patch of desert swirling with dust devils about 32 miles south of Amman.\n\nSeven new wells are scheduled to be built here to tap the Disi, a deep aquifer that contains so-called fossil water that accumulated 10,000 to 30,000 years ago. It's the last source of fresh groundwater for the country, experts say.\n\n\"After this, we are out of chances,\" said Marwan Al-Raggad, a hydrogeology professor at the University of Jordan.\n\nReaching it requires drilling about twice as deep as groundwater aquifers \u2014 which are typically 1,640 feet underground and refilled by rainwater.\n\n\u201cIt means huge energy is needed to extract this water,\u201d said Ali Subah, general secretary of Jordan's water and irrigation ministry. \u201cIt will be expensive.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development is funding the project, which is currently in the planning stage. Construction is anticipated to begin next year. The wells will produce an estimated 5.3 billion gallons of water for the people of Amman. It will also provide data on the complex prehistoric underground water system that researchers are still working to understand.\n\nThe journey the fossil water will take from ground to tap in this region is unlike anywhere else in the world.\n\nSpecialized drills and equipment are required to access the water, Subah said. A treatment facility and complex series of pipelines and pumping stations are also required to elevate the water from at least 3,281 feet underground to Amman, which is 3,084 feet above sea level.\n\nThe Jordanian capital currently gets its water from a treatment plant that's between the northern edge of the Dead Sea and the celebrated baptism site of Jesus on the Jordan River.\n\nA bridge spans the dried-up Wadi Mujib riverbed. Philipp Breu / Philipp Breu\n\nBefore it makes the uphill climb to Amman, the brackish water, salty from the spring sources, must be cleaned and desalinated.\n\nThen, it travels through six pumping stations and reservoirs connected by pipelines over a 25-mile stretch before being distributed across the city\u2019s water network.\n\nIt\u2019s a technically challenging and expensive system, with power accounting for 90 percent of its operating costs, according to Haitham Al-Kilani, the plant's production director.\n\nInside the Dead Sea Water Treatment plant. Philipp Breu / for NBC News\n\nIn an attempt to reduce expenses, the facility is launching a pilot project to install solar panels that will provide up to 5 percent of the energy required, Al-Kilani said.\n\nWhile the plant's rain-fed sources don't appear to be at risk of running out, Al-Kilani said that the rainy season appears to be getting shorter and now starts in mid-November instead of September.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big change,\u201d he said, \u201cThe amount of rain, it\u2019s declined in the last 10 years. This is climate change, it is fact.\u201d\n\nThe treatment plant can't keep up with the capital's growing demand for water, officials said.\n\nAn influx of at least 670,000 Syrian refugees, population growth and aging infrastructure have all placed pressure on the system.\n\nFor residents of Amman like Qisi, the effects are hitting their wallets. Since the war in Syria broke out seven years ago, she said her water bill shot up, now costing three to four times more than in the past.\n\nEvery unit in her building has a tank on the roof that is filled up on water day to sustain them through the week \u2014 typical for homes across Jordan. As long as Qisi manages household use through the week, taps typically don\u2019t run dry.\n\nKhawla Qisi recycles water from washing vegetables in her kitchen to use in her garden at her home in Amman, Jordan. Ziad Jaber / NBC News\n\nBut it\u2019s not a fool proof system and there's the challenge of visitors.\n\n\"If my family is visiting \u2014 say you have guests, an event \u2014 you can't tell them they can't clean themselves, don't use water,\" she said. \"So in these situations, you're not focused on saving water and the water runs out.\"\n\nThe University of Jordan's Al-Raggad said most sources of groundwater in the country have already been \"exploited.\"\n\nDeep aquifers like the Disi can help fill the gap, but they are a finite resource, Al-Raggad explained.\n\nThe Disi is vast, extending from Jordan through Saudi Arabia. Wells near the border, where the water is not as deep, have depleted it since the 1980s, reducing its expected lifespan from 100 years to about 50.\n\nLonger term, the country is also exploring major desalination projects. Jordan\u2019s short southern coastline sits on the Red Sea, but unlike neighboring Saudi Arabia and Israel, which have heavily invested in the technology over many years, Jordan only opened its first facility in 2017.\n\nThe end of Wadi Mujib, one of three main water sources for the Dead Sea water treatment plant.

Attacks and bombings continue to occur throughout the country and remnants of ISIS still hold territory in remote and rural areas, he said.\n\nWhile citizens have the right to anonymously provide information to authorities, there is a great deal of negligence on the part of Iraq\u2019s intelligence service in handling or taking interest in tips, said security expert al-Hashimi. But violations, particularly by officers outside the capital, are difficult to prove to the leadership in Baghdad.\n\nIt\u2019s resulted in fears of backlash for reporting suspected ISIS followers to authorities.\n\nAl-Nuaimi recounted that someone was assassinated in her neighborhood after doing so.\n\nFrustration with the government over issues ranging from security to services is becoming increasingly prevalent among Iraqis, according to Renad Mansour, a research fellow specializing in Iraq at the U.K.'s Chatham House think tank.\n\n\u201cCitizens are saying they are fed up with the process,\u201d Mansour said. \u201cSo more and more people are going to the streets, people are protesting, people are looking at violent ways to take down the regime.\u201d\n\nProtests against the government turned deadly in the southern city of Basra earlier this year and Mansour said the situation is likely to erupt again unless basic services such as sanitation and water dramatically improve.\n\nGlobal watchdog Transparency International ranks Iraq as one of the world's most corrupt countries, with a score of 18 out of 100 \u2014 with 0 being \u201chighly corrupt.\u201d\n\nDwindling faith in political institutions, compounded by a lack of economic opportunity and failing services, create an environment in which ISIS can thrive, Mansour said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic organization, it can understand what the main grievances are and try to act as a representative for these disenfranchised populations,\u201d Mansour added. \u201cIf corruption is rampant and if the economy doesn't improve, ISIS will be back.\"\n\nPart of the problem is that the U.S. and allied forces have focused on territorial military tactics, not the underlying problems that lead people to join the group, Mansour said. The retreat from Syria is a clear example of that.\n\n\u201cIf you bomb them and take over their territorial rule, it\u2019s a job done.

It also tested its most powerful nuclear weapon to date, which it claimed was a miniaturized hydrogen bomb.\n\nVerbal sparring between Trump and Kim escalated and appeared to elevate the threat of a devastating war.\n\nThen it all stopped. North Korea conducted its last nuclear test in September 2017 and its last missile launch a month later. Trump has gone from ridiculing Kim as \"little rocket man\" to saying he \"fell in love\" with the young dictator.\n\n\"The missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction, nuclear testing has stopped,\" Trump told the United Nations General Assembly in September.\n\nThe president has pointed to this as evidence that his strategy to defang Kim's government is working.\n\nHowever, many experts point out that although the eye-catching weapons displays may have ceased, other more subtle parts of North Korea's weapons program continue apace. Tests are only part of the story.\n\n\"Kim has not changed his policy ... but claims that he's now moved from research-and-development and onto mass production,\" said Cristina Varriale, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.\n\nNorth Korea continues to produce fissile material and develop missile bases around the country, according to experts and analysis of detailed satellite images.\n\nThis transition from testing to production should come as no surprise \u2014 it's exactly what Kim told the world he would do at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn his New Year's Day address, Kim claimed that his scientists and engineers had completed all the trial runs they needed. Now, he said bluntly, \"the nuclear weapons research sector and the rocket industry should mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles.\"\n\nAt the current rate of production, North Korea could have around 100 warheads by 2020 \u2014 almost half the size of the U.K.'s stockpile, according to Robert S. Litwak, senior vice president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a Washington think tank.\n\nPaul Cheung / NBC News\n\nAside from the pause in testing, Trump also takes credit for North Korea's claim that it destroyed its nuclear testing site at Punggye-ri.\n\nHowever, this demolition is unconfirmed, reversible and even irrelevant in terms of producing more warheads, experts warn.\n\nNo promises to break\n\nNorth Korea's continued activity is sometimes portrayed as some sort of deception. But even South Korea points out that Kim is not deceiving anyone because he made no concrete promises in the first place.\n\nWhile Trump and Kim pledged to \"work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\" at their historic summit in June, their joint declaration was so vague that it has been widely dismissed as almost meaningless.\n\nJust landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2018\n\nFor one, the U.S. and North Korea disagree about what \"denuclearization\" actually means. Rather than a one-way street, the North has suggested it should involve the U.S. removing its troops from the region and backing away from the nuclear umbrella Washington offers South Korea and Japan.\n\nHwasong-15 missiles are shown off during a military parade on Feb. 8. KCNA via KNS / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nThis ambiguity has led to stalemate in the months since, with American and North Korean negotiators insisting the other be the first to offer concessions.\n\nThe North Koreans have appeared reluctant to deal with Trump's subordinates, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Some believe they would prefer to exploit the president's perceived impulsiveness, like when he gave an on-the-spot concession to Kim that he would halt large war games with South Korea, appearing to blindside his own military.\n\nIn recent weeks, the stalled negotiations have threatened to backslide further.\n\nEarlier in December, the U.S. slapped more sanctions on North Korea, this time on three high-profile officials over alleged human rights abuses. In response, Pyongyang warned of a return to the \"exchanges of fire\" of last year.\n\nCVID or bust\n\nTrump and his team say they want something many experts and even the CIA believe is impossible while Kim is still in power: the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear arsenal.\n\nThis holy grail of denuclearization even has its own acronym \u2014 CVID.\n\nMany experts and intelligence officials believe North Korea will never willingly give up its nuclear weapons, especially ones that might be able to strike the U.S., because Kim's regime believes they are its best insurance policy against invasion.\n\nThis reality has led many observers to urge the U.S. to pursue more modest short-term goals, with the intention of deterring and containing the world's youngest nuclear power.\n\n\"Only with this kind of predictable and agreed-upon working quid pro quo will each side stop assuming the intentions of the other are insincere,\" according to George Lopez, a former member of the United Nations Panel of Experts on North Korean sanctions.\n\nOne man who's already been doing this is South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nMoon says he's also committed to denuclearization. But instead of Trump's zero-sum game, he has welcomed intermediate steps along the way, building inter-Korean cooperation on the economy and peace.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks with Kim Jong Un during June's summit in Singapore. Kevin Lim / Reuters file\n\nChina has also played its part. The few concessions that North Korea and the U.S. have given up this year look remarkably similar to a proposal by Beijing that Washington and Pyongyang go \"freeze for freeze.\"\n\nThis has led to speculation that Kim did a deal in private with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"I don't think it is entirely coincidental that Kim met with Xi three times in a very short period of time,\" says Varriale at RUSI.\n\nTrump's role\n\nAlthough missile and nuclear tests are perhaps not the game-changer Trump suggests, there are some who give the president some credit for stopping them and bringing North Korea to the negotiating table.\n\nTrump has broken the mold in two ways. He appeared more willing than any of his recent predecessors to countenance what would be a devastating war. And he was the first sitting president to meet face-to-face with a North Korean ruler.\n\nNorth Korea's Hwasong-15, which is believed to be an intercontinental ballistic missile, is successfully launched near Pyongyang in November 2017. KCNA / Reuters file\n\n\"North Korean leaders did not want their country to be bombed so they stopped testing,\" says Andrei Lankov, a professor at South Korea's Kookmin University.\n\nThe subsequent summit in June \"changed the U.S.-North Korea dynamic \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 reducing tensions and opening up space for diplomacy with both the U.S. and South Korea,\" says David Wright a co-director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nTrump has been able to turn down the temperature, so the theory goes, but only because he was willing to take it to a potentially catastrophic boiling point. It's worth noting, Wright says, that any goodwill Trump accrued has been squandered since the summit.\n\nVipin Narang, a politics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has another take.\n\nHe believes that Trump knows Kim will never denuclearize \u2014 and that he doesn't care. This is because stopping missile tests, rather than actual denuclearization itself, may be enough for Trump to claim success on North Korea and enjoy a political win, Narang said.\n\n\"Trump probably rightly calculates that so long as the diplomatic process is ongoing, the testing moratorium will as well,\" he said. \"So he has an incentive to keep the reality show going.\"\n\nThis could suit Kim, too. While gridlocked negotiations and halted tests may enable Trump to claim victory, it also allows North Korea to build up its arsenal."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-s-reveal-seal-team-iraq-could-endanger-its-members-n952521", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Lee later said Trump told him, \"Hey, in that case, let\u2019s take a picture.\"\n\nThe ensuing photos and video revealed the presence of the special operations forces, something some experts have said is generally frowned upon if not verboten in war zones.\n\nHowever, the Office of the Secretary of Defense said in a statement that no rules were violated.\n\n\"The special operators voluntarily participated in this open press event,\" the secretary's public affairs arm stated. \"There was no security violation.\"\n\nRetired U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis addressed the matter Thursday on \"MSNBC Live with Hallie Jackson.\"\n\n\"It's important he's a SEAL,\" Stavridis said of the chaplain. \"That's a part of the force that is historically supposed to be very, very cloistered, very much in the shadows.

He added that all field commanders had also been told to intensify training efforts to capture four strategic provinces in the run up to the next round of talks between the U.S. and Taliban, which are expected in January.\n\nA Taliban leader in eastern Kunar province, Maulvi Sher Mohammad, said news of withdrawals should serve as a lesson to Americans.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. people and particularly its rulers should think about what they achieved by invading Afghanistan and by causing so many losses to the citizens of Afghanistan and wasting their own resources on this long war,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment on the Taliban's claims.\n\nSo far, the U.S.'s military campaign, along with billions in aid, have not succeeded in driving out the Taliban and other militants or making the country safe.\n\nIn 2017, Afghanistan overtook Iraq to become the deadliest country for terrorism, with one-quarter of all such deaths worldwide happening there. And the number of civilians killed in the country reached a record in the first half of this year, with a surge in suicide attacks claimed by the Islamic State group, according to the United Nations.\n\nDespite years of fighting, only around 65 percent of the Afghan population lives in areas under government control.\n\nThe U.S. plans for a withdrawal were due shortly after the new year, according to two defense officials and a person briefed on the matter.

Since then, the militants have been trying to unseat the U.S.-backed government in Kabul and reimpose their strict version of Shariah. Successes on the battlefield coupled with a recent intensifying efforts to reach a peace deal led by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad have boosted the movement's confidence and power.\n\nKhalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Afghanistan and the United Nations, has stressed he is \"in a hurry\" to secure an agreement, a sign of how eager the White House is to withdraw the 15,000 American troops remaining in the country.\n\nBut reducing the U.S. footprint in Afghanistan would mean fewer U.S. air bases, and American firepower will be \u201cless responsive and less available\u201d for Afghan troops fighting Taliban militants, said Jason Campbell, a former senior Defense Department official and now a policy researcher at the RAND Corp. think tank.\n\nPlans to scale back the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan comes after Washington pressed NATO allies this year to keep troops in the country, and some governments \u2014 including Britain \u2014 agreed to expand their contributions following an appeal from Defense Secretary James Mattis, who resigned on Thursday.\n\nThe news shocked and confused NATO allies and the Afghan government, at a moment when the United States is engaged in a major diplomatic push to try to launch peace negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe abruptness of this I think really hurts our credibility,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nFor Khalilzad, the move deprives him of his most effective point of leverage before negotiations even have begun in earnest, experts and former officials said.\n\n\u201cIt will have a devastating effect on peace negotiations,\u201d said Seth Jones, a former adviser to the U.S. military now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\n\u201cThe challenge now the U.S. faces is how is it going to get the Taliban to reach an agreement if they can wait and expect a better outcome in the future if the U.S. continues to withdraw its forces?\u201d\n\nMushtaq Yusufzai reported from Peshawar, Pakistan, F.

Water scarcity has been attributed to playing a role in Syria\u2019s civil war and the spread of militant groups such as Boko Haram in the Lake Chad basin.\n\nThe warning system being developed uses a range of data including hydrological information and satellite imaging to monitor and calculate risks to water access around the globe. To determine the risk for conflicts, it tracks media reports in more than 100 languages by flagging a list of keywords in real time.\n\nThe data has limitations. Satellite imaging runs into challenges with cloud cover or certain topographical characteristics, said Karen Meijer, a researcher at the Dutch institute Deltares that develops tools to monitor water resources.\n\nThe figures needed may not exist or be outdated, since the system largely relies on publicly available \"open\" data, Meijer said. Governments withholding data about reservoirs andother infrastructure may also prove to be a challenge.\n\nThe warning-system tool is being trained to consider the many combinations of conflict-triggering factors from weak governments to local disputes to identify potential flashpoints.\n\nThe findings it generates will not be as thorough as a scientific study for regions flagged as potential hotspots, Meijer said, but it will help those in power to make informed decisions.\n\n\u201cInternational policy action is quite often driven by short-term considerations,\u201d Schmeier said.\n\nBuilding more wells in response to a looming drought appears logical, she said, as an example. But those wells could have negative impacts, fueling animosity by seemingly prioritizing one community over others or dangerously depleting the resource \u2014 interconnected issues that the warning system aims to expose.\n\nDrought forecasting has become increasingly accurate for periods of six months into the future for many regions. It played an important role in mitigating the effects of drought in Ethiopia and Kenya in 2015, according to Micha Werner, associate professor in hydraulic engineering at IHE Delft. But forecasts were less effective in Somalia which didn\u2019t have similar capacities to take action.\n\nDroughts can cost countries billions of dollars, so even a 10 percent reduction on the impact is beneficial, he said. \u201cBut you need the political will to do that.\u201d\n\nForecasters have warned that the coming year could be particularly bad for Australia, southern Africa and much of northern South America, thanks to predictions of a weak El Nino weather system for 2019.\n\nColombia's Environment Minister Ricardo Lozano has called for action, warning that the phenomenon could cause rainfall deficits of up to 80 percent there in the first three months of next year. He warned that could result in more forest fires, failed crops, and water shortages that may force rationing.\n\nEl Nino has already delayed the rainy season for eastern Africa and resulted in a shortfall of rain in southern countries including Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. It follows persistent dry conditions that contributed to Cape Town's \"Day Zero\" scare.\n\nThe phenomenon could result in inconsistent rainfall for the Horn of Africa, bringing downpours and floods or extend dry conditions. To prepare for the worst, Henry Karemeri Ndungu, climate change specialist for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Kenya, said the organization maintains a stockpile of supplies and evacuation facilities.\n\nIn southern Africa, the Red Cross and its partners are also monitoring and preparing for food shortages caused by drought.\n\n\u201cThe mantra is prevention is better than cure,\u201d Ndungu said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/beijing-eyes-two-child-policy-u-turn-lonely-generation-has-n949291", "text": "Beijing claims that 400 million births were prevented as a result of the policy from 1980 to 2005.\n\nBut the the rule's strict enforcement was seen as a violation of human and reproductive rights by critics.\n\nAs a result of China\u2019s traditional preference for male offspring, especially in rural areas, many woman who were carrying female babies were forced to get abortions.\n\nChinese doctors performed more than 330 million abortions and 196 million sterilizations since 1971, according to official data from the Chinese Health Ministry released in March 2013 and reported by the Financial Times and other international news organizations.\n\nIf the mothers did give birth, girls were often abandoned, placed in orphanages or given up for adoption abroad.\n\nBy the end of 2014, China had 33.76 million more males then females. For every 100 girls, there were 116 boys.\n\n\u201cThe policy clearly skewed the population structure in many ways,\u201d said Cai Yong, a professor who focuses on Chinese demographics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cThe Chinese population is aging very fast, and China has a distorted sex ratio.\u201d\n\nData shows that in 1980, people 65 and older accounted for just 4.7 percent of the Chinese population. That percentage grew to 10 percent in 2015, and is projected to surge to 33 percent by 2050, according to United Nations figures.\n\nChina\u2019s average birth rate fell to a record low of 1.04 in 2015, among the lowest in the world. In contrast, the U.S. birth rate in the U.S. was 1.80 last year, according to the World Bank.\n\nBeijing fears that the aging population will have an adverse effect on the economy as the number of young workers shrinks and the government has to shoulder pension costs for the elderly.\n\n'Too little, too late'\n\nIn 2015, China finally terminated the one-child policy and started to allow people to have two children.\n\nHowever, the new policy hasn\u2019t achieved its goal. In 2017, the number of newborn babies actually fell by 3.5 percent, according to the country's statistics bureau. As many as 630,000 fewer babies were born that year, despite the loosening of restrictions.\n\nAccording to Cai, the two-child policy was \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d\n\nThe government seems to agree and has indicated that it may soon do away with family-planning policies altogether.\n\nThe National Health and Family Planning Commission, the body that oversaw population control for almost 40 years, was unceremoniously closed down this year.\n\nThen in August, the People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, published an op-ed, \u201cChildbearing is a family matter as well as a national matter.\u201d\n\nIt called on citizens to have more children and warned that \u201cthe impact of low birth rates on the economy and society has begun to show.\"\n\nThe Year of the Pig postage stamp seemed like a sign of the Chinese government's approval for three-child families when it was revealed in August. China Stringer Network / Reuters file\n\nBeijing also revealed a new postage stamp ahead of the Year of the Pig showcasing a happy family consisting of two pig parents and three piglets.\n\nThe stamp was interpreted as a nod by the government to the potential further relaxation of the two-child policy.\n\nFinancial strain\n\nHowever, the decades of restrictions have changed how many Chinese people feel about having children.\n\n\u201cThe one-child policy for the past few decades completely changed people\u2019s birth concept. From kindergarten, they think one child is very normal,\" said Yi Fuxian, a population expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"Now it\u2019s hard to restore the family value and respect for life.\"\n\nMany of the young couples and women NBC News spoke to cited the expense of education, health care and housing among the reasons for not having more than two children, even if restrictions are loosened.\n\nAnd for many, the scars from living through the one-child policy are a still a bit raw.\n\nWu Shuai, 27, said he and his wife had discussed having kids, but agreed not to for at least three years.\n\n\u201cThe cost of raising children now is so high. Medical treatment, education and children in China are taking numerous extracurricular tutoring classes,\u201d Wu said. \u201cParents bear huge burden and pressure.\u201d\n\nHe marveled at how much things had changed since his family broke the one-child policy when his younger sister was born. \u201cThe production brigade went to my home and took all valuable things from us, including the iron pot, and removed the door of our house,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also recalled how when a classmate\u2019s family had too many children, they had to move to another village to hide. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t go back home. That was 15 or 16 years ago,\u201d Wu said.\n\nHis wife, Tang Tang, 24, said she hoped to have two children \u2014 a boy and a girl. \u201cI feel that it is a responsibility, because the state\u2019s policy is beneficial for the society, and it is necessary to respond to national policies,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Zhang Haijian, a 42-year-old Russian language guide in Beijing, even one child feels like a strain. He said that he and his wife were already overwhelmed by the cost of education, health care, housing and caring for their elderly parents.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, raising one child is too much burden for us,\u201d he said.\n\nHis wife, Sun Yumin, 41, agreed.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I want two children?\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.

It's hard to imagine how the situation will evolve. What if those missiles appear in Europe? What do we do then?\"\n\nMost experts agree Russia has been violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nHowever, many of those same analysts have criticized President Donald Trump for walking away from the INF Treaty. They argue that quitting it won\u2019t bring Russia into line, and instead could trigger an arms race with ground-based nuclear missiles returning to Europe for the first time in decades.\n\nOn Thursday, Putin also said there \"have not been any negotiations\" with the U.S. to extend New START, a separate treaty that caps arsenals of intercontinental ballistic missiles and other weapons. It expires in 2021. \"Not interested? Don\u2019t need it? Fine,\" he said.\n\nAnd he warned that nuclear war could \"lead to extermination of the whole civilization.\"\n\nPutin added: \"We know how to secure our safety. But, in general, it's very bad for humanity as it takes us closer to a very dangerous line. It is a very serious question and it is a shame it is being underestimated ... We are now witnessing the collapse of the international system of nuclear containment.\"\n\nPaul Cheung / NBC News\n\nIn March, Putin boasted that Russia has a new array of nuclear-capable weapons including an intercontinental ballistic missile that renders defense systems \"useless.\" In that speech to lawmakers and elites, he also accused the West of \"ignoring us. Nobody listened to us. Well listen to us now.\"\n\nAsked whether another meeting with Trump was in the works, Putin suggested the Democrats taking the House majority next month might make \"direct dialogue with Russia\" more difficult.\n\n\"Almost with certainty, one can predict there will be new attacks on the current president,\" he said.\n\nPutin added that it was \"disrespectful\" to American voters to try to delegitimize Trump's 2016 election win.\n\nSome 1,700 journalists were accredited for the news conference that lasted more than four hours.\n\nThe Russian president appeared to back Trump's decision to pull American troops out of Syria \u2014 albeit with a sizable caveat.\n\n\"As far as the victory over ISIS, in general I agree with the U.S. president,\" Putin said. \"We have achieved considerable changes in the fight on terrorism in this territory and have executed serious blows to ISIS in Syria.\"\n\nHowever, he also questioned the need for the U.S. military to be in the region.\n\n\"Is the presence of American troops necessary? I don't think so,\" the Russian president added. \"Let's not forget that their presence there is not legitimate. It wasn't authorized by the U.N.\"\n\nHe maintained Russian troops were different because they were \"invited by the Syrian government.\"\n\nAs part of a whistle-stop tour of the world's problems, Putin was asked about France's \"yellow vest\" protesters and suggested President Emmanuel Macron's government was to blame for the crisis because they planned to hike gas prices. He said that Britain should \"execute the will of the people\" on Brexit rather than trying to wriggle out of leaving the European Union.\n\nThe Russian president was also asked about the crisis in the Black Sea last month that saw Russian ships ram, shoot and seize three Ukrainian vessels attempting to pass through the contested Kerch Strait.\n\nPutin reiterated Moscow's previous claim that the incident was concocted by Ukraine as a \"provocation\" designed to boost the popularity of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ahead of elections in March.\n\n\"Understandably, they have an election coming up. You have to aggravate the situating to raise the rating of the ... current president,\" he said. \"Was it successful? From the perspective of raising someone\u2019s rating probably, because the rating of Poroshenko seems to have risen.\"\n\nPutin was also asked what will happen to the 24 detained Ukrainian sailors, who their government claims are prisoners of war and should be released.\n\n\"There is an investigation. After the criminal case is over, we will see what happens,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian president also claimed double standards when it came to Sergei Skripal, the former spy allegedly poisoned by Russia on British soil, and Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist who was murdered inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\n\"Khashoggi was killed. It is obvious and recognized by everyone. Skripal, thank God, is alive,\" Putin said.\n\n\"However, there is a flurry of sanctions against Russia and non-stop talk about it still. In the other case, however, there is total silence. Complete silence,\" he added. \"This is the politicized, Russophobic approach. It is a reason, only just a reason for another attack on Russia.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia in response to its \"continued disregard for international norms,\" which includes Moscow's interference in 2016 U.S. election."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/new-outbreak-of-deadly-ebola-virus-disease-spreads-in-democratic-republic-of-congo-1401889347685", "text": "New outbreak of deadly Ebola virus disease spreads in Democratic Republic of Congo 02:42 copied!\n\nA new outbreak of the terrifying Ebola virus \u2013 the second-biggest outbreak the world has ever seen \u2013 is spreading through the Democratic Republic of Congo and there is little doctors can do to stop it.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nDec. 20, 2018, 9:25 AM GMT By Dan De Luce, Josh Lederman and Courtney Kube\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria will be hailed as a victory in Russia and Iran and a betrayal among Kurdish and Arab opposition forces that have waged a seven-year war against the Damascus regime, experts and former officials say.\n\nAlthough Russian and Iranian forces had already turned the tide of the civil war in favor of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the presence of U.S. troops has served as an obstacle to their ambitions and a source of leverage for Washington in any potential political settlement of the conflict.\n\nJust within the last week, senior U.S. officials had argued that the American military mission was needed to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS militants and to serve as a bulwark against Iran.\n\nBut with Trump's move to pull out the U.S. troops, Russia and particularly Iran \u2014 which sent thousands of proxies and its own elite forces into Syria \u2014 stand to emerge as the dominant players in a country that shares a border with Israel.\n\nFrom left, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu shake hands after a meeting about Syria in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday. Salvatore Di Nolfi / EPA\n\nThe withdrawal, if carried out, will \"provide Iran with solid control over the entire arc of the Levant from Baghdad to Beirut,\" said Nicholas Heras, Middle East security fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank.\n\nIran already wields significant influence next door in Iraq, where it has heavily backed Shiite militias and cultivated close ties to the Shiite-ruled government.\n\nIsrael's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the presence of Iranian forces in Syria posed a threat to his country.\n\n\"We have our concerns about Syria, about the presence of Iranian troops in Syria. And we will do whatever is necessary to protect our people regardless if you have American troops, Russian troops, or any other nations,\" Danon told reporters.\n\nThe roughly 2,000 U.S.troops in Syria, first deployed in 2015 on President Barack Obama's watch, helped Kurdish-led forces deliver a resounding defeat against Islamic State extremists that at one point held large swaths of territory. Now the Islamic State is severely damaged and is holed up in the Euphrates River valley.\n\nBut senior U.S. officials and commanders have warned that the fight against ISIS is not over and that without more help and training from American troops, the extremists could regroup and return to the fray.\n\nThe U.S. military's top officer, Gen. Joseph Dunford, said this month that training for local forces in Syria was still at an early stage, while stabilization efforts still had \"a long way to go.\"\n\nKurdish forces in Syria, which proved a reliable partner for the U.S. military's fight against ISIS, will almost certainly feel betrayed by Trump's move, experts said, and will now face a potential onslaught by Turkish forces that could jeopardize their hold on territory in the northeast.\n\n\"The U.S. withdrawal means handing over our necks to Turkey's knives,\" said a Syrian Kurd, speaking to NBC News from the town of Rmelan in northeastern Syria, near the Abu Hajar air base used for years by U.S. forces.\n\n\"My mother is crying on the phone. I feel that my heart will stop,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety.\n\nArab opposition forces fighting the Syrian regime also have relied heavily on U.S. special operations forces to help pinpoint air raids and to guide them on the battlefield. Once the American commandos leave, the Arab fighters could be vulnerable to Assad regime forces, Russian warplanes, and Iran-backed fighters as well as ISIS militants, experts and officials said.\n\nA convoy of military vehicles in the anti-ISIS coalition travels in Syria's Deir ez-Zor province on Nov. 22. Matthew Crane / US Army via Reuters file\n\nA contingent of the Arab fighters is stationed at a key base set up by U.S. troops in the southeast. The Al-Tanf base straddles a strategic route that links Baghdad with Damascus and Beirut. U.S. officers privately refer to it as a \"speed bump\" for both terrorists and Iran's proxy forces.\n\nEven by the standards of the impulsive Trump presidency, the decision came as a shock to American allies and to his Cabinet, raising fresh questions abroad about America's reliability.\n\nTrump opted to withdraw U.S. troops despite opposition from nearly every member of his national security team. In an indication of the chaotic, last-minute nature of the move, top lawmakers, administration officials and foreign allies were blindsided by the announcement. Even the U.S. special envoy for Syria, Joel Rayburn, was caught off guard, and had to cancel his attendance at a private event Wednesday morning in Syria just a few minutes in advance, said a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe withdrawal puts members of the Trump team in the uncomfortable position of breaking the promise of a continued U.S. presence in Syria that reassured U.S. allies such as Israel, the Kurds and Gulf Arab states. The president's recently named special representative for Syria engagement, Amb. James Jeffrey, had said repeatedly and publicly as recently as this week that the U.S. was not walking away from Syria and that the military would stay.\n\nIronically for Trump, who has sought to portray his foreign policy as the opposite of Obama's, the decision prompted comparisons to his predecessor. As a candidate, Trump hammered Obama for being the \"creator of ISIS\" because Obama had withdrawn U.S. troops from Iraq, a decision blamed for creating a power vacuum that allowed ISIS to take hold and then spread to Syria.\n\n\"This is Obama 2.0,\" said Mark Dubowitz, head of the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which has urged the administration to remain in Syria as a counterweight against both the Islamic State and Iran. \"It's amazing how Trump just doesn't understand how the guy he doesn't want to be like, he's being exactly like.\"\n\nLess clear is why Trump decided now to withdraw, and for what reasons.\n\nAlthough Trump had expressed impatience with the U.S. presence in Syria dating back to his time as a candidate, his aides and foreign leaders had convinced him to stay. After Trump earlier this year mused about pulling out during midterm campaign rallies, senior military leaders joined foreign countries including Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a full-court press to him to hold off, officials and others briefed on the conversations said.\n\nBut Trump had long been pushed to pull out by Turkey, a NATO ally at odds with the U.S. in Syria over American backing for Kurdish forces that the Turks consider terrorists. Turkey's influence with the U.S. has increased in recent weeks following the release by Turkey of American pastor Andrew Brunson and by the murder in Istanbul of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate by a hit team sent by Saudi Arabia's government.\n\nTrump's hopes of maintaining close U.S. ties to Saudi Arabia and its young leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave additional leverage to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government adeptly demonstrated that it had damning intelligence about the killing that could be either leaked or kept quiet.\n\nA turning point for Trump appears to be his phone call Friday with Erdogan, which a U.S. official said had made clear that Trump was never truly committed to staying in Syria. Another senior administration official who briefed reporters Wednesday said that Trump had merely informed Erdogan in the call of a decision he'd already made.\n\nAlthough it's unclear what else Trump and Erdogan may have agreed to during the call, a number of thorny issues between Turkey and the U.S. appear to be heading toward resolution at the same time.\n\nErdogan had been threatening an imminent new military operation into Syria, where Turkish attacks against Kurds could have risked a potentially deadly confrontation with U.S. troops who are working in close quarters with the Kurdish fighters. Trump's decision to withdraw averts that risk.\n\nWashington has also been at odds with Turkey over its planned purchase of the S-400 missile defense system from Russia, which would trigger U.S. sanctions on Turkey and pose major problems for NATO. Late Friday, the State Department announced plans to approve a sale of U.S.-made Patriot missiles \u2014 an alternative to the S-400 \u2014 to Turkey's government.\n\nIt's unclear whether Turkey will agree to drop its S-400 sale and purchase only the American-made Patriot missiles instead. Nor is it clear whether the timing of the approval, just before Trump's Syria decision, was coincidental.\n\nTwo congressional aides said that the proposal to sell the missiles to the Turks had been awaiting informal sign-off from top lawmakers overseeing foreign affairs for some time. They said that the last remaining holdout, Sen. Bob Menendez, D.-N.J., had finally given his permission for the sale on Tuesday following efforts to persuade him by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/9-11-hangs-over-taliban-talks-assurances-militant-group-has-n946011", "text": "Despite years of fighting, only around 65 percent of the Afghan population lives in areas under government control.\n\nReflecting the sense they have the upper hand on the battlefield, or at very least reached a stalemate, the Taliban is keen to show it is no longer beholden to international terror groups. It is also trying to portray itself as ready to re-enter the official halls of power.\n\nSo the militant group is counting on war weariness outweighing U.S. fears of the 20 or so \u201ctransregional\u201d terrorist groups thought to be operating in and around Afghanistan.\n\nA senior Afghan Taliban commander who is also a member of the group\u2019s leadership council told NBC News that there were around 2,000 to 3,000 non-Afghan fighters in their midst, mostly from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, Tunisia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.\n\n\"We are Muslims and according to our religion ... we cannot deny shelter to someone if he or she comes to trouble,\" said the commander, who recently attended three days of talks with Khalilzad in Qatar. \u201cNone of the foreign militants would be allowed to take up arms and use this soil against any country in the world.\u201d\n\nThousands of Pakistanis are also thought to be fighting as members of the Taliban.\n\nBin Laden also attracted foreign fighters to Afghanistan after relocating there when the country was ruled by the Taliban, so the question of how the group would deal with the issue still resonates in Washington.\n\nOsama bin Laden took refuge in Afghanistan before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. AFP file\n\nAhmed Rashid, who is considered one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on the Taliban and Afghanistan, estimated that between 2,000 and 3,000 Arabs under bin Laden fought with the Taliban before 9/11, as did tens of thousands of Pakistani militants and a smaller number of Uzbek radicals. The number of foreign fighters in Afghanistan the 1980s stood at around 35,000, according to Rashid.\n\nDespite 17 years of U.S. counter-terrorism fighting in Afghanistan, a greatly weakened Al Qaeda still operates in pockets of the country. In August, Afghan defense officials said its militants had been part of a Taliban's assault in the east of the country. And in November, an American soldier was killed in battle with Al Qaeda militants in the southwest.\n\n\u201cEven after 9/11, the Taliban was not willing to give up Al Qaeda,\u201d said Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on international terrorism and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cAlthough since the mid-2000s, the Taliban was periodically telling the U.S. that they would not support Al Qaeda, they have never been willing to say it publicly on the record.\u201d\n\nIt would be politically costly to \u201cjust disavow their brethren,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is partly because after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the country became a magnet for cash and a training ground for thousands of jihadis. Bin Laden raised funds to help expel \u201cinfidel\u201d Russian troops in a cause that galvanized a generation of mujahedeen, or holy warriors, and still reverberates throughout the Muslim world.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the Taliban loves Al Qaeda,\u201d Felbab-Brown said. \u201cBut it does not necessarily mean that they can easily control them.\u201d\n\nMujahedeen sit on a captured Soviet tank in Afghanistan in 1987. AP file\n\nEven if they wanted to, it is unlikely that the Taliban could keep a promise to rein in foreign fighters and groups. For one thing, the central government in Kabul has always struggled to control the country.\n\nAnd then there is ISIS Khorasan, the Islamic State\u2019s local affiliate which includes many disaffected Taliban fighters. While small in number, the group has been especially brazen and lethal.\n\nOther groups with regional ambitions, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed \u2014 both of which fight for Indian-controlled Kashmir to separate and become part of Pakistan \u2014 have operated \u201cindependently, or even in contradiction to the Taliban,\u201d Felbab-Brown added.\n\nThe Taliban counters that in the 17 years that it has been fighting U.S. and Afghan forces, not a single attack outside the country has emanated from Afghanistan.\n\nToday's Taliban is much more self-reliant, according to Seth Jones, a former special operations officer in Afghanistan and the director of the transnational threats program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\nWhen giving shelter to bin Laden before 9/11, the Taliban could count on an influx of financial help and fighters from abroad \u2014 particularly from conservative Sunni Gulf kingdoms.\n\nBut the group has diversified its income and is involved in everything from poppies \u2014 the source of opium \u2014 to the timber business, Jones said.\n\n\u201cTaliban commanders at the local level are quite innovative in finding sources of income [and] taxation on areas,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no worries that the Taliban can find sources of money.\u201d\n\nOf special concern is continued support for the Taliban from neighbor Pakistan, which has long provided support for the group. Frustration with this prompted Trump to cancel $300 million in aid to Pakistan in September.\n\nPakistani officials reject claims they help or shelter Afghan militants.\n\nExperts also say it appears doubtful the Taliban would ever be able to fully control the country. This leaves open the possibility that groups such as ISIS, which the Taliban has been battling, will set up strongholds and terrorists intent on attacking targets beyond Afghanistan's borders.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that the lure and the magnetism of the Iraq and Syria wars has subsided,\u201d Jones said, referring to the recapture of most of the land in the Middle East once controlled by ISIS.\n\nAnd as the origin of \u201cglobal jihad,\u201d Afghanistan remains \u201ca winning cause,\u201d he added."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/jack-ma-card-carrying-communist-what-makes-him-tick-n943981", "text": "Many had assumed he was a party member all along.

That changed 150 years ago on Monday when the world\u2019s first traffic light was installed in London. Towering 20 feet above the street, the gas-powered signal was placed at the busy intersection outside the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThe world's first traffic light was put up on Dec. 10, 1868. The British Newspaper Archive\n\nWith more than 1,000 people dying each year on London's horse-and-buggy-clogged roads at the time, city leaders knew they had to do something, according to the Transport for London transit authority. Invented by railway engineer J.P. Knight, the traffic light did just that.\n\nGiven its inventor's occupation, it's not surprising that it resembled a railway signal and was equipped with both waving arms and gas-powered green and red lights for use at night. A police officer changed the lights manually, using switches.\n\nDespite the British capital's attempt to improve safety, the introduction of this new technology wasn\u2019t without controversy.\n\n\u201cThe direct control of our movement \u2014 stop now, go now \u2014 sat uneasily in Victorian liberal society,\u201d said David Rooney, a researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London, and the author of a book on this history of traffic congestion.\n\nAt the time, London arguably needed more traffic control than ever. Its population had exploded from around 3 million in 1861 to around 7 million by 1910.\n\nHowever, the reign of the world\u2019s first traffic light was extraordinarily short-lived. A gas leak caused a series of explosions, seriously injuring a policeman, after just a month in action.\n\nThe city had to wait nearly six decades for traffic lights to really take off in 1925, when signals with electric lights came to London from the U.S.\n\nToday, there are nearly 9 million people living in the greater London area. It\u2019s the world\u2019s seventh most congested city, behind Los Angeles at No. 1 and New York at 3, according to transport analytics company Inrix\u2019s global traffic scorecard.\n\nBuses pass through traffic lights near the Houses of Parliament in London. Birute / Getty Images file\n\nParliament Square is now one of the capital\u2019s busiest areas. Tourists, civil servants and politicians cram the sidewalks, while cars and trucks stream over the bridge to South London.\n\nAt the intersection where the first traffic light stood, there are now 24 individual lights directing cars and pedestrians, overlooked by a statue of Winston Churchill.\n\nThey are among the more than 6,000 lights that control traffic in London, and while they control traffic, they've done little to stem its flow.\n\n\u201cDriving around here is murder,\" Clive Pearce, a black-cab driver, said as he dropped off passengers outside Westminster Abbey. \"I started driving 42 years ago and traffic is now the worst I\u2019ve seen.

She immediately pledged to honor the referendum result and get Britain out of the 28-country bloc.\n\nHowever, that is now up in the air as her negotiated withdrawal agreement with the E.U. drew so little support from her own party that she was forced to pull a vote at the last minute on Monday and go back to Europe to beg for further concessions.\n\nBoth Cameron and May supported remaining in the E.U. during the referendum campaign.\n\nWith a little more than three months left before Britain officially leaves the E.U. on March 29, Cameron has been busy tweeting tributes to politicians who have passed away and highlighting the work of dementia researchers.\n\nFive years after UK launched @WorldDementia Council at the G8, we've made huge strides.

But in the party\u2019s election manifesto, there was a catch.\n\nHis party had been divided for decades about whether the U.K. should be a member of the E.U.\n\nTo help heal this rift, the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto set out a plan to let the people have their say on Britain\u2019s relationship with the E.U.

Those numbers don't include Britons who applied to become citizens in Germany.\n\nIn total, the number of Brits who became Germany citizens jumped to 7,439 in 2017, from 622 in 2015.\n\nGermany isn\u2019t the only country dealing with an influx of applications from Britons seeking or claiming citizenship.\n\nImmigration was a hot topic in the 2016 referendum, with many politicians claiming it was the reason a majority voted to leave.

(Those born in Northern Ireland are already entitled to an Irish passport.)\n\nLast year more than 80,000 people applied from Britain, an increase of more than 27 percent from 2016 and nearly 75 percent from 2015, the year before the referendum.\n\nMeanwhile, the French Embassy in London has seen a 220 percent increase in applications this year, after a 131 percent increase in 2017.\n\nIn Belgium, 1,381 people with British citizenship became citizens in 2017, compared with 127 in 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s not only Britons who are seeking to cement their status in their country of residence.

A 2009 report on the future of the practice says that there are 3,000 reindeer herders in Sweden alone, and a total of nearly 100,000 globally.\n\nIt's a family business. Inga said he took the lead from his father when he turned 18 and works alongside 17 other full-time herders in the community that includes his cousins and nephew.\n\nEvery September, reindeer are gathered and killed for meat. It\u2019s the main source of income for the herders.\n\nA Sami man labels a reindeer calf near the village of Dikanaess, Sweden, in 2016. Jonathan Nackstrand / AFP/Getty Images file\n\nAfter the slaughter, the remaining reindeer are left to graze in the wild until it\u2019s time for the winter migration eastward to better grazing territory. For Inga, that's a trek of more than 62 miles.\n\nHerders follow the animals on snowmobile, spending nights in cabins along the route. Children get the time off school to take part in the process.\n\n\u201cEverything is connected to the reindeer and the reindeer herding,\u201d Inga said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you\u2019re born and raised in.\u201d\n\nBut Inga, who is also the chairman of the Swedish Sami Association, believes \"something is shifting.\"\n\nThe snow is vital to every aspect of reindeer husbandry so this winter's erratic freeze-thaw cycle is a problem.\n\nResearch suggests the effects of global warming are amplified at the poles, with average air temperatures rising faster than elsewhere on the planet. This results in the rapid loss of ice, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado. This year's winter freeze is being forecast to come late for the Scandanavian region and ice formation will be below-average.\n\nThe herders need the snow for their own travels through the wild terrain. Snow also makes it easier for the Sami to track reindeer and predators.\n\nMost importantly, the snow impacts vegetation. A delayed winter could be viewed as a good thing, allowing the reindeer more time to graze by the mountains, Inga said. But it could also lead to the reindeer trampling the plants and prompt overgrazing.\n\nResearch is backing up the changes the Sami are witnessing. Gunhild Rosqvist, a geography professor at Stockholm University, is part of a team studying the changing Arctic landscape, including the accelerating loss of glacier ice in the Scandinavian mountains.\n\nRosqvist is currently working with the herders to study how weather variability is impacting the animals.\n\nIt's becoming clear the animals are migrating into new areas \u2014 despite roads and other development blocking their path \u2014 which in turn is forcing herders to change their practices, she said.\n\nThe expansion of mining, wind-energy farms and tourism across northern Sweden is cutting back on the available land.\n\nThe entire town of Kiruna is being forced to move because of the neighboring iron ore mine.\n\n\u201cThe combined pressure of all this and climate change is really pushing some of these communities over the tipping point,\u201d Rosqvist said.\n\nA Sami man catches a reindeer near the village of Dikanaess, Sweden. Jonathan Nackstrand / AFP/Getty Images file\n\nReindeer migration is just one of the many symptoms of the warming climate.\n\nThis summer saw Sweden\u2019s highest peak lose that status due to glacial melt while wildfires spanned an unprecedented 61,775 acres across the country amid record hot and dry conditions.\n\nA huge section of a glacier near Rosqvist's northern research station unexpectedly broke loose in an ice avalanche, she said, shocking scientists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency,\u201d Rosqvist added. \u201cThe whole ecosystem is so delicate.\u201d\n\nDespite the rapid changes to the landscape, the Sami are trying to adapt. Inga said herders are discussing what to do if the land fails to provide enough food for the reindeer.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to feed them because it isn\u2019t natural and it\u2019s part of our culture,\u201d Inga said. The reindeer are semi-domesticated and bringing in food could change their behavior dramatically, he said. It could also affect the quality of the meat.\n\nSanna Vannar, president of the Sami youth association S\u00e1minuorra, said members hope that they\u2019ll be able to continue the traditions of their forefathers.\n\nThe association joined 10 families across Europe and Africa to lodge a lawsuit against the European Union in May for failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.\n\nThe lawsuit specifically cites the challenges reindeer are having in finding food due to the warming climate and the repercussions it, in turn, has on Sami culture and livelihoods.\n\n\"It's really bad for young reindeer herders because they every day have to think about the weather,\" Vannar said. \"I can't see my life without reindeer.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/dead-sea-dying-1-5-billion-plan-aims-resurrect-it-n926066", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The once 10-minute walk to the water\u2019s edge now takes an hour trekking over cracked, salt-encrusted soil.\n\nThe Dead Sea is dying rapidly. The biblical body of water lying between Israel and Jordan is retreating by more than three feet a year, creating sinkholes that swallow up buildings and roads, and forcing the rich seaside landscape on which the tourism industry relies to fade into memory.\n\nIt is the saltiest sea on earth. Some experts believe it will be gone by 2050, while others say it will never fully disappear but survive at a fraction of its current size.\n\nBut after two decades of discussions about how to resurrect the Dead Sea, there is a glimmer of hope but with a huge price tag: a $1.5-billion project to build a desalination facility in Jordan to transform Red Sea water into drinking water, while pumping the remaining salty brine into the Dead Sea.\n\nMeetings to finalize the technical details and its design are expected within weeks \u2014 a major step forward for the project.\n\nThere are references to the Dead Sea in the Old Testament and the Quran, making it significant to Christians, Jews and Muslims. One of the oldest known manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, were found in the region, and a section of the Jordan River about six miles north of where it flows is also considered the baptism site of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe sea is not disappearing without vengeance, though, as roughly 6,000 sinkholes have formed.\n\n\u201cEven the devil is not here,\u201d said water management and environmental engineer Eshak Alguza, as the parched earth that was once underwater crunches and shatters like breaking tiles beneath his feet.\n\nThe heavy price of sinkholes has become apparent both in Jordan and on the sea's Israeli side.\n\nAt least two of the Israel's beaches and one tourist resort have closed, while parts of Highway 90 have vanished into the earth.\n\nResidents in the community of Ein Gedi have turned into activists, demanding assistance as they watch the land crumble around them. \u201cThey feel that their government has abandoned them,\u201d said Clive Lipchin, director of the Transboundary Water Management Center at the Arava Institute in Israel.\n\nThere are a multitude of reasons contributing to the decline of the Dead Sea, ranging from damming to mineral extraction. The region\u2019s combative politics are stirred into all of them.\n\n\"This is a man-made catastrophe,\" said Alguza, who is a project manager with EcoPeace Middle East, a nongovernmental organization that works with Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian officials.\n\nEcoPeace engineer Eshak Alguza breaks off a chunk of salt on what used to be the bottom of the Dead Sea. Ziad Jaber / NBC News\n\nThe sea is fed by the Jordan River and other smaller waterways. Ali Subah, general secretary of Jordan\u2019s water and irrigation ministry, said the flow of the Jordan River has dropped by more than 90 percent from its recorded peak.\n\nThe river has been diverted by Israel upstream, while Syria built dams along the Yarmouk River, substantially cutting off the flow that converges with the Jordan.\n\nData from Jordan\u2019s water ministry shows that rainfall in eight of the 10 years from 2004 to 2014 was below average in volume, depriving rivers and aquifers that rely on it.\n\nGroundwater is among the sources being depleted in an attempt to meet demands. Marwan Al-Raggad, a hydrogeology professor at the University of Jordan, said the Disi aquifer, which is about 1,093 yards underground and feeds the Dead Sea, could run dry in as few as 50 years.\n\nIn addition to sources being cut off, seawater is evaporating naturally and quickly. Climate change is expected to cause temperatures in the area to rise 5 to 11 degrees by the end of the century and reduce rainfall by 30 percent.\n\nMineral extraction is a big industry in the region, and it is also taking a toll. Companies on both sides of the border are pumping an estimated 61.3 billion gallons a year of the seawater, although some critics allege that number is substantially higher. The water is placed in pools so it can evaporate, leaving behind valuable potash, bromine and other substances.\n\nThe retreating sea has left behind infertile saline land that, when dissolved by freshwater, becomes unstable and collapses into craters.\n\nJordanian farmer Sameer Mahadin tends to his chili crop. His family's farm once sat on the southern shores of the Dead Sea, but the water had now evaporated. Ziad Jaber / NBC News\n\nMahadin, 55, said the air is less humid than it was decades ago, forcing him to buy water to irrigate his crops. About one-quarter of the farms in the area have been sold or gone out of business, he said.\n\nA pipe dream\n\nThe Red Sea-Dead Sea conveyance project would seemingly resolve multiple issues: filling the gap of the region\u2019s freshwater scarcity, stabilizing levels of the Dead Sea and setting a high bar for peace and collaboration between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians.\n\nSuch cooperation is needed at a time when Jordan and Israel are entering renegotiations over a deal to share land and water that was part of a 1994 peace treaty.\n\nWhile politics have been blamed for dragging out discussions over two decades, there have also been many technical complications. Among them is that foreign water could change the chemistry of the Dead Sea. Studies estimate that up to 105 billion gallonsof water could be pumped in safely into the sea annually, but any more than that would risk the formation of algae or gypsum, which would turn the water a milky white or lead to the formation crystals on the surface.\n\nNabil Zoubi, the project director, said Israel and Jordan will pick up one-third of the bill through support of a grant from the U.S. government and loans from the French development fund, European Commission, and the Italian and Spanish governments.\n\nThe remaining two-thirds would be footed by the private sector.\n\nAfter many delays, Zoubi said the project is nearly ready tobe opened to bidders, but a few technical aspects still need to be ironed out.\n\nThe best-case scenario would see construction begin in early 2021 and take around three-and-a-half years to complete.\n\nThe southern end of the Dead Sea in Jordan. Ziad Jaber / NBC News\n\nThe first phase of the project would produce 62 billion gallons of brine, while after the second phase, another 30.4 billion gallons of brine will be pumped into the Dead Sea. But experts say 10 times that amount is needed to stabilize the sea, meaning the Red-Dead would simply be a drop in the bucket.\n\nThe Arava Institute\u2019s Lipchin said a Plan B is required for the agricultural, tourism and other sectors that will inevitably suffer. He argues that political wrangling and excitement about the Red-Dead project are wasting precious time.\n\nFathi Al Haweimel, an elected government official for the area south of the sea in Jordan, said the area's religious, political and historical significance leaves little time to waste.\n\n\"Saving the Dead Sea is the responsibility of the entire world,\" he said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/inside-the-humanitarian-mission-to-help-to-venezuelan-refugees-part-1-1386662979945", "text": "Inside the humanitarian mission to help Venezuelan refugees (Part 1) 03:38 copied!\n\nIt\u2019s the largest refugee flight in the hemisphere, though you may not have heard of it.

Ukraine says the incident occurred in international waters.\n\nUkraine insists Moscow is again blockading the sea, something Moscow denies. Russia says it merely needs to inspect all ships passing through as a security measure to protect a $3.6 billion bridge it's built across the Kerch Strait from its mainland to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Ukraine has invoked the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, which was signed in 1994 by Ukraine, Russia, the U.S. and U.K.\n\n\"Ukraine gave up the third-largest nuclear arsenal\" in the world, Ukrainian lawyer and human rights activist Stanislav Batryn told UkrLifeTV this week. \"Today Russia violated the territorial integrity of Ukraine and is in fact starting a Third World War.\"\n\nAfter declaring independence in 1991, Ukraine found itself with thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons that were still controlled by Russian systems.\n\nThe U.S. was extremely worried about the potential emergence of another nuclear power with ICBMs designed to target the U.S. and its allies. So Washington brokered the agreement and paid half a billion dollars for Ukraine to pass these weapons to Russia to be dismantled.\n\nIn return, Russia, the U.S. and the U.K. agreed to \"refrain from the threat or use of force\" against Ukraine and to respect its \"independence and sovereignty and the existing borders.\" Belarus and Kazakhstan also gave up their smaller stockpiles in exchange for the same promises.\n\nWhen Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, it was widely accepted that this agreement had been violated.

People in D.C. tell me when people are going away, when people may be coming in, and my job is to keep these folks comfortable, safe.\"\n\nBut without $69 million from Congress, even current operations are in jeopardy. One camp is quickly falling into disrepair and the others are not equipped for a population that is now entering its 70s.\n\nWalking through the corridors of Camp 6, Ring pointed out doors not wide enough to fit wheelchairs and described areas in other camps where the floor is so tilted that guards have had to chisel cement to close the doors.\n\nRing, who arrived here in April, is the commander in charge of the 16-years-and-running mission known as Joint Task Force Guantanamo.\n\nThe Obama administration's stated goal was to close Guantanamo Bay Prison, or Gitmo.

Detainees who arrived as young men are growing old. Their average age is 46, and one is now 71.\n\nThe controversial interrogation techniques that were once synonymous with Gitmo would provide no battlefield intelligence today, Ring said, because the last detainee was transferred here in 2008.\n\nInstead he worries about what it would take to build something resembling a nursing home at Guantanamo, and the classified Camp 7 that is falling into disrepair.\n\n\"It's sort of falling into the ground and deteriorating rapidly,\" he said.

Stephen Xenakis, a psychiatrist who has done work with detainees in Gitmo, said the delays in care for Hadi and others stem from the necessity of having to fly in specialists, the lack of trust that sometimes exists between the detainee patients and doctors, and medical facilities that need to be updated to detect problems, particularly in an aging population.\n\nInside a detainee's cell at Guantanamo.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nNov. 28, 2018, 9:24 AM GMT By Dan De Luce, Mushtaq Yusufzai, Courtney Kube and Josh Lederman\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's envoy to Afghanistan is reaching out to many top Taliban figures as he tries to launch peace negotiations to end the war before Trump can simply pull the plug and order U.S. troops home, say foreign diplomats.\n\nU.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has moved at a rapid pace and ventured beyond the official Taliban office in Qatar to meet other members of the insurgency, two foreign diplomats and three former U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\nHis outreach included a meeting in the United Arab Emirates with a militant claiming to be an associate of Mullah Yaqub, son of late Taliban leader Mullah Omar and now one of two deputies to the current Taliban leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, two foreign diplomats said.\n\nKhalilzad is \"testing all channels,\" said one Western diplomat, who was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nAlthough it remained unclear if the Taliban member was indeed a representative sent by Yaqub, the meeting reflected how Khalilzad is moving with a sense of urgency and casting a wide net to try to persuade different elements of the insurgency to come to the table to talk peace, former officials said.\n\nKeenly aware that President Trump has expressed impatience with the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan and that time is limited, Khalilzad, who was born in Afghanistan and served as U.S. ambassador to the country after the 9/11 attacks, has pressed ahead with his diplomacy at a swift tempo, former officials and foreign diplomats said.\n\nU.S. officials are operating under the assumption that the president will pull the plug on the current American military mission in Afghanistan well before the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, current and former U.S. officials said.\n\n\"Both the Defense Department and State Department are acting as if withdrawal is on the table, sooner or later,\" said Thomas Jocselyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\nThe Trump administration has also sought to force the Taliban to the negotiating table with a massive bombing campaign. This year the number of U.S. bombs dropped on Afghanistan has hit a record high, with more than 5,200 as of September 30.\n\nThe State Department declined to divulge details of who Khalilzad met during his travels or what was discussed, but said he will continue to meet \"with all interested parties.\"\n\n\"We are not going to provide a read-out of every meeting as Special Representative Khalilzad determines how best to promote a negotiated settlement between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban,\" said a State Department spokesperson, Heidi Hattenbach.\n\nShe also said the U.S. envoy has stayed in close communication with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and other Afghan political leaders. In his last trip, his first and last stops were in Kabul, \"to ensure President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah were kept informed of all his upcoming meetings and the subsequent findings from those meetings.\"\n\nThe recent flurry of U.S. diplomacy \u2014 and Trump's clear ambivalence about keeping troops in the country \u2014 has created friction with Ghani and his allies. Afghan officials in Kabul fear Washington's direct talks with the Taliban could leave them sidelined and that a short timeline could backfire badly.\n\n\"Peace talks also must not be driven by superficial deadlines urged by a U.S. administration anxious to be done with the conflict,\" Nader Nadery, a former senior adviser to President Ghani, wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post Monday.\n\nThe recent meeting with a representative of the son of the Taliban's former leader, if confirmed, would be \"a potentially positive development\" given Yaqub's senior rank and his reputation for favoring a political settlement, said Johnny Walsh, a former lead adviser on Afghan peace efforts at the State Department.\n\nU.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, talks with local reporters at the U.S. embassy in Kabul on Nov. 18, 2018. U.S Embassy / Reuters\n\n\"It's worth exploring more of those proposective channels than perhaps we collectively have in the past, because some of them will lead somewhere,\" Walsh said.\n\nYaqub's father, Mullah Omar, was the reclusive founder of the hardline Islamist Taliban that ruled the country from 1996-2001 and forged an alliance with Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda. His regime was ousted from power by U.S.-led forces in 2001 for having offered safe haven to Al-Qaeda militants who staged the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.\n\nIn three days of talks in Qatar earlier this month, Khalilzad met with eight Taliban representatives, including two militants formerly held in Guantanamo, Khairullah Khairkhwa, the former Taliban governor of Herat, and Mohammed Fazl, a former Taliban military chief, Taliban sources told NBC News. Their participation signaled the Taliban's serious interest in holding talks and Fazl in particular is seen as boosting the authority of the Taliban negotiating contingent in Qatar, analysts said.\n\nIn his recent visit to Kabul, Khalilzad told reporters that \"I remain cautiously optimistic or hopeful given the complexities that exist.\"\n\nThe U.S. envoy also said that the \"Taliban are saying that they do not believe that they can succeed militarily.\"\n\nBut an insurgency source rejected Khalilzad's comments, saying his account was overly positive and that the group had not given up on its military prospects.\n\n\"We only mentioned that we believe that fighting is not the solution to any problem,\" a senior Taliban leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told NBC News.\n\nKhalilzad has asked President Ghani and the Taliban to form negotiating teams, stressing that the delegations need to be broadly representative to ensure a successful settlement, foreign diplomats and former officials said. By moving ahead with a series of direct discussions with the Taliban, Khalilzad is effectively putting pressure on Ghani to form a negotiating team without delay, said former U.S. officials familiar with the talks.\n\nAfghan electoral authorities, meanwhile, have raised the possibility of postponing the presidential election scheduled for April next year due to ballot counting problems in last month's parliamentary polls.\n\nIn his Kabul meetings, Khalilzad has explored the idea of pushing back the election and its potential benefit to peace talks, an Afghan government official and a former U.S. official said.Under this scenario, an interim government could include a Taliban representative and this possibly could open the way for the Taliban to enter into full-fledged peace negotiations, as it has long maintained that the existing Afghan government and constitution are illegitimate.\n\nTaliban leader Mullah Omar died in 2013. National Counterterrorism Center / Reuters\n\nKhalilzad told reporters in Kabul that it was up to Afghans to decide whether to postpone the elections but he added that it would be ideal to arrive at a peace agreement before the April vote.\n\nCritics have warned that forming an effective interim government could prove impossible given the current Afghan government's deep divisions and frequent dysfunction.\n\nThe Afghan official said that Ghani's government is skeptical that the Taliban can deliver on any promises and that Pakistan and other countries that lend support to the insurgents hold the key to any peace deal.\n\n\"The Afghan government doesn't think that the Taliban is independent enough to stop the war even if they were to agree to do so in negotiations,\" the official said. \"The only way fighting will stop is if the Pakistanis and other international supporters of the Taliban are involved in the negotiations.\"\n\nPakistan \u2014 the longtime patron of the Taliban \u2014 last month released Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the insurgency, to allow him to take part in any political talks. The move was seen as a welcome initial step by U.S. officials, but it remained unclear if Islamabad was prepared to throw its full weight behind the talks.\n\nStill, former officials said the current peace effort showed more promise than a previous U.S. attempt under President Barack Obama, which was plagued by turf battles inside the administration and ambivalence among military commanders, who favored hammering the Taliban on the battlefield before entering into any serious talks.\n\n\"It was seen as a sort of side project that the State Department was running,\" said Jason Campbell, a former senior official at the Defense Department who worked on Afghanistan policy.\n\nThe whole project collapsed in 2013, with then Afghan President Hamid Karzai feeling betrayed by Washington's outreach to the Taliban.\n\nThe current talks with the Taliban have been accompanied by a spike in violence in Afghanistan, amid signs that the Taliban have gained strength on the battlefield in recent months. A suicide bombing last week in Kabul claimed more than 50 lives and three U.S. service members were killed Tuesday by a roadside bomb near Ghazni city.\n\nSher Mohammad Abbas Stanakzai, head of the Taliban's political council in Qatar, and an unidentified representative of the Afghan Taliban movement speak prior to the start of the Second Moscow round of Afghanistan peace settlement talks in Moscow on Nov. 9, 2018.

A total of two dozen sailors were detained at a nearby port.\n\nThe Ukrainian vessels were attempting to pass through the Kerch Strait, a narrow artery linking the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Russia has effectively controlled the strait ever since it annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\nIn response, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko declared 30 days of martial law in border areas over what he called a violation of international law. Russia blamed the incident on Ukrainian provocation.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joined other Western leaders in pointing the finger squarely at the Kremlin and alleged Russia aggression. Their boss \u2014 often accused of being soft on President Vladimir Putin \u2014 appeared reluctant to apportion blame.\n\n\"We don't like what's happening either way,\" President Donald Trump told reporters Monday.\n\nWhere are the Ukrainian sailors?\n\nThe sailors were taken to the Crimean port of Kerch, where local media released a video purporting to show some of the men speaking on camera. They explain they entered Russian territorial waters and received warnings from Russian border control vessels to leave the area.\n\nOne of the men said he was aware their actions were \"of a provocative nature.\"\n\nA serviceman guards a military vessel moored in the Sea of Azov port of Mairupol, Ukraine, on Tuesday. Sega Volskii / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThe Ukrainian military confirmed on Facebook that the men in the video were its sailors.\n\nHowever, such videos must be treated with extreme caution because it's not clear what was said before or after these edited extracts, nor whether the sailors were under duress.\n\nThe men appear relaxed, but the head of Ukraine's security service, Vasyl Hrytsak warned that they were under \"psychological and physical pressure\" while in detention.\n\nBoth countries disagree on the detainees' legal status.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin called them \"prisoners of war.\" This means they would be protected by the Geneva Convention, which states POWs should be treated humanely, shielded from \"public curiosity\" and immune from prosecution for taking part in hostilities.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross in Ukraine told NBC News it had asked for access to the detainees.\n\n\"What's most important now is that those wounded and detained in relation to this situation are treated humanely, that the wounded get an adequate medical care and that the detained crews' members can communicate with their loved ones,\" ICRC spokeswoman Jana Bauerova said.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, denies the men are POWs. It calls them trespassers who will be \"prosecuted in strict accordance with the law,\" the state-run TASS news agency quoted Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying.\n\nA local court will determine the fate of the sailors but Ukraine's foreign minister suggested the decision would ultimately be in the hands of the Russian president.\n\n\"In reality, we clearly understand that the decision can only be made on Putin's level,\" Klimkin told Ukrainian television. \"That\u2019s where our efforts are at.\"\n\nWhat does international law say?\n\nCutting through the claims and counterclaims, the dispute largely boils down to one thing: Crimea.\n\nWhen Russia and Ukraine were relatively friendly, they shared the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait as part of a 2003 agreement.\n\nThat was all fine until 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. This gave it control of not just one but both sides of the strait.\n\nAlthough the 2003 agreement still stands in theory, Russia now demands that all vessels, including those from Ukraine, to request permission before they pass through.\n\nIn May, it opened the $3.69 billion Crimea Bridge, cementing its grip on this crucial bottleneck. Independent observers have pointed out that the bridge's span is lower than international standards, putting a permanent cap on the size of ship able to enter the Azov.\n\nThe move has caused huge delays in recent months, leading to claims Russia is trying to blockade Ukraine's ports and transform the Azov into a de facto Russian lake.\n\nSome Western critics say this is all part of the Kremlin's tactic of \"creeping annexation,\" a ploy to subtly recoup territory from its old Soviet allies.\n\nRussia has been adamant its actions in the area are legally justified, and points out Ukraine has detained one of its own ships in this region.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that Russia claimed the three Ukrainian ships had entered its waters Sunday, ignoring verbal cautions and even warning shots.\n\nCoordinates offered by officials and analysts on both sides suggest the vessels had been in Crimean waters, which Russia regards as its \"territorial sea.\"\n\nAccess to the Ukrainian port of Berdyansk, on the Sea of Azov, has been restricted by Russia's control of the Kerch Strait. Evgeniy Maloletka / AP\n\nThe problem with this is that most countries in the world, including the U.S. and almost all of Europe, say Russia's annexation of Crimea is an illegal occupation. They don't recognize these waters as Russian, and therefore say Moscow has no grounds to stop ships, let alone fire at them.\n\nOn this fundamental principle alone Russia's actions Sunday broke international law, according to Valentin Schatz, research associate in public international law at Germany's University of Hamburg.\n\nHe said that on a practical level, it could be argued Ukrainian ships have an obligation to notify Russian authorities and cooperate as they pass through the strait. Ukraine says it did this; Russia says that's not true.\n\nIn any case, Ukraine insists that its ships fled back out into international waters when they were shot at and seized.\n\nUkraine publishes maps showing where it claims its three ships were fired at and seized \u2014 says it was just inside international waters:https://t.co/HwILLvnQXE pic.twitter.com/Nb8eXIqDuc \u2014 Alexander Smith (@AlexanderSmith) November 28, 2018\n\nEven if one were to accept that Crimea is now part of Russia, the Kremlin's legal case for firing at Ukrainian ships is shaky, Schatz added. Using force and detaining foreign warships \"may only be used in exceptional circumstances,\" he said.\n\nWhile international law is firmly on Ukraine's side, the local reality is different, according to Bal\u00e1zs Jar\u00e1bik, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"For Russia the security of the Kerch bridge is the utmost priority, and that requires Russia to minimize the Ukrainian military naval presence,\" he said.\n\nWhat might happen next?\n\nMoscow is already embroiled in a conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting a war against Kiev's troops, a four-year conflict that's claimed more than 10,000 lives.\n\nRocked by an ailing economy and burdened by Western sanctions, Putin has no desire to open up another front in the conflict, according to the Centre for Eastern Studies, a Warsaw-based think tank.\n\nInstead, the use of force against Ukraine is more likely an attempt to \"expose the helplessness of the Ukrainian side\" and tighten Russia's newfound grip on the Sea of Azov, four experts based at the Centre for Eastern Studies wrote Monday.\n\nWestern leaders have expressed \"deep concern\" at the events, but it's unclear whether this will translate into concrete action. Ukraine has called on the U.S. and Europe to levy more sanctions on Moscow.\n\nAnother option open to them is to provide Ukraine with assistance such as radars and anti-ship missiles, according to Michael Carpenter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense at the Pentagon.\n\nThe U.S. currently has around 200 soldiers stationed as advisers in Ukraine but they are in the west of the country, hundreds of miles from Crimea and fighting in the east.\n\nThe crisis has had political implications too. On Monday, Poroshenko gained parliamentary approval to impose martial law in some of the country. Many experts had feared he would use this to postpone March's presidential election as he trails badly in the polls.\n\nHe sought to allay these fears by only imposing martial law for 30 days in order to \"do away with the pretexts for political speculation.\"\n\nOminously, Putin's spokesman hinted that the imposition of martial law may risk \"escalating tensions in the conflict-hit region\" in the country's east."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/who-are-france-s-yellow-jacket-protesters-what-do-they-n940016", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

A deal is needed in order to keep goods moving across borders that are open under European Union rules, but which will close when Britain pulls out of the trading bloc.\n\nBrexit-watchers are calling it the \u201cTARP scenario\u201d in reference to President George W. Bush\u2019s October 2008 Wall Street bailout; the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program was rejected by Congress, prompting a huge slide in stocks that threatened total economic collapse until Capitol Hill reversed its opposition.\n\nHidden under TARP?\n\nBusiness leaders have repeatedly warned that a \u201cno-deal Brexit,\u201d in which Britain and Europe do not agree on their future relationship, will cause chaos at border points and cripple supply chains. Some government officials are preparing contingency plans to stockpile medicines and other imports while highways leading to customs posts would be turned into miles-long parking lots.\n\nI have now been fingered by @Peston and @EdConwaySky as the originator of the TARP theory of Brexit (markets tank when deal gets voted down, tweaks get made, it passes second time). Just to be very clear - this was a prediction not a recommendation! https://t.co/LKsIboaSMI \u2014 Rupert Harrison (@rbrharrison) November 21, 2018\n\nDespite this looming crisis, many lawmakers, including pro-Brexit members of May\u2019s own Conservative party, believe her proposed deal would be even worse because it surrenders too many political controls to Brussels during a post-E.U. transition period.\n\nThis spurred some policy wonks to float the idea that lawmakers could be forced to set aside their opposition to May\u2019s plan if financial markets are spooked by a potential no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe \u201cTARP scenario\u201d for Brexit was attributed to former government economic adviser Rupert Harrison, who said it was a \u201cprediction not a recommendation.\u201d\n\nHowever, a number of commentators have identified significant differences between May\u2019s Brexit predicament and the Wall Street bailout.\n\nBush\u2019s plan enjoyed bipartisan support from both 2008 presidential nominees, Sen. John McCain and then-Sen. Barack Obama, whereas May is so politically isolated that she barely has the support of her own Cabinet ministers.\n\nTheresa's Frantic Fortnight.

To do that, we need to get on with Brexit now by getting behind this deal.\u201d\n\nIf May wins, the deal goes to the European Parliament in January for final approval."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/russia-attacks-seizes-three-ukrainian-naval-vessels-coast-crimea-black-n939876", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

You, the England people, have our soul,\" said Tarita Alarc\u00f3n Rapu, the governor of Easter Island, during a visit to the British Museum this week.\n\nSpeaking through tears on the museum's grand steps, she pleaded for even a brief loan of the sacred artifact.\n\n\"You have kept him for 150 years,\" she said. \"Just give us some months and we can have it there.\"\n\nTarita Alarcon Rapu gives a press conference outside the British Museum on Tuesday.

Carlos Barria file / Reuters\n\nUnlike in Europe, however, Congress passed two laws in 1989 and 1990 compelling museums and other collections to give back Native American items upon request.\n\nThat's not to say the British Museum hasn't given back some items \u2014 but these have only been loans.\n\n\"The British Museum has, historically, been extremely reluctant to repatriate objects,\" said Alice A. Procter, a historian who gives \"Uncomfortable Art Tours\" revealing the controversial backgrounds of displayed items. \"They make life very, very difficult for anyone claiming cultural heritage.\"\n\nThis tension was directly addressed in the film \"Black Panther,\" when Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, steals a war-hammer on display at the \"The Museum of Great Britain\" \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to the British Museum. As he explains, it was stolen from the imagined African nation of Wakanda.\n\nMichael B.

Or did they take it like they took everything else?\"\n\nThe Wakandan war-hammer echos the story of the real-life Benin Bronzes. In 1897, when European powers were busy carving up Africa, British forces attacked, burned and looted Benin City, an ancient and relatively advanced citadel in modern-day Nigeria.\n\nThe \"massacre of Benin\" brought to an end the Kingdom of Benin, and the British troops returned with a series of ornate bronze plaques that, like Hoa Hakananai\u2019a, are on display at the British Museum today.\n\nThe museum has discussed a possible loan with the Nigerian government \u2014 but a permanent return has never been on the table.\n\nMore infamous still are the Elgin Marbles, statues that once decorated the Parthenon temple in ancient Athens 2,500 years ago.\n\nThe Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon are on display at the British Museum. Edwin Remsberg / VWPics via AP Images file\n\nIn the early 1800s, Lord Elgin gained permission from the Ottoman Empire, where he served as British ambassador, to remove the marble statues, around half of which had been damaged by neglect and war.\n\nThe Greeks disagree. They see the Ottomans of the time as occupiers and have for decades lobbied the U.K. for the artifacts' return.\n\nSo how does the British Museum justify hanging onto these items?\n\nSpokeswoman Hannah Boulton accepts that, at its heart, this argument is about weighing up two things: the museum's mission statement to educate the public and preserve ancient history, and those cultures' right to have their artifacts back.\n\n\"We believe that there is great value in presenting objects from across the world,\" Boulton said, adding that Hoa Hakananai'a is \"among the most popular and most photographed exhibits with our 6 million visitors each year.\"\n\nHoa Hakananai'a. Peter Nicholls / Reuters\n\nOthers point to what can happen when items are left in less secure locations. In 2015, ISIS used bulldozers, power tools and explosives to damage and destroy several archaeological sites, including parts of the ancient city of Palmyra. UNESCO called it \"an immense loss for the Syrian people and for humanity.\"\n\nThis week, the British Museum \"had a warm, friendly and open conversation\" with the Rapa Nui delegation and said \"it was very helpful to gain a better understanding of Hoa Hakananai'a's significance,\" Boulton said. But there has been no offer of its return, on loan or otherwise.\n\nActivists say that the reason this debate has become so difficult to navigate is that Britain has not faced up to the evils committed during its age of empire.\n\nMore than 40 percent of Brits say they are proud of their country's history of colonialism, according to a survey in 2016 by the U.K. pollster YouGov.\n\nThis may owe more to ignorance more than malice. Critics say British schools fails to teach the true impact their country had during that period. The history Britain teaches itself is one of victorious campaigns in World War I and II, rather than the earlier atrocities committed in the name of the empire.\n\n\"The museum conversation is only the first part of a much, much bigger debate in reconsidering the way that colonial history is represented and discussed in the U.K.,\" said Procter, the historian.\n\n\"Museums are very much at the forefront of that because of the repatriation debate, and as part of that, they have a duty to engage and adapt their policies to suit the time,\" she added."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/norway-calling-out-russia-s-jamming-shows-european-policy-shift-n937886", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Now they are openly reprimanding them.\n\nNATO and its partner states have shifted to a \"public engagement campaign, which basically calls people out for cyber attacks, jamming and disruptive behavior to try and deter and discourage it,\" said Jack Watling, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think tank based in London.\n\nThis change was not an official one; there was no speech, written statement or policy document signalling that allies were going to take a different approach.\n\nBut analysts say that it's been clear nonetheless; a demonstrable change of tactic after the ex-spy Sergei Skripal was poisoned \u2014 allegedly on Kremlin orders \u2014 on British soil in March this year.\n\n\"There is a wider policy shift to call out Russia because of the increased intensity of challenges,\" ranging from military threats and spying to hacking and signal jamming, according to Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank. \"That policy-shift is shared by most NATO countries.\"\n\nThe Europeans now feel that \"it does not make sense to address these issues in closed diplomatic sessions with Russia, as Russian diplomats would only deny and outright lie,\" Gressel added.\n\nWith Skripal, U.K. authorities laid out in painstaking detail how two men they identified as agents with Russia's military intelligence agency, commonly known by its old acronym, the GRU, had traveled to the English city of Salisbury and poisoned their target.\n\nTwo men who used the aliases of Ruslan Boshirov, left, and Alexander Petrov, right, were accused of poisoning a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England.

The difference, he added, is that previously we didn't hear about it.\n\nThis is all designed to put pressure on the Kremlin and associated individuals, making them think twice before engaging in behavior the U.S. and Europe are likely to punish, said Watling, the RUSI researcher.\n\n\"Are they prepared to live the rest of their lives in Russia? Are they prepared to not engage in the international financial system?\" Watling said they should be asking themselves.\n\n\"The Russians for a very long time have relied on deniability as a way of doing things that otherwise wouldn't be acceptable,\" he said.\n\n\"Now the message is: Look, we know what you're doing, and it's not okay.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.today.com/video/meet-the-people-racing-to-save-war-torn-syria-s-history-1379843139858", "text": "Meet the people racing to save war-torn Syria\u2019s history 03:54 copied!\n\nSyria is considered one of the most violent and dangerous countries in the world amid ongoing conflicts in the region.

It also raises questions about whether to emerge from decades of conflict, Somalia must also embrace some of the figures behind much of that violence.\n\nMukhtar Robow speaks at a press conference in Baidoa, Somalia, on Oct. 10.

The violence reduced cities to rubble, displaced millions and exacerbated the effects of a long-running drought and famine that left around a quarter million dead in 2011.\n\nThe group has also lashed out across the region, with devastating and coordinated operations including the 2010 World Cup bombing in Kampala, Uganda, that killed 74 people, and the 2013 assault of the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, where at least 67 died.\n\nMap shows location of Somalia. Google Maps.\n\nIn recent years the U.S. has carried out a campaign of airstrikes targeting militant training camps and al-Shabab leaders. The group has been pushed out of Mogadishu, although it continues to control rural areas in the south and central regions.\n\nRobow, who according to American officials was born in 1959, was one of the founders of al-Shabab in 2006. Also known as Abu Mansour, he was inspired by al Qaeda and received militant training in Afghanistan where he has said he met with Osama bin Laden days before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nHe was then instrumental in deploying al Qaeda\u2019s violent insurgent strategy to fight the Somali government and international forces.\n\nIn 2008, Robow was added to the U.S. list of designated terrorists and a multi-million-dollar bounty was put on his head.\n\nBut a rift within al-Shabab, between parts of the group seeking to establish a global caliphate and others like Robow who were more focused on national issues, set him on a new path.\n\nSmoke rises in the aftermath of explosions outside a hotel in Somalia's capital Mogadishu on Nov. 9. Said Yusuf Warsame / EPA file\n\nFearing for his life after a falling out with senior leader Ahmed Abdi Godane in 2013, Robow went into hiding protected by his own loyal militia, until announcing his decision to defect in August 2017.\n\nIn a public address at the time, Robow urged other fighters to leave as well.\n\n\u201cI left al-Shabab because of misunderstanding, and I disagreed with their creed which does not serve Islamic religion, people and the country,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. \u201cI urge the militants to leave al-Shabab.\u201d\n\nRobow\u2019s transformation from militant leader who publicly praised successful suicide attacks to candidate for office was the result of the government\u2019s program of encouraging al-Shabab defections.\n\nHussein Sheikh-Ali, a former government adviser who helped negotiate Robow\u2019s move, said it took three years to convince him to change sides.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t straightforward,\" he said. \"It was on and off and eventually we figured out something and then he just jumped.\u201d\n\nHis defection came just months after the U.S. removed a $5 million reward for his capture and took him off its list of sponsors of terrorism. U.S. sanctions, which prohibit U.S. citizens from dealing with him, remain.\n\nSheikh-Ali, who is also the director of the Hiraal Institute, a security research group in Mogadishu, believes Robow\u2019s transformation is genuine.\n\n\u201cHe wants to defeat al-Shabab,\u201d he said. \u201cHe thinks that they are counter to Somali society. That is his position right now.\u201d\n\nNow Robow is running to become the president of South West State \u2014 one of six federal regions set up to help establish a functioning government.\n\nAnd he is not alone.\n\nA new report from the United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia says about 20 other senior members of al-Shabab have defected \u201cat Robow\u2019s instigation.\u201d\n\nNon-Shabab commanders have also joined mainstream politics.\n\nAhmed Madobe, a former Islamist warlord who ran a powerful militia that fought against al-Shabab for control of the region and its lucrative port in Kismayo, reentered mainstream politics and was elected president of Jubaland State in southern Somalia in 2013.\n\nBut Robow's running for office \u2014 a move announced in October \u2014 might be a step too far. The South West State's regional assembly is set to vote on whether he is eligible for office. While local authorities cleared his candidacy, the central government has announced Robow cannot run because he remains under international sanction.\n\nIt is not clear who gets the final say because Somalia does not have a formal constitution.\n\nAnd so far, Robow also has not been subject to any kind of judicial process or accounting for his past actions.\n\nHundreds of al-Shabaab fighters perform military exercises south of Mogadishu.

She declared Thursday that a solution is \u201cwithin our grasp.\u201d\n\nBut the plans have infuriated pro-Brexit lawmakers in May's own Conservative Party, who prefer a clean break with the E.U. and say the divorce deal would leave Britain a vassal state, bound to E.U. rules it has no say in making.\n\nThey include Raab, who said Friday: \"I'm not going to advocate staying in the E.U. but, if you just presented me terms, this deal or E.U. membership, because we would effectively be bound by the same rules but without the control or voice over them, yes, I think this [deal] would be even worse than that.\"\n\nOthers, including May\u2019s finance minister, say a \"no-deal\" Brexit \u2014 with the U.K. leaving the bloc without reaching any agreement \u2014 would cause chaos at border crossings on both sides, crippling trade and supply chains. They say May\u2019s proposed deal is the only way to implement a voter-mandated Brexit without causing an economic crisis worth billions of dollars.\n\nBritain\u2019s opposition Labour party is also politically divided on the issue.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nNov. 25, 2018, 5:07 PM GMT By Andrew W. Lehren and Emily R. Siegel\n\nAfter years in the military and playing rugby, Wolfgang Neszpor was used to his battered body making noises, but he was stunned when he heard his recently repaired shoulder squeak.\n\n\"It was loud. You could really hear it outside my body,\" he said.\n\nHe went to his doctor, who, when examining him, lifted up his arm.\n\n\"I nearly went through the roof,\" Neszpor recalled. \"I can take a fair bit of pain. But it was a stupid amount of pain.\"\n\nTwo months earlier, Neszpor, 36, had gotten a new shoulder joint made out of carbon. It was a PyroTITAN, made by Integra LifeSciences, a New Jersey company that ranks among the biggest medical device companies in the world.\n\nNeszpor lives in Australia, where his operation was performed in November 2012. He believed the Made in the USA label meant his shoulder would be fixed with state-of-the-art technology.\n\nWhat he did not know is that even though it was made in the USA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not, and still has not, deemed it good enough for Americans. A clinical trial is underway and the company said it hopes to get approval upon completion. But the agency has permitted its sale overseas since earlier that year under an obscure provision in which the PyroTITAN was registered as an \"export only\" device, requiring far less FDA scrutiny than for devices that are sold domestically.\n\nThe PyroTITAN is one of more than a dozen export-only devices with troubled track records identified by NBC News, including U.S.-made implants for losing weight that instead led to emergency surgeries, stents that could cut into arteries they were supposed to save, and heart valves sold in Spain and Italy that, according to the FDA, caused severe infections and may have caused a five-year-old child to die. There may well be more. NBC News found these by analyzing and comparing databases in 10 countries, and a lack of international standards for identifying devices means it is difficult to know how many other troubled devices exist.\n\nFor U.S. companies, exporting medical devices is big business, valued last year at more than $41 billion. Currently about 4,600 devices are registered with the FDA as \"export only\" devices. Several executives for medical device makers said registering the devices is faster, less expensive and has involved less oversight than getting them approved for sale inside the U.S. The troubled devices identified by NBC News have been sold around the world. The destinations range from the Netherlands to Namibia, Chile to Canada, Japan to Germany.\n\nNBC News probed export-only devices as part of a global project organized by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a news organization notable for its work on the Panama Papers, to examine the medical device industry. More than 250 reporters in 36 countries worked on stories that began publishing Sunday.\n\nWolfgang Neszpor, after years in the military and playing rugby, was used to his battered body making noises, but the 36-year-old was stunned when he heard his recently repaired shoulder squeak. Cheryl Goodenough / Redland City Bulletin\n\nThe FDA says its oversight for these products is limited. \"The FDA does not have the authority to take action on export-only devices marketed in other countries simply because they do not meet the agency's requirements for marketing in the United States,\" the agency told NBC News.\n\nThe PyroTITAN already had documented problems before it was embedded into Neszpor's shoulder. The company had alerted the medical community in June 2012 that some models could break. After his surgery, more flaws emerged. In 2013, Australian authorities warned that, for some, the PyroTITAN broke in its first year. A 2016 recall cautioned the device needed so much friction to snap into place that it could burn the arm bone when it was implanted. Out of an untold number of implants, at least 19 patients needed to have the PyroTITAN removed. Neszpor is one of them.\n\n\"That raises a lot of ethical and moral and health questions,\" said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, who helped establish Public Citizen, a consumer health advocacy organization, and frequently testifies before Congress on patient safety.\n\n\"It sort of also raises the question, 'Is an American life worth more than a British life or an Australian life?'\" he said. \"I mean that's the reason they're not being approved here, is because you're protecting an American life. So why would it be okay for another country?\"\n\nLess oversight\n\nWhen Congress, in bipartisan legislation, created the framework for \"export only\" devices, proponents argued FDA oversight should be minimal. Other countries should decide whether a U.S.-made device was good enough for its residents.\n\n\"Why should Congress presume to forbid American manufacturers the opportunity to sell products in these countries after these governments have independently found that such products are legal to make and use?\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, when the law was being created. \"Can we not rely upon the Chinese and Russian governments to act in the best interests of [their] own citizens?\"\n\nThe PyroTITAN is one of more than a dozen export-only devices identified by NBC News with troubled track records. PyroTITAN\n\nAfter the law passed in 1996, the FDA proposed rules to fill in the framework of the legislation. The medical device industry pushed back on several suggested provisions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant was in 2000. The FDA proposed that U.S. manufacturers track alleged problems overseas, in a process called postmarket surveillance. When U.S.-made devices are sold domestically, they undergo that kind of scrutiny.\n\nAdvaMed, the medical device industry's leading trade group, protested, writing to the FDA that the rule \"would impose substantial, unnecessary burdens on device manufacturers\" and cast a \"chilling effect\" on smaller U.S. companies\n\nInstead, AdvaMed countered, medical device makers would meet existing rules by submitting adverse event reports to the FDA. Its adverse event database, with 7.2 million entries, is a key tripwire for the agency to spot problems. But according to the FDA, companies only need to file adverse events for export-only products if they have a similar domestic version of the device. Otherwise, adverse event filings would be voluntary.\n\nIn 2002, the FDA agreed with AdvaMed and abandoned seeking postmarket surveillance.\n\nAn NBC News review found Integra LifeSciences never filed adverse event reports for the PryroTITAN. Company filings show it knew about breaks and burns. Public records in Australia document that at least 19 patients needed revision surgery to replace broken devices. Further review shows at least two other U.S. makers of export-only devices also failed to report adverse events for serious incidents. In these cases, adverse event reporting appears to have been voluntary. The firms do not yet have a domestic version of the products, though they all have indicated they hope to later bring the products to the U.S. market.\n\nIntegra LifeSciences did not respond to questions about why it did not file any PyroTITAN adverse event reports.\n\nBlack powder\n\nFor Integra LifeSciences, the PyroTITAN was once a key to success in Europe.\n\nThe company is headquartered near Trenton, New Jersey, employs about 4,400 and ranks among the world's 50 largest publicly traded medical device companies. A key to its growth is acquiring other businesses. That's how it got the PyroTITAN.\n\nIn 2012, Integra LifeSciences told the investment trade press that it intended to expand in Europe, with the PyroTITAN part of the strategy. The device had been given a CE mark, a designation meaning it was approved for sale in Europe. A 2013 company catalog showed it was also for sale in the Middle East and Africa. Surgeons had implanted it in patients in Italy and New Zealand. The company told investors in 2014 that it hoped to soon win FDA approval for the lucrative U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time the PyroTITAN was sold in the general medical market, it was undergoing a clinical trial in Sweden and another in Sweden, France, the UK and Australia. That is how Neszpor learned of the device. He had undergone previous surgeries and treatments for shoulder injuries. While Australians could get the PyroTITAN in the nation's general medical market, Neszpor's doctor encouraged him to enter the multinational clinical trial.\n\nThe doctor \"persuaded and pushed towards\" the PyroTITAN, Neszpor said, and minimized the risk.\n\nWhen Neszpor returned after surgery because his shoulder squeaked, he recalled his doctor recommended he take fewer pain medications. \"There was no sympathy at all,\" Neszpor said. \"It was just he wanted their thing to work.\"\n\nIn 2014, Neszpor turned to Dr. Desmond Soares, a prominent orthopedic surgeon who has also held governmental and political posts in Australia. After looking at x-rays, Soares was skeptical that the PyroTITAN was the problem. Neszpor pressed him. Soares agreed to surgically peer inside his shoulder. He did not like what he saw.\n\n\"As we opened the shoulder implant, you could see some black powdery stuff,\" the doctor recalled. He spotted a crack in the device. \"As I took that off, underneath in the bone, there were black powdery fragments, which is obviously the disintegrating carbon from the PyroTITAN implant.\"\n\nSoares said Australia's way of evaluating a product for approval is \"very broken\" and questioned how the PyroTITAN was approved for general use. Australia's version of the FDA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, issued a statement that the reason is the PyroTITAN had earned a CE mark, Europe\u2019s version of device approval, given by independent evaluation firms.\n\nOrthopedic surgeon Desmond Soares Tom Hancock / Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nSeveral experts, including Wolfe, said this underscores a flaw in the U.S. export-only process, because regulators in many countries do not conduct their own rigorous evaluations.\n\nAustralian surgeon Dr. Philip Duke, who was one of several doctors in the PyroTITAN trials, defended the product and the clinical trials.\n\n\"I strive to ensure that the research is conducted in full compliance with all applicable regulations and medical ethics guidelines, and with the full disclosure of any known risks to trial participants,\" he said.\n\nWithin several years after Neszpor's surgery, Integra LifeSciences suspended the two clinical trials for the device. The device never lost approval for sale in the Australian and European general markets. Integra LifeSciences has since started a new trial in Australia.\n\n\"Today, the PyroTITAN device meets all regulatory, safety and performance requirements,\" the company wrote in a statement to NBC News, and \"has enabled many patients to regain the mobility of their shoulders.\" The company did not say whether the device had been modified.\n\nThe company noted that Australian government data shows it is \"comparable\" to rivals when tabulating the number of revision surgeries, and Integra LifeSciences monitors the safety of its implant.\n\nThe new Australian clinical trial for the PyroTITAN is due to end in 2020, and if the results are favorable, Integra LifeSciences may then seek FDA approval for sale in the U.S.\n\nHeart valves gone wrong\n\nAt least one U.S. company's export-only devices appeared to have contributed to a death.\n\nShelhigh Inc. of Union, New Jersey, turned cow and pig parts into heart valves for children and grafts for damaged arteries. They were marketed in the U.S., while export-only versions were sold in Germany, Spain, Japan and Italy.\n\nIn 2007, the FDA grew concerned about how Shelhigh did its work, according to court records. Company lab tests showed pathogens in some of the devices, and the FDA said Shelhigh was not taking action. The FDA said devices were made in unsanitary conditions, and that the company had refused to explain how it ensured sterilization.\n\nThe FDA seized Shelhigh's devices, arguing the company violated good manufacturing practices.\n\nShelhigh sued in federal court to get them back, contending the FDA did not have the right to judge its manufacturing since the devices were destined for a foreign market. Regulators in Spain and Italy had deemed Shelhigh's products good enough, it reasoned, so the FDA should not second-guess those decisions.\n\nThe case would become a landmark in the regulation of export-only devices.\n\nA court document shows an FDA inspector found that Shelhigh failed to notify the FDA about adverse events. He stated its devices \"reasonably\" played a role in causing three heart infections, two emergency surgeries and the death of a five-year-old.\n\nThe FDA issued its most serious kind of recall notice because the devices posed a \"reasonable probability that use of or exposure to a product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\"\n\nThe warnings spread. In Ireland, authorities warned Irish citizens who may have been medical tourists and gotten Shelhigh devices while seeking inexpensive care in Italy or Spain.\n\nThe judge sided with the FDA, and some in the medical device industry criticized the decision as a precedent permitting FDA overreach. They believed it could have opened the door for the FDA to regulate export-only devices.\n\nIn a medical law journal, three attorneys who represented device makers wrote the ruling \"could have drastic consequences for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.\" They argued the FDA had no right to judge manufacturing standards for products never sold in the United States, and that this was a \"departure from its historic interpretation of export provisions,\" done without first seeking feedback from the public industry.\n\nShelhigh is out of business. Lea Gabbay, who was a company executive, disagreed with the FDA's portrayal of the firm. The adverse events were \"never, never device-related,\" she contended. \"The product was very much in demand and it was saving lives.\"\n\nInstead, she contended, the FDA \"really wanted us out\" because the business had run afoul of agency \"politics.\"\n\nMimicking gastric bypass surgery\n\nOne company working hard to get back in the good graces of regulators after a series of problems is the Massachusetts firm GI Dynamics.\n\nIt developed the EndoBarrier to mimic gastric bypass surgery. Instead of cutting out part of the bowels, a doctor would insert two feet of plastic tubing into the intestines. The device is designed to help those suffering from obesity and diabetes. It stays in the patient's stomach for up to a year.\n\nThe EndoBarrier was implanted in Dutch, Chilean and Australian patients beginning in 2011.\n\nProblems emerged. Australian authorities issued two hazard warnings for complications, including cuts and bleeding in the digestive system, and concerns about bacterial infections, including pus-filled abscesses on the liver, even after the device is removed.\n\nTon Bogers, who lives in the Netherlands near the Belgian border, said he was debilitated by abscesses on his pancreas after implantation of an EndoBarrier device.\n\nTon Bogers Courtesy Ton Bogers\n\nHe loves riding motorcycles, but was, by his own admission, overweight and suffering from diabetes. Through Google searching he learned about the EndoBarrier. He preferred the less-invasive implanting by a scope rather than stomach surgery. In February 2014, his EndoBarrier was implanted.\n\nAt first Bogers lost weight and was pleased. Then he fell ill and was hospitalized.\n\n\"I screamed through the entire hospital from pain,\" he recalled. He listed ailments including an infection and abscesses on his pancreas. The implant was removed in June 2014. He recounted being in and out of hospitals for two years. He weakened. He needed a feeding tube for a while, lost his job and had to learn to walk again.\n\nThe U.S. FDA halted clinical trials on the EndoBarrier in 2015 because of the abscess problems. The company lost its CE mark in Europe in 2017. An NBC News review of adverse event data found the company did not file adverse event reports with the FDA about the four patients who suffered infections and abscesses leading to the shutdown of the clinical trial.\n\n\"The company was doing an inadequate job,\" said Scott Schorer, the company president and chief executive officer brought in to overhaul GI Dynamics. He said the problems were not about the design of the EndoBarrier, but the company's quality control and oversight. He said the new team emphasizes patient safety, looks forward to re-entering the marketplace, and believes the device is safer than gastric bypass surgery.\n\nThe firm has approval to resume clinical trials and hopes to obtain a new CE mark in Europe next year.\n\nOther troubled devices\n\nAmong the other troubled export-only devices found by NBC News are stents that could cause internal bleeding, inflatable stomach balloons that blocked bowels, and insulin pumps that could malfunction and leave diabetics uncertain if they need insulin.\n\nCordis, a Cardinal Health Inc. subsidiary, sells malleable mesh stents, branded as the S.M.A.R.T. Flex Vascular Stent System, in more than a dozen countries, including Armenia, Jordan, Colombia and Iran.\n\nLast year, the stent was recalled because deploying it inside patients could cause internal bleeding. The company reported that three patients had suffered injuries. Cordis said none of the incidents \"are believed to be related to the device\" but it could not rule out that the stents were the cause. About 2,700 stents were recalled in Germany and elsewhere. Later in the year, the company recalled more than 500 stents because of possible cracks. The company declined to comment.\n\nFor those suffering from obesity in Europe and the Middle East, Allurion, a Massachusetts company, sells a balloon that will expand in the stomach, in the hope that patients will feel full and lose weight.\n\nUK and Saudi Arabian authorities issued warnings in 2016 after two patients experienced malfunctions where balloons filled up too much and lodged inside patients' intestines. The company blamed two bad production lots and recommended doctors consider procedures to go inside patients and tear up the balloons to avoid the risk of blocked bowels.\n\nThe company did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nMedtronic makes many kinds of insulin pumps advertised as \"artificial pancreas[es],\" including the MiniMed 640G. The 640G is sold around the world, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Namibia, Kenya and India.\n\nMedtronic makes many kinds of insulin pumps advertised as an \"artificial pancreas,\" and one is just for the foreign market, the MiniMed 640G. It is sold around the world, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Namibia, Kenya and India. MedTronic\n\nThe export-only product has been the subject of a half-dozen recalls and notifications from 2015 to 2018 for a series of problems covering more than 42,000 devices. These included mechanical malfunctions, problematic pumps, software failures and alarms that did not sound. The concern is that diabetics could become uncertain whether they were getting the proper amount of insulin, which might lead to health problems.\n\n\"Safety is our first and foremost priority, and we adhere to the highest medical, scientific, regulatory and legal standards,\" the company said in a statement to NBC News. \"We keep careful track of our customers around the world so that if we need to notify them of a potential issue with their product, we can do so.\"\n\nBack in Australia, Nezspor believes his life was diminished by the PyroTITAN shoulder, and it has hurt his family.\n\n\"I thought I was really going to get something out of it,\" said Nezspor, the father of six children. \"You sit here and mull over it.

Its operators plan to appeal the decision.\n\nThe Aquarius became a symbol of how governments are imposing restrictions on aid groups helping migrants trying to reach Europe when it was stranded at sea for 10 days in July after being repeatedly refused permission to dock by Italy and Malta.\n\nSOS Mediterranee, which operates the vessel alongside MSF, \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d what it described as a new attempt to \u201ccriminalize humanitarian aid at sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe categorically refute all accusations of participating in illegal activities,\u201d the aid group said in a statement, adding that the Aquarius had always followed rigorous procedures in port.\n\nThe Aquarius is not the first rescue vessel to attract the attention of Italian authorities.\n\nThe Aquarius rescue ship arrives in Senglea, Malta, in August. Matthew Mirabelli / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nIn August 2017, the Iuventa was seized under suspicion of providing \u201cassistance\u201d to illegal migrants and allegedly colluding with smugglers.\n\nSeveral other ships have subsequently been detained by Italian and Maltese authorities on charges ranging from illegally aiding migrants from Libya to not being properly registered.\n\nThese cases, combined with Italy and Malta barring such vessels from allowing migrants to disembark on their soil, have effectively halted rescue operations in the central Mediterranean.\n\nItalian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini on Tuesday highlighted his decision to restrict rescue ship operations in the waters off Libya.\n\n\u201cI have done well to block the NGO boats,\u201d the far-right populist politician tweeted. \u201cNot only have I stopped illegal immigrants but also, it would appear, toxic waste,\" he said, linking to a story on the order for the Aquarius to be seized.\n\nSalvini has previously argued that restrictions on rescue operations exist to prevent Italy from becoming complicit with traffickers who send migrants out to sea knowing that they will have to be rescued.\n\nMeanwhile, the death rate among migrants attempting to cross the central Mediterranean has doubled year-on-year, according to the U.N.'s refugee agency.\n\nA report published by UNHCR in September found that in the first six months of 2018 around one in 18 people trying to complete the sea crossing from Libya to Europe either died or vanished. That compares to a figure of one in 42 people during the same period in 2017, the UNCHR added.\n\nJulia Black, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration, said that with fewer dedicated search-and-rescue operations in the waters off Libya, it was \"extremely likely\" vessels carrying migrants have gone missing without a trace.\n\nLuigi Scazzieri, a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, pointed out that the Italian judiciary is independent and that the prosecutor's decision should not be seen as an order from the anti-immigration populist government."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/fabiano-caruana-could-be-1st-american-world-chess-champion-1972-n937846", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The total cumulative global television and online audience is expected to exceed the 2016 record of 1.5 billion.\n\nThe action resumes Wednesday when the players will try to break a deadlock after eight games.\n\nChess has been boosted in particular by the rise of technology and Silicon Valley. Smartphones allow it to be enjoyed by anyone, anywhere, and the governing F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs (FIDE), or World Chess Federation, says an estimated 600 million people play chess each year \u2014 more than any other game.\n\n\u201cSmart is sexy again,\u201d says Ilya Merenzon, the Russian promoter who is World Chess president and runs FIDE's competitions. \u201cIt is cool to be clever.\u201d\n\nGame of equals\n\nThe last time an American became World Chess champion, Richard Nixon was president, Elvis was in concert and it was the height of the Cold War.\n\nFischer\u2019s 1972 clash with Russian Boris Spassky in Reykjavik was an ideological clash of East versus West and his victory ended a 24-year Soviet winning streak.

Nightly News\n\nAsked whether she fears that what happened to her daughter could happen in other countries, Hughes says, \"That's why I'm here.\"\n\nWerner is the only American diplomat who served in China who the U.S. says is \"medically confirmed\" to have the same symptoms and findings as the 26 U.S. embassy workers who fell ill in Havana. The U.S. government has called what happened in Cuba targeted \"health attacks\" but says it can't identify the cause or culprit.\n\nLast month, NBC News revealed key details about Werner's case and the extraordinary chain of events triggered by a suspected \"health attack\" on a U.S. worker abroad. Now Hughes is coming forward publicly because she says her daughter and the other government workers cannot.\n\n\"It's devastated our lives,\" Hughes says. \"We'll never be the same.\"\n\nWerner is the only U.S. worker in either Cuba or China whose identity is publicly known. None of the Cuba patients have come forward and the U.S. has not named them. Neither Hughes nor her daughter's lawyer, Mark Zaid, objected to her story being made public.\n\nCatherine Werner returned to the U.S. from her diplomatic post in China after reporting symptoms and experiences similar to those of State Department employees evacuated from Cuba. LinkedIn\n\nHughes, too, fell ill and was diagnosed with brain injury after spending time with her daughter in China, medical records reviewed by NBC News show. Hughes is being evaluated by the same doctor in Philadelphia overseeing care for Werner and the Havana diplomats, and is part of a National Institutes of Health study aiming to learn more about the mysterious syndrome.\n\nFor Hughes, the saga started nearly a year ago when she said her daughter's health started declining: nausea, unbearable headaches, and problems with balance, vision and memory.\n\n\"Just struggling and just a shell of what she was,\" Hughes said, recalling how Werner looked during video-chats from Guangzhou. \"She was ashen. Her complexion was off. She looked very, very fatigued.\"\n\nWerner had been hearing unexplained sounds in her upscale apartment and feeling waves of pressure, but didn't connect the dots. Instead, she thought the sounds may have resulted from a malfunctioning air-conditioning unit.\n\nWhen Werner's health worsened, her mother grew so alarmed that she quickly flew to China. She arrived and set about buying new air filters and imported food and water, thinking the city's pollution may have been harming her daughter's health. Nothing worked.\n\nThen Laura started experiencing the sounds and sensations, too.\n\n\"We heard a very high-pitched sound in Catherine's bedroom. And we heard a very low, pulsing sound in the living room,\" Hughes said. \"Our heads would pulse. You would feel like you would want to regurgitate. You could become instantly paralyzed, instantaneously fatigued.\"\n\nBoth Hughes and her daughter also believed they were being surveilled, having noticed signs that their apartment had been broken into. Hughes said they'd discover lights turned on that had been left off, or furniture and other items moved around in obvious signs of an intrusion.\n\nThey adopted a pair of dogs, hoping they would ward off intruders. Soon after, the dogs began acting strangely.\n\nCatherine Werner adopted dogs began experiencing strange symptoms, too. NBC News\n\n\"They would be shivering under the bed when we'd return to the apartment. They would vomit blood,\" Hughes recalled. On one occasion, she said, they came home to find the dogs locked in a room they hadn't been in when Hughes and Werner left the apartment.\n\nHughes starting getting sick, too. She described the feeling as a mental \"fog\" in which everything moved in slow motion.\n\n\"You vomit. You get sick. You feel so sick,\" Hughes said. \"Your head is splitting. You're dizzy. It's a horrible feeling. It's indescribable.\"\n\nAfter three months, Hughes felt she was unable to tolerate it any longer. She headed back to the United States and pleaded with her daughter to come with her. But she said Werner wanted to stay on at her post.\n\nSoon after, embassy security officials started connecting the dots when Werner reported the ongoing suspected harassment and also mentioned the sounds and her symptoms. She was given a series of medical tests, developed after the Cuba incidents to screen potential cases, and her results showed reason for alarm.\n\nSo Werner was evacuated back to the U.S., where doctors at the University of Pennsylvania found vision, balance and hearing problems along with an organic brain injury, medical records show.\n\n\"Their findings were the same as they found for the U.S. diplomats from Cuba,\" Hughes said.\n\nDoctors have said many of the Havana diplomats have brain injuries that look like concussions, except with no known blow to the head. Internal government documents obtained by NBC News show doctors discussing what they're calling a new \"Brain Network Disorder\" acquired by U.S. diplomats overseas, with unique traits never seen before.\n\nAfter Werner's case was confirmed, the State Department tested about 300 more workers in China and evacuated 15 of them to the U.S. for further testing. But other than Werner, the U.S. says none of them is considered a confirmed case.\n\nHughes says that's one reason she is concerned that the U.S. is downplaying what happened in China. She says rather than conducting a transparent investigation, some State Department officials have been \"misinforming and they've been suppressing information.\"\n\n\"Our whole lives are uprooted,\" Hughes said. \"And instead of being helped by the State Department, it's an atrocity how they're taking care of this.\"\n\nStill, Hughes said that on the whole, the U.S. has a \u201cgreat government\u201d that her family has been proud to serve. She expressed gratitude to her and Werner\u2019s doctors at Penn and at Veterans Affairs for their diligence in treating and researching their conditions.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. took \"quick and decisive action\" after a case in China was confirmed.\n\n\"The State Department continues to provide our employees with access to the best medical facilities and doctors in the United States,\" Nauert said. \"We remain vigilant across the globe for any threat to the safety and health of our personnel, their families and U.S. citizens.\"\n\nThe State Department says it still doesn't know \"who or what is responsible for the symptoms that some of our colleagues are suffering.\"\n\nThe strange sounds heard by many of the diplomats in Cuba and China led investigators to initially suspect a sonic weapon. But an FBI report this year ruled out that theory. Now U.S. officials tell NBC News they're considering the possibility of an electromagnetic weapon, possibly involving microwave technology.\n\nBoth Hughes and her daughter remain in intensive rehabilitation to overcome help with balance, vision and cognitive functioning. Hughes says that doctors have told Werner that for the time being, she's unable to work.\n\nSince the Cuba incidents were first reported, skeptics in Congress and elsewhere have suggested they could be psychosomatic symptoms or an outbreak of \"mass hysteria.\" But the U.S. government has said publicly that the concrete medical findings prove that something harmed its workers.\n\n\"Science doesn't lie. These scientists and these doctors and specialists have been working very hard and long on us,\" Hughes said. \"There is no way you can fake this.\"\n\nThe Cuban and Chinese embassies in Washington did not respond to NBC News inquiries about the Werner case. Both Cuba and China have strongly denied knowledge of or involvement in any attacks on diplomats. Cuba has also offered to help the U.S. investigate the alleged attacks."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/feds-have-paid-undercover-informants-migrant-caravan-n938416", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

They are not being devoted to thwarting terrorist threats, mass shootings, mailed fentanyl coming into the country or cyberattacks,\" said Cohen.\n\nCohen said the caravan presents a logistical and humanitarian issue, but because the vast majority of its members want to present themselves legally to claim asylum, it is not wise to devote a significant amount of intelligence resources to it.\n\n\"I find it hard to believe that the highest risk facing this nation comes from this caravan,\" Cohen said.\n\nIt is not known how much money DHS is spending on the intelligence gathering inside the caravan.\n\nIn a statement, DHS Spokeswoman Katie Waldman said, \"While not commenting on sources or methods, it would be malpractice for the United States to be ignorant about the migrants \u2014 including many criminals \u2014 attempting to enter our country.

Brinley Bruton\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in exclamation point-filled formal presidential statement, said Tuesday that his administration would stand by Saudi Arabia's rulers and take no actions against them over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nIn the extraordinary statement, which featured six exclamation points from the president, Trump called the \"crime\" against Khashoggi \"terrible\" and \"one that our country does not condone.\"\n\nBut he again stopped well short of pointing blame at Saudi Arabia \u2014 despite NBC News and other reports last week that the CIA concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's killing \u2014 and cast questions over who killed the journalist.\n\n\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump said in the statement, which featured a subheading that read \"America First!\"\n\n\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\" he continued. \"In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nLater Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the U.S. relationship with Saudia Arabia and the fallout over Khashoggi's murder was \"a shame, but it is what it is.\" He also said he would be willing to meet with the crown prince at next week's G-20 summit in Argentina.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s gonna be there, but if he is, I will,\" Trump said.\n\nFormer CIA director John Brennan responded to Trump's statement by saying that Congress should obtain and make public the CIA's findings about Khashoggi's death.\n\n\"Since Mr. Trump excels in dishonesty, it is now up to members of Congress to obtain & declassify the CIA findings on Jamal Khashoggi's death,\" said Brennan, a scathing critic of Trump. \"No one in Saudi Arabia most especially the Crown Prince \u2014 should escape accountability for such a heinous act.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties, and experts, also reacted critically.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted that, \"You can't just throw in some exclamations (!!!!), yell that the world is dangerous, and call it a press release. That's not how a U.S. President responds to the murder of a journalist and American resident.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calf., said that \"to allow this to happen with no consequences is offensive to every value the United States holds dear.\"\n\n\"Human rights is more than just a phrase, it has to mean something. And that means standing up and condemning a brazen murder by a foreign government,\" added Feinstein, who said she would vote against all future arms deals with the Saudis and urged sanctions against the country's rulers. \"Everyone who played a role in this killing must be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a jab at Trump's \"America First\" justification.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia First, not America First. I'm also pretty sure John Bolton wrote it,\" he said on Twitter, referring to the president's national security adviser.\n\nKristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University's Baker Institute and an expert on Saudi Arabia, told NBC News that Trump's statement was \"one of the most extraordinary\" he'd \"ever seen,\" adding that it \"bears the imprint of John Bolton.\"\n\nKhashoggi, a U.S. resident from Saudi Arabia, was a Washington Post opinion contributor critical of the crown prince's regime.\n\nHis former employer also issued a scathing statement about Trump's remarks, with Washington Post Publisher and CEO Fred Ryan calling the president's response \"a betrayal of long-established American values of respect for human rights and the expectation of trust and honesty in our strategic relationships.\"\n\n\"He is placing personal relationships and commercial interests above American interests in his desire to continue to do business as usual with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,\" Ryan said.\n\nCommittee to Protect Journalists Executive Director Joel Simon added in his own statement that, \"if you boil the White House statement down to its essence, President Trump has just asserted that if you do enough business with the U.S., you are free to murder journalists.\"\n\n\"That's an appalling message to send to Saudi Arabia and the world,\" he added.\n\nTrump, speaking to reporters later Tuesday, said he had no commercial interests in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cI don't get money from Saudi Arabia,\" he said. \"Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with me.\"\n\nThe CIA's assessment had been expected to add pressure on the Trump administration to unleash further punishment on Saudi Arabia despite the president's cordial ties to the royal family there.\n\nThe latest statement seems to all but rule that out.\n\n\u201cThe United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\" Trump said in the statement.\n\nTrump, in the statement, which was titled, \"Statement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia,\" also repeats unsubstantiated smears against Khashoggi that have been perpetuated by the Saudi government, including that Khashoggi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and spreads the Saudi government claim that Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly derided the U.S. press as \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\nIn an interview with reporters, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu responded to Trump's reference to Khashoggi asking, \"Do you think the US would allow him to come here if he was a terrorist?\" Cavusoglu also pointed out that the Muslim Brotherhood was not a terrorist organization and then asked, \"Suppose that he is linked with the Muslim Brotherhood or another organization like this, does this mean he has to be killed like this?\"\n\nTrump, in his Tuesday statement, repeats denials from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi King Salman that they had \"any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\nThe statement makes it clear there will be no additional consequences for Saudi Arabia. Trump reiterated that his administration had already announced sanctions against 17 Saudi Arabian officials over Khashoggi's killing and explained that he would not be cancelling a massive arms deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, despite pressure from some lawmakers to do so.\n\n\"If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\" Trump wrote.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, at a press conference held after the White House statement was released, repeated much of Trump said, telling reporters that \"the United States will continue to have a relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\n\"They are an important partner of ours,\" he said. \"That is the commitment the president made today\u2026 it\u2019s that straightforward.\"\n\n\"It's a mean, nasty world out there. The Middle East in particular. There are important American interests to keep the American people safe, to protect Americans,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in his statement, Trump used inaccurate figures to describe the arms sale. For example, he writes that the Saudis had \"agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States\" and that of that amount, \"$110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.\"\n\nBut according to a study of the deal published Monday by the Center for International Policy, the deal with Saudi Arabia is actually a mixture of orders approved during the Obama administration, a few new offers, and tens of billions in speculative deals. Actual deals implemented since Trump took office total just $14.5 billion, the study found.\n\nIn addition, Trump, in the statement, essentially outlined how the U.S. needed Saudi support to help combat Iranian involvement in the war in Yemen, to help fight terrorism internationally and to help keep oil prices low.\n\n\"The world is a very dangerous place!\" Trump wrote.\n\nIn closing, Trump took aim at \"members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction.\"\n\n\"I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added, \"America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/climate-change-going-make-life-earth-whole-lot-worse-report-n938101", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nNov. 19, 2018, 8:54 PM GMT By Maggie Fox\n\nThink recent climate disasters have been bad? Just wait, researchers at the University of Hawaii predicted Monday.\n\nRight now, one climate-linked disaster generally hits at a time, whether it\u2019s forest fires destroying swathes of California, hurricanes flooding Texas and Louisiana and completely devastating Puerto Rico, or heat waves killing thousands in Europe. By 2100, unless something drastic changes, a new report predicts regions will start dealing with multiple disasters all at once.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be crazy. We cannot imagine what will happen when all these things happen at the same time,\u201d said Camilo Mora, a geography and environment researcher at the University of Hawaii who led the study team.\n\nMora\u2019s team combed through more than 3,200 studies to try to paint a broad picture of what climate change is going to do to people over the coming century. They cross-referenced their findings against known disasters.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to look only at examples were climate change had already caused an effect,\u201d Mora told NBC News. \u201cThe evidence was absolutely mind-blowing to me.\u201d\n\nThe disasters they looked at included drought, warmer temperatures, floods, heavy rain and blizzards, heat waves, fires, sea level rise, storms, changes in the natural land cover and changes in ocean chemistry. \u201cWe found 27 attributes of human health impacted by climate hazards, of which death, disease and mental health were the most commonly observed,\u201d Mora\u2019s team wrote in their report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change.\n\nPeople can die from heat stress, drown during hurricanes, starve during droughts and suffocate in fires. Disease patterns can change as the insects that carry disease proliferate and spread yellow fever, malaria and dengue. The destruction of forests spreads disease, also, the team said.\n\n\u201cFor instance, forest fragmentation increased the density of ticks near people, triggering outbreaks of Lyme disease and encephalitis, fires drove fruit bats closer to towns, causing outbreaks of the Hendra and Nipah viruses, drought mobilized livestock near cities, causing outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever, and melting ice due to warming caused voles to find shelter in homes, increasing hantavirus infections,\u201d they wrote.\n\nChanges in ocean chemistry help cause deadly red tides and can favor the spread of cholera, they added. \u201cDrought forced the use of unsafe drinking water, resulting in outbreaks of diarrhea, cholera and dysentery,\u201d they added.\n\nFires across California and elsewhere worsen asthma and can lead to long-term health problems including heart disease, lung disease and cancer, they noted.\n\nAnd climate hazards have already affected mental health. \u201cFor instance, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were reported after storms in the United States, floods in the United Kingdom and heat waves in France,\u201d they wrote. Loss of sea ice has led to depression among Inuit people who have increasing trouble hunting and fishing.\n\n\u201cEvery single aspect of human life was impacted \u2014 the food and water you eat and drink, the air. It\u2019s making people more vulnerable to violence and forcing people out of their homes. How much of a horror movie do you want?\u201d Mora said.\n\nAnd these are things that have already happened. \u201cI think that it is already pretty bad. Just ask the people in California and Florida,\u201d Mora said. \u201cNow the choices are bad or terrible.\u201d\n\nThe rise of sea levels gets much of the attention that is focused on climate change, but other disasters are already occurring and will become more common, affecting people on every continent whether they live on the coasts or inland. \u201cThe evidence is pretty loud and clear,\u201d Mora said.\n\n\u201cThis is what we are doing to ourselves by being so careless with the release of greenhouse gases. That, to me, is the definition of stupidity: doing something that you know will hurt you.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, there are solutions.\n\n\u201cI am very optimistic that it can be reversed altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only do we have the technology to reduce emissions, but we can restore the ecosystems of the planet.\u201d\n\nOne example: planting trees. For instance, depending on the species, one tree planted in Hawaii can pull a ton of carbon out of the atmosphere in 10 years, because trees take up carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about turning out the lights or walking instead of driving,\u201d Mora said.\n\nSo the university began a challenge to try to encourage people to plant trees to offset their own energy use. The idea came from Mora\u2019s 11-year-old daughter Asryelle Mora Rollo. The university held an event over the weekend to gauge public interest.\n\n\u201cNearly 200 people came to set the record of planting 1,000 trees in one day. We ended up doing it in just two hours,\u201d Mora said. \u201cFor the USA that could mean upwards of billions of trees if everyone does their small contribution,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s something individuals can do on their own or in small groups, Mora said. \u201cIt is low-hanging fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe easiest solution here is for us to stop expecting politicians to do something.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/thousands-flee-guatemala-s-volcano-of-fire-eruption-1375754819783", "text": "Thousands flee Guatemala\u2019s Volcano of Fire eruption 00:41 copied!\n\nRed-hot rock and ash spewed into the sky and down the volcano\u2019s slopes toward an area devastated by a deadly eruption earlier this year.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/jamal-khashoggi-murder-isn-t-mentioned-speech-king-salman-n937861", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Brinley Bruton\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking that it was business as usual in the Saudi capital on Monday during King Salman's annual speech to the country's Shura Council.\n\nJust days after Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor recommended the death penalty for five suspects in the murder of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, the king did not mention the firestorm of controversy swirling around his country. The CIA believes the king's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the killing.\n\nKing Salman Anadolu Agency / Getty Images file\n\nKing Salman did voice support for the kingdom's judiciary, which will be handling the investigation into Khashoggi's Oct. 2 killing in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom was founded on an Islamic approach based on the establishment of justice, and we take pride in the efforts of the judiciary and the public prosecution in the fulfilling the duty entrusted to them, and we affirm that this country will not deviate from the application of God's law,\u201d he said during the speech to the unelected body that advises the absolute monarch.\n\nAfter initially vehemently denying any official involvement in the killing, the Saudis claimed Khashoggi \u2014 a former insider who became a prominent critic of Prince Mohammed \u2014 was killed by a team of rogue operatives.\n\nA series of official leaks have linked the prince to the killing, but the young royal has remained officially untouched by the kingdom's investigation.\n\nOn Friday, NBC News reported that the CIA had concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, according to a person briefed on the assessment. NBC News had previously reported that the U.S. intelligence community believes it's unlikely that Prince Mohammed could have had no connection to Khashoggi's death.\n\nAsked if the CIA had assessed whether the crown prince was behind the killing, President Donald Trump said on Sunday, \"They have not assessed anything yet. It's too early. That was a very premature report.\"\n\nDuring the speech, the king reiterated his support for his son's signature initiative to turn around around the oil-dependent economy and cut unemployment.\n\n\u201cOur country is undergoing a comprehensive developmental plan in accordance with the plans and programs of the kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030, which is proceeding in parallel and achieving its goals at satisfactory rates,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are aware of the efforts of the state to create more job opportunities and we directed the crown prince, the president of the Economic Development Affairs Council, to concentrate and develop the human capabilities and prepare the new generation for future jobs.\u201d\n\nAfter first becoming an international figure in 2015 upon being named deputy crown prince, Prince Mohammed was praised for weakening the country\u2019s powerful conservative clerics and increasing women\u2019s participation in the economy and society \u2014 including granting them the right to drive.\n\nMore recent efforts to silence dissent and a harsh crackdown on fellow princes, business leaders, rights defenders, women\u2019s activists and reforming clerics has raised the alarm, however. The brief kidnapping of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri and break with fellow Gulf kingdom Qatar have also worried traditional allies, including in the United States.\n\nThe king also defended another initiative spearheaded by his 33-year-old son: The disastrous war in neighboring Yemen. The conflict in the desperately poor country has helped created the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster and pushed half of the population, or some 14 million people, to the brink of starvation.\n\nWhile Khashoggi killing crystallized much of the growing international unease with Saudi Arabia, the kingdom as well as Prince Mohammed have become linchpins in the Trump administration\u2019s plans, like containing Iran\u2019s regional ambitions and delivering an Palestinian-Israeli peace plan.\n\nIn May 2017 during Trump\u2019s first visit abroad as U.S. leader, the president announced $110 billion in immediate sales of U.S. arms and equipment, with $350 billion in additional deals over the next 10 years.\n\nWhile it is unclear how much of Trump's announcement covered deals that had already been unveiled, the president has touted such arms sales in an effort to explain the importance of the relationship with the kingdom.\n\nRecently, bipartisan pressure has also been mounting on Trump to distance the U.S. from Saudi Arabia and in particular the crown prince. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, on Sunday harshly condemned the crown prince over the young royal\u2019s alleged role in Khashoggi\u2019s killing, calling the country\u2019s de facto ruler \"unhinged.\"\n\n\"The fact that he didn\u2019t know about it is impossible for me to believe,\" Graham said on Sunday's \"Meet The Press.\" The Republican said he hasn\u2019t been given an official briefing on the matter, but maintained that the conclusion that the crown prince had a role in Khashoggi's murder should be clear to anyone with knowledge about the country.\n\n\u201cIf he is going to be the face of Saudi Arabia going forward, I think the kingdom will have a hard time on the world stage,\u201d Graham said.\n\nOn Thursday, the United States announced sanctions against 17 Saudi Arabian officials in response to the killing."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/brexit-will-put-focus-talents-skills-not-e-u-passports-n937871", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

A British lawmaker has also introduced a bill to ban unions under the age of 18 in England and Wales.\n\nSwedish lawmakers are due to vote on the proposal on Wednesday.\n\nIn 2016, Sweden's Migration Agency said it had identified 132 cases of children who said they were married on asylum applications, but acknowledged there were probably more.

He places a filter-lined funnel atop a glass flask and carefully doles out the speciality coffee \u2014 produced and roasted locally \u2014 in the centre of the filter paper, before pouring the hot water over the top and watching the dark brown brew drip down.\n\nFor now, Juli\u00e1n is learning the skills just for fun, but there\u2019s a larger goal in mind: Low coffee prices, climate change and a rapidly-aging coffee work force mean it's more important than ever to get kids excited and invested in keeping the coffee industry here thriving.\n\nIf kids like Juli\u00e1n don't stay on the land, Colombia's smooth Arabica coffee, served by cafe chains around the globe, could disappear \u2014 but if programs like these succeed, the next generation could preserve Colombia\u2019s centuries-old culture while providing better local jobs and better-tasting coffee for local consumers.\n\nThe library in this town about 130 miles south of Medell\u00edn is housed in the corner of a massive colonial building. One overcast October day, nearly a dozen kids between the ages of 6 and 12 filled the common area used by the Cafeteritos, which is Spanish for little coffee makers.\n\n\u201cI want to run my own coffee shop one day,\u201d says Juli\u00e1n, as he makes the pour-over coffee. \u201cAnd I want kids from all over the world to come and share this coffee with me.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of class, the kids and their instructor sample the final product \u2014 in comparison to the U.S., Colombia has a more relaxed attitude toward childhood caffeine consumption.

He told me that, I would say, maybe five times at different points.\u201d\n\nThe president also asked, \u201cWill anybody really know? He did have certainly people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Graham was asked about the bond between the crown prince, Trump, and Jared Kushner, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave it up to the president to find out how to handle Saudi Arabia from the executive branch side.\u201d\n\n\"From the legislative branch side, we\u2019re going to do as much as we can, as hard as we can, to send a signal to the world,\" he continued. \"This is not how we expect an ally to act. What happened in Turkey violates every norm of civilized society and it will not stand. And if John McCain were alive today, he\u2019d be the first one saying that.\"\n\nGraham also maintained that the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., the crown prince\u2019s brother, Prince Khalid Bin Salman, should not be allowed back in to the United States as ambassador.\n\nAlso on \"Meet The Press,\" Graham publicly called on the president to move forward on the issue of criminal justice reform, asking him to \u201cpick up the phone\u201d and lobby Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring their bill on the issue to the floor.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans are the problem here, not the Democrats,\u201d Graham said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/angela-merkel-s-departure-could-quell-populists-who-forced-her-n931906", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Political instability may force her into a quicker departure.\n\nOnce she is gone, experts say, populists will lose a useful arch-villain in their anti-establishment narrative. That could make it tougher for parties such as the AfD to craft a potent message for voters.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel Sean Gallup / Getty Images\n\n\"For all populists around Europe, Germany included, Merkel's departure will be seen as a major victory,\" said Josef Janning, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a London-based think tank. \"But the populists will find that, once she's gone, things are going to get a little more difficult.\"\n\nPopulism pits ordinary people against a self-interested political and intellectual elite. Merkel, the unofficial figurehead of Europe's wealthiest government, has the perfect blend of character traits to be cast as the adversary in this equation.\n\n\"Merkel has indeed been a useful, clear target,\" said Josefin Graef, a postdoctoral fellow at the Dahrendorf Forum research initiative. \"But ultimately she is a placeholder for a role that needs to be filled in populist politics: the \u2018establishment\u2019 that the AfD seeks to fight.\"\n\nMerkel has ruled her party since 2000 and Germany since 2005, winning four terms and dominating European politics in the process.\n\nHer nonflashy leadership style is the antithesis of the larger-than-life personalities, like President Donald Trump, that have emerged in recent years. She has also received significant criticism, even from some usually pro-immigration quarters, about her perceived mishandling of Germany's borders.\n\nIn direct opposition to Merkel, the AfD has been able to craft its anti-establishment message.\n\nWhen she steps aside, that movement \"will lose her as a 'target' for their specific way of political campaigning,\" Graef said. The populists \"will find it difficult to \u2018replace\u2019 her and will need to diversify their anti-establishment strategy, which is the core of their success.\"\n\nWhether Merkel's departure frustrates the AfD largely depends on who is chosen as her successor at the party's congress next month.\n\n\"The AfD has publicly acknowledged that their future success will depend on who will succeed Merkel, and what policy changes this may imply,\" Graef said.\n\nFor many observers, Merkel has already stolen a march on her rivals by jumping before she was pushed.\n\nMuch is uncertain about how, by staying on as chancellor, she might work with the new leader of her party while holding together the country's ruling coalition. Some argue that, by trying to stay until 2021, she at least has a chance to steward the transition into a new era.\n\nThree candidates for the CDU leadership have emerged so far.\n\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, was chosen by Merkel as the party's general secretary earlier this year, and appears to be the chancellor's choice. Jens Spahn, 38, currently the health minister, represents the party's more conservative wing.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel meets with Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in Berlin on July 2. Hannibal Hanschke / Reuters file\n\nFriedrich Merz, 62, is a rival of Merkel's who recently returned to politics and has described immigration as Germany's greatest challenge.\n\nEach candidate has strengths and weaknesses when it comes to countering the AfD.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer \u2014 or AKK as she's known \u2014 is an experienced political operator but could be tarred with the same brush as Merkel if she is cast too often as the chancellor's preferred heir.\n\nIf either Merz or Spahn take charge, they might steer the CDU to the right, occupying some of the AfD's political territory. However, an attempt by Merkel's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, to outflank the AfD on immigration spectacularly failed during October's state elections. There are also concerns that parroting AfD policy on immigration would amount to capitulation.\n\nThere are some tactics the AfD might deploy against Merkel's successor, according to Graef. These include focusing more on specific policy areas rather than personalities, or ramping up the message that the mainstream parties are too similar.\n\nBut whoever takes over, they are unlikely to be as synonymous as Merkel is with a pro-immigration policy that has so bitterly divided Europe's largest economy.\n\n\"On the one hand, Merkel is a symbol, especially regarding the refugee policy here in Germany,\" according to Stefan Wurster, a professor at the Bavarian School of Public Policy at Munich's Technical University.\n\n\"For the far-right, especially for the AfD, it becomes more difficult to hold this topic in the public arena and also to polarize opinion without the help of this specific person,\" he said. \"But of course, on the other hand, the question is, if Merkel is no longer in office, it depends who is coming next, and what policy the conservatives will have in the coming years.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/estimated-one-million-uighur-muslims-vanish-into-chinese-re-education-camps-1373688899675", "text": "Estimated one million Uighur Muslims vanish into Chinese \u2018re-education\u2019 camps 01:49 copied!\n\nChina only recently admitted that these so called \u201cre-education\u201d camps existed, where former detainees tell NBC News that they were punished for speaking and forced into restraints.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-ordered-khashoggi-killing-1373684291740", "text": "CIA concludes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi killing 02:00 copied!\n\nA new CIA assessment found that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, NBC News confirmed.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nNov. 10, 2018, 11:00 AM GMT By Dan De Luce, Robert Windrem and Abigail Williams\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senior officials in the Trump administration are convinced the Iranian regime is vulnerable to collapse and that tough U.S. economic sanctions could hasten its demise, foreign diplomats and former U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself has questioned if the regime can last.\n\n\"When I came in here, it was a question of when would they take over the Middle East,\" Trump said in an August interview with Bloomberg News. \"Now it's a question of will they survive. It's a big difference in one and a half years.\"\n\nBut European allies and intelligence experts disagree, and see Washington's forecast as a case of wishful thinking. While acknowledging the regime's growing economic and political troubles, European governments believe the Iranian leadership remains firmly entrenched and that any attempt to topple the government could produce a worse outcome, the diplomats said.\n\nIn meetings with foreign counterparts, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton and other officials have argued the regime is fragile and increasingly unable to manage a troubled economy and a frustrated population, according to nine foreign diplomats. They cite rising inflation, strikes and sporadic protests as telltale signs of a regime at risk, and that U.S. sanctions on its oil exports \u2014 which came into effect this week \u2014 could deal a crippling blow that will force Tehran to abandon its military adventures in the Middle East or even lose its grip on power.\n\n\"That's their logic,\" said one European diplomat, who disagrees and spoke on condition of anonymity. \"They are saying the regime is going to fall.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have also not detected signs that the Iranian regime is on the verge of unravelling, U.S. officials told NBC News. They see a regime that appears to be just as firmly in control as it has been for years. But they said they do see a country with mounting headaches, and think U.S. sanctions aimed at cutting oil revenues could cause real difficulties for the regime\n\n\"The Trump administration's policies appear designed to add to the political stress which already exists within Iran,\" a former U.S. intelligence official said.\n\nPompeo, Bolton and other top officials publicly insist the administration is not pursuing regime change, and that their policy is merely aimed at changing the regime's behavior.\n\n\"We certainly don't like this regime. It's a deeply hypocritical religious dictatorship that robs its people blind,\" a State Department official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told NBC News. \"Ultimately, it's up to the Iranian people to decide what government they want to live under. ...We want the Iranian people to be successful. We hope they can restore democracy there.\"\n\nBolton has a long track record of public statements calling for weakening the regime and ultimately replacing it. Eight months before he was named by Trump to his current job, Bolton gave the keynote address to the annual convention of the Peoples' Mujahedin of Iran, an anti-regime group known in the Iran as the MEK: \"I have said for the over 10 years that I've been coming to these events that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs' regime in Tehran.\"\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton, left, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attend a meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 11, 2018. Handrew Harrer / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn language reminiscent of Cold War rhetoric, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has made a point of expressing solidarity with the Iranian people and appeared to invite them to oust the clerical leadership.\n\n\"In light of these protests and 40 years of regime tyranny, I have a message for the people of Iran: The United States hears you; the United States supports you; the United States is with you,\" Pompeo said in a July speech before an audience of Iranian-Americans in Los Angeles.\n\n\"And you should know that the United States is not afraid to spread our message on the airwaves and online inside of Iran either,\" said Pompeo, announcing plans to launch a 24-hour Farsi-language channel.\n\nThe administration has launched an aggressive information war against Iran on social media and a virtual embassy site, ridiculing Iranian leaders over corruption, air pollution, water shortages and the repression of dissidents.\n\nHawks close to the administration see many parallels between Iran and the former Soviet Union, and maintain that the current president could play a role similar to former President Ronald Reagan by taking a tough, uncompromising stance toward the regime in Tehran.\n\n\"We don't know that the regime is going to collapse. And we don't know when,\" said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which backed the administration's exit from the Iran nuclear deal. \"But we sense that this regime is a lot weaker than people believe, and that there's something rotten at the heart of the Islamic Republic in the same way that there was something rotten at the heart of the Soviet Union.\"\n\nThe Soviet analogy has sparked an internal debate among conservatives in Washington, with commentator and author Fred Kagan cautioning that the comparison is not precise and that the rulers of Iran could yet hold on to power for some time.\n\nIran's economy has come under serious strain over the past year, partly because of renewed U.S. sanctions and partly because of years of government mismanagement, experts say. The rial has plunged to record lows, losing 70 percent of its value. The IMF predicts the average inflation rate could surpass 34 percent next year, major European firms have pulled out and there are periodic shortages due to panic buying of staples. Teachers and truck drivers have staged strikes and thousands protested in cities across the country in December and January over rising prices and alleged government corruption.\n\nEuropean diplomats and experts say the protests and strikes are focused on specific grievances and have not evolved into a broader political movement.\n\n\"It would take a lot more than what's happening now to produce a collapse or regime change,\" said another European diplomat who asked not to be quoted by name.\n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani has warned the country that U.S. sanctions will cause economic pain but vowed his government would resist the pressure.\n\n\"We are in a war situation,\" Rouhani said. \"We are in an economic war situation. We are confronting a bullying enemy. We have to stand to win.\"\n\nUnlike a previous pressure campaign led by the Obama administration between 2012-2015, the United States is leading a unilateral sanctions effort without political support from Europe and with Russia signaling it intends to throw Iran an economic lifeline.\n\nEven if Iran survives the latest squeeze by Washington, the Islamic republic appears to be descending into a long-term decline, said the former U.S. intelligence officer.\n\nThe Islamic republic's \"revolutionary energy has dissipated over the years,\" he said, and the country's youth are acutely aware of a more open, prosperous life elsewhere.\n\nHe cautioned, however, that the end is not necessarily near, in part because the Revolutionary Guard is well-placed to crush opposition and maintain the regime's hold.\n\n\"Although Iran appears increasingly fragile, it does not appear on the verge of a collapse,\" he said. The Revolutionary Guard \"appears to remain well-resourced, organizationally-cohesive, and its units are distributed around the country.\"\n\nAnother former intelligence officer, John McLaughlin, who served as deputy director and acting director of the CIA, said that the regime at the moment faces no organized, unified opposition.\n\n\"Major outbreaks against the government, in 2009 and before have been hampered by factionalism among the protesters and no unified leadership -- making it relatively easy for security forces to squelch opponents,\" McLaughlinsaid.\n\n\"I've seen no evidence that this has changed, so we should not hold our breaths waiting for the great successful uprising along the lines of what we saw in Eastern Europe 30 years ago.\"\n\nA vehicle burns as demonstrators protested high prices and the poor state of the economy in Dorud, in Iran's Lorestan province, on Dec. 30, 2017. SalamPix / Abaca/Sipa USA via AP\n\nGiven the absence of a viable opposition, destabilizing the regime could merely produce an even more aggressive government dominated by the well-armed and well-funded Revolutionary Guard, former officials and European diplomats said.\n\n\"They don't have a plan for what comes next,\" said one diplomat. \"It's very scary.\"\n\nIf the regime did unravel, it's unlikely it would produce a straight-forward transition to a more responsible or more representative government, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"There's just no precedent in the region's history or Iran's history that this all ends all quickly and neatly and to our advantage,\" Maloney said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/100-years-after-wwi-armistice-u-s-role-remembered-french-n931921", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Twenty-six thousand died during just seven weeks of combat in 1918, when 1.2 million American troops, led by Gen. John J. Pershing, fought to advance on German positions.\n\nThe Meuse-Argonne offensive remains America's deadliest battle, and while it helped force the end of the war, its cost can be seen in the sweeping rows of gravestones at St Mihiel, which lies in northeast France, about 50 miles from the German border.\n\n\u201cThey are so important because you can\u2019t forget what these men and women did for us,\u201d said Jeff Hays, the cemetery\u2019s superintendent. \u201cIf these men and women didn\u2019t go and fight for us 100 years ago, where would we be now?

While working the vineyards over the last few decades, he has often found other reminders, including a type of cigarette lighter he believes was handed out to German soldiers.\n\nDespite the hardships of World War I and the toll it took on his family\u2019s land, the Ariston family has produced champagne for five generations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to always keep in our minds that we arrive to do the peace, to keep the liberty, because the Americans came to help us,\u201d said Ariston\u2019s son, Paul-Vincent.\n\nA special connection\n\nIn nearby Fismes, memories of the war run deeper.\n\nThe front line ran through this town of 5,500, and a combination of fighting in the streets and heavy artillery destroyed 90 percent of its buildings. The arrival of American soldiers turned the fighting in favor of the French.\n\nSince the end of WWI, there has been a special connection with the American people, the town\u2019s mayor Jean-Pierre Pinon said.\n\n\u201cThere is a relationship from people to people, not just from government to government,\u201d he said.\n\nJean-Pierre Pinon, mayor of Fismes, said his town will forever be grateful for the service of American soldiers who liberated it at the end of World War I.

The law mandates that Ukrainian language be used exclusively in secondary schools, even in the country's ethnic enclaves, to help minorities integrate.\n\nBut Hungary saw the move as a violation of minority rights.\n\nBudapest's actions to undermine Ukraine\u2019s cohesion is \"pressure from another flank on Kyiv,\u201d said Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow with the London-based Chatham House think tank.\n\n\u201cThis is a new pressure point for Ukraine,\u201d Lutsevych added, warning that the situation could \"get out of control.\"\n\nHungary has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cDual nationality is everyday practice within the E.U., and accordingly the Ukrainian objections do not indicate that Kyiv is serious about European integration and joining NATO,\" Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijj\u00e1rto said after the video emerged.\n\nUkrainian officials believe more than 100,000 Hungarian passports have been handed out to Ukrainian citizens of Hungarian descent in Zakarpattia in recent years.\n\nOrban, who is known for his strong anti-migrant stance and tight control of the media, has openly condemned Western sanctions against Russia and accused the E.U. of having a \u201cone-sided\u201d policy towards Moscow.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban has been in power since 2010. Michaela Rehle / Reuters file\n\n\u201cThe changing nature of Hungarian government with Orban being more aligned with autocracy and having links or a kind of common understanding with the Kremlin and Putin, suddenly makes Ukraine very nervous about Hungarian policy in Zakarpattia,\u201d Lutsevych said.\n\nBut that policy goes back decades, according to Balazs Jarabik, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nAfter losing much of its territory in the aftermath of World War I, Hungary has long tried to engage with and protect its ethnic communities abroad.\n\nJozsef Antall, the first democratically elected Hungarian prime minister, famously stated in 1990 that he considered himself the leader of 15 million Hungarians \u2014 not only the 10 million living within its borders.\n\nIn 2011, Hungary passed a law to make it easier for ethnic Hungarians living abroad to obtain citizenship. To date, more than one million Hungarian passports have been handed out to ethnic Hungarians in a handful of neighboring states \u2014 including Ukraine.\n\nBut despite Hungary\u2019s cornerstone policy of building symbolic ties with its communities abroad, the video that emerged from Berehove doesn\u2019t come across as a \u201ckosher\u201d practice to the government in Kyiv, according to Jarabik.\n\nEven though Hungary maintains that the granting of passports in Berehove was legal, he says the political climate means it is being seen as a potential threat in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFor Ukrainians, this reminds them of Russian practices and anything that reminds Ukrainians of Russian practices is obviously a security challenge,\u201d Jarabik said.\n\nHungarian officials have previously called suggestions that their policy in Zakarpattia is serving Russian interests \"an abject lie.\"\n\nJarabik said Ukraine might be using the footage and diplomatic spat as a way to \"mobilize patriotic voters.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cHungary has kind of become a sparring partner in this. And Hungary is not Russia ... Kyiv knows that there is no real threat from Hungary.\u201d\n\nLutsevych says instead of engaging in a blame game with Budapest, Kyiv needs to build meaningful dialogue with ethnic Hungarians in Zakarpattia.\n\n\u201cHungarian communities there are not willing to engage with Kyiv to discuss their problems,\u201d Lutsevych said. \u201cThey are more willing to engage with Budapest and that\u2019s not normal.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pompeo-s-talks-north-korea-are-postponed-without-explanation-n933356", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The website also claimed it knew the results of the election, despite having obvious errors such as predicting a win by Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who did not run for re-election.\n\nThe website drew little attention despite efforts to tip journalists to its presence, and a survey by NBC News of social media accounts associated with the website showed that the campaign appeared to have had far less reach than the 2016 campaign that garnered millions of social media interactions and even tricked mainstream news outlets.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s relatively low impact left some experts wondering if Russia\u2019s ability to manipulate social media campaigns is diminishing \u2014 or if the country\u2019s multimillion-dollar influence campaign was bluffing after what appeared to be a failed disinformation operation.\n\nClint Watts, a former FBI agent who is an NBC News contributor, said the website along with the Twitter accounts and YouTube videos associated with it appeared to be the final part of a weekslong strategy aimed at baiting American media outlets into amplifying talking points about Russia\u2019s election hacking threat.\n\nWatts said inflating the impact of operations is \u201cas old as any Soviet disinformation strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re overt and sloppy, they\u2019re trying to convince you of something they didn\u2019t actually do,\u201d Watts said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re covert and they\u2019re found out later, they\u2019re trying to convince you of something they\u2019re actually trying to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also trying to show, \u2018A-ha, these social media companies can\u2019t stop us.\u2019\u201d\n\n55 Savushkina street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, a location used by the Internet Research Agency .

Thirteen IRA employees based in St. Petersburg were indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller in February for meddling in the 2016 election, and another employee of the Kremlin-funded group was indicted last month for meddling in the midterms.\n\nOn Monday, Facebook announced it had taken down dozens of accounts on Instagram after a tip from law enforcement. NBC News flagged the IRA website to Facebook when it posted the names of the accounts on Tuesday.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson confirmed to NBC News that some of the accounts listed on USAIRA.ru were the same ones pulled from Instagram. Other accounts listed on the site, which had evaded detection, were pulled off of Instagram late Tuesday night by Facebook. Facebook cited U.S. government intelligence that had identified some of the accounts in its determination that the accounts were created by the IRA.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the Department of Homeland Security said foreign influence campaigns remained active around the election.\n\nThe troll accounts ran the political gamut from fake liberal fan pages that supported CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert to accounts purporting to be run by far-right Infowars fans. Apolitical accounts trying to cast a wide net \u2014 like one called Fit Black Queens, which mostly posted women in workout clothes and had more than 1 million interactions \u2014 and far-right conspiracy accounts appeared to gain the most traction. Many of the new IRA accounts trafficked in the same tropes from the 2016 election, but have had less reach.\n\nOn Election Day, the website flaunted a massive influence campaign it claims went undetected, but did not provide much evidence as to its effectiveness.\n\n\"Whether you vote or not, there is no difference as we control the voting and counting systems. Remember, your vote has zero value,\" read text on the website. \"Facebook and intelligence agencies tried to stop us but they only managed to uncover 1/25 of the whole picture.\"\n\nAlex Stamos, a former Facebook chief security officer and now an MSNBC contributor, said that the midterms influence operation \u201clooks like an effort by the Russian troll factory to try to turn lemons into lemonade,\u201d and drum up fear in the American electorate.\n\n\u201cMost of the posts we observed looked to be aimed at building audiences to be manipulated later, which would be consistent with past Russian Internet Research Agency operations,\u201d Stamos said.\n\nBefore polls closed, the IRA site also posted a spreadsheet claiming to know the results of every Senate contest in advance.\n\n\u201cThe list of projected winners was laughably incorrect,\u201d Stamos said.\n\nThe people behind the website also appeared to try to stir up media coverage for the influence campaign. An NBC News reporter was sent a link to the USAIRA.ru website in a Twitter direct message on Sunday night. ThinkProgress disinformation reporter Casey Michel also received a message.\n\n\u201cDo you still worry about Russians controlling your selection? That is true.

The same day, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said all sides needed to take meaningful steps toward a cease-fire and begin negotiations in the next 30 days.\n\nThe comments raised the prospect that the Trump administration is getting tougher with the Saudis over their military campaign against Iran-linked Houthi rebels, which has killed more than 10,000 people in the desperately poor country since 2015. All sides have been accused of violating international law and committing war crimes.\n\nA girl suffering from severe malnutrition is weighed at a hospital in Yemen on Oct. 25. Essa Ahmed / AFP - Getty Images\n\nWashington supports Saudi Arabia and its ally, the United Arab Emirates, through billions in arms sales. It also refuels their jets mid-air, provides training and shares intelligence. So if the U.S. wants to try to force the Saudis' hands, it has leverage.\n\nThe best way to force the Saudis to change their ways is to stop sending weapons, according to Human Rights Watch\u2019s Yemen researcher Kristine Beckerle.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so many violations already over the past three and a half years, so what Pompeo and Mattis should be doing is saying, \u2018These are the benchmarks. We\u2019re going to hold up weapons sales until you actually fulfill these tasks,\u2019\" she said, referring to the apparent bombing of civilian sites by the coalition.\n\nAmerican arms deliveries to the Saudis reached $5.5 billion last year, up from $1.7 billion in 2009, according to the U.K.-based Campaign Against Arms Trade which compiled the figures using Department of Defense statistics.

American officials have also been keen to focus on what they say is the country's key role on combating terrorism and fighting Iranian influence throughout the region.\n\nAndrew Smith of the Campaign Against Arms Trade said last week's calls for a cease-fire by Mattis and Pompeo were long overdue.\n\n\"Over the last three and a half years Saudi-led forces have inflicted a terrible humanitarian catastrophe on Yemen,\" he said. \"We hope that the current pressure can serve as a turning point. For far too long, arms-dealing governments have prioritized arms company profits over the rights and lives of Yemeni people.\"\n\nOver the summer, lawmakers included a provision in a defense bill requiring the administration to certify Saudi Arabia and its allies were trying to reduce civilian casualties in Yemen.\n\nIn August, the coalition bombed a school bus carrying children, killing dozens.\n\nThe deadly strike prompted international outrage.

Abbas was among many farmers who led peaceful demonstrations after prolonged drought and the withdrawal of government water for irrigation made planting staple crops impossible this year.\n\n\u201cThere was a rumor that the protests are the first step of an uprising,\u201d said Abbas, adding that many local people fear another year of dry conditions could affect the availability of drinking water.\n\nAnimosity\n\nSyria\u2019s seven-year civil war is also seen by some experts as an example of how water shortages can worsen already tense circumstances. Drought didn\u2019t spark the conflict but it did push many unemployed farmers into cities where poverty and frustration encouraged some people to extreme action, Oregon State University's Wolf said.\n\nThe effects of that war has been felt in neighboring countries, including Jordan, that now struggle to support the millions of refugees that put more pressure on resources. Conflict also halts any potential for negotiating water-sharing deals or building shared infrastructure.\n\n\"If there is not enough water for people to drink or cultivate crops in the Middle East, and that\u2019s a big concern, those people may need to leave the areas where they live and that could lead to destabilizing migration. It could also lead to an escalation of violent protests,\" said Charles Iceland, director of global and national water initiatives at the World Resources Institute.\n\nIceland pointed to Iran as a particularly vulnerable country for escalating incidents in the future if supplies are reduced by climate conditions or upstream countries.\n\nEarlier this year, protests became violent in the southwestern province of Khuzestan as farmers grappled with water shortages. The government denied any deaths occurred but Al Arabiya news channel reported at least four demonstrators were fatally shot.\n\nIsrael has long treated water as a national security issue and has become a global leader in building desalination plants, operating five facilities in predominately public-private partnerships.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that the pressure on water resources has been eliminated. Israel, like Jordan, faces problems ranging from overconsumption to heavy pollution.\n\nWolf, who specializes in transboundary water conflicts, believes the political rhetoric between Jordan and Israel is typical chest-thumping ahead of negotiations over the Island of Peace and not a sign that the overall treaty is at risk.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day they will sit down,\" he said. \"There is no way out except to cooperate.\"\n\nThe Jordan River runs through the Baqoura area, which is also known as the Island of Peace.

She worries it could be a signal that leaders are changing their approach.\n\nWhile King Abdullah's move lines up with public animosity toward Israel, Abu Taleb said many Jordanians don't understand how complex the country's water challenges are and how the peace treaty is integral in resolving them.\n\nEven before Israel threatened last week to cut the amount of water it shares, rising tensions could already be seen in communities in Jordan.\n\nNeighbors in a once close-knit farming town of Al Karameh quarreled one recent morning after the taps in their homes ran dry.\n\n\u201cAll people need water to drink, to wash,\u201d said Roshka Tayyem, a politician, before getting sucked into the heated argument in the middle of the road.\n\nRoshka Tayyam.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nNov. 3, 2018, 2:01 PM GMT By Dan De Luce, Ken Dilanian and Robert Windrem\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Ritz-Carlton in Saudi Arabia's capital bills itself as an \"elegant oasis\" that \"completely envelops its discerning guests in majestic surroundings.\"\n\nBut a year ago Sunday, on Nov. 4, 2017, the ultra-luxurious Riyadh hotel \u2014 with its marble floors and vast indoor swimming pool \u2014 became a gilded prison, when hundreds of Saudi royals, billionaires and senior government officials were detained in an extraordinary power play by the heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe involuntary guests were told they had to sign away large chunks of their assets to be released. The detention involved both psychological abuse and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 torture, current and former U.S. officials say.\n\nThe move, described by Saudi authorities as a crackdown on rampant corruption, allowed the crown prince to tighten his grip and sent a shock wave through the kingdom's elites.\n\n\"This was a shakedown operation and a power consolidation operation,\" said one former senior U.S. official who was in office at the time.\n\nThe Ritz detentions were designed \"to remind people going forward that their wealth and their well-being would depend on the crown prince and not anything else, which is why it was so upsetting for many in the royal family,\" said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nA year later, the event has taken on even more importance in the wake of the death of the Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Bin Salman is suspected of ordering Khashoggi's death, and is struggling to defuse the crisis that has put the country's international standing in jeopardy.\n\nIf bin Salman survives the fallout over the killing of Khashoggi, it will be in part due to the roundup at the Ritz, when he crushed his rivals and potential opponents. Some of those targeted included royals or officials linked to the late King Abdullah, who died in 2015. His relatives and associates are distrusted by the circle around King Salman, who now holds the throne.\n\nBut the crackdown generated deep resentment in the House of Saud and numerous enemies, experts and former officials said, and the crown prince could face more resistance from his internal adversaries. Bin Salman, keenly aware that Saudi Arabia's King Faisal was murdered by a disgruntled nephew in 1975, devotes elaborate attention to his personal security, one former U.S. intelligence officer told NBC News.\n\nThe details of exactly what happened to those detained at the Ritz have remained shrouded in secrecy, and the fate of those still held also remains unclear. A second hotel, the Courtyard by Marriott, located just across the street from the Ritz, was also used as a high-end detention center when space ran out at the Ritz. Both hotels were closed to the public during the operation. The Ritz did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA U.S. intelligence official and two former senior U.S. government officials told NBC News that the detainees were coerced, abused and tortured. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to divulge details, which were contained in classified intelligence reports.\n\nThe detainees were deprived of sleep, beaten and interrogated with their heads covered. Seventeen were hospitalized, according to the New York Times.\n\nOne detainee, a Saudi military officer, Maj. Gen. Ali al-Qahtani, died in custody. The Saudi authorities have yet to offer an official explanation in the case. He was a top aide to Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a son of the late King Abdullah.\n\nSaudi Arabia has denied that any abuse or torture took place during the detentions. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the time, President Donald Trump endorsed the crackdown in a tweet: \"I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing. Some of those they are harshly treating have been 'milking' their country for years!\"\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet came on Nov. 6, two days after the crackdown came to light. The next day the State Department said it would like to see prosecution of corruption in a \u201cfair and transparent manner.\u201d\n\nI have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2017\n\nTrump's apparent approval of the operation raises the question of whether Washington missed an opportunity to make clear to the crown prince last year that he needed to ease off of authoritarian measures or else risk a U.S. backlash, said a former senior government official with experience in the region:\n\n\"It should have been a warning to us where this was going,\" said the former official.\n\nAmong the nearly 400 detainees was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a high-profile tycoon with investments in Citigroup and Apple, estimated to be worth more than $17 billion.\n\nAlwaleed was summoned to the royal court in the early morning hours of Nov. 4, having no inkling the crown prince had launched a sweeping roundup of the country's most powerful and wealthy figures.\n\nAlan Bender, a Canadian businessman with ties to the Saudi royal family, told NBC News he represented an ex-wife of Alwaleed, who had alleged she was mistreated by the billionaire. Before the November roundup, Bender had been pressing Alwaleed's lawyers to pay his client a financial settlement. After Alwaleed was detained, Bender was flown to Riyadh to \"testify\" against the prince. Bender said he did so via video-conference, reading a script of allegations while Alwaleed sat in an undisclosed location on the other end of the video chat.\n\nBender said it appeared that Alwaleed was in a room that resembled a jail cell, rather than a hotel suite. He also said al-Waleed seemed to be in rough shape, fatigued, unshaven and twitching.\n\n\"He looked like he hadn't slept,\" Bender said.\n\nWhile in Riyadh, Bender said, he learned more about the Ritz operation.\n\nBender said that a top adviser to the crown prince named Saud Al Qahtani \"bragged to me that they slapped and hung some detainees upside down.\" That same adviser has since been sacked, along with other top officials, after the killing of the Saudi dissident Khashoggi.\n\nAlwaleed was finally released after 83 days, looking underweight. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Alwaleed insisted he was not mistreated and that he and the Saudi government had come to a \"confidential\" understanding. The prince did not respond to requests for comment by NBC News.\n\nLast month, Alwaleed appeared at an investment summit in Riyadh, with footage showing him sitting just a few seats away from the crown prince.\n\nSaudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, left, with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, second right, at the Saudi Arabia's investment conference, in Riyadh on Oct. 23, 2018. Fares Ghaith / EPA\n\nAfter the Ritz crackdown wound down, most remaining detainees were moved to Al Hayer jail, former U.S. officials said.\n\nSome of the former detainees have been placed under house arrest, are required to wear ankle monitors or are banned from travelling abroad, the former officials said.\n\nThe Saudi attorney general's office said in a statement in January that 381 individuals had been \"subpoenaed\" in corruption cases and 56 would remain in custody, because they \"refused to settle\" or they were subject to other pending criminal cases.\n\nSaudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, son of the late King Abdullah and head of the National Guard, a powerful 100,000-strong security force charged with protecting the royals, was released after three weeks in detention and after he reportedly agreed to pay more than $1 billion in a settlement.\n\nHis brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh province, remains under detention, the former officials said.\n\nThe Saudi government portrayed the whole clampdown as a successful effort to clean up corruption. Saudi authorities said in January that the government had reached settlements worth $106 billion. It's not clear how much of that is in the form of cash, and how much in real estate or other holdings, which could take months or years to transfer.\n\nThe government reportedly seized the management of some firms, including Saudi Binladin Group, the giant construction company founded by Osama bin Laden's father. The chairman, Bakr bin Laden, was among those detained last year. The company did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEven before the Ritz detentions, the crown prince's impulsive ways had sparked jitters among foreign investors and the country's wealthy elite. Foreign direct investment has plunged in the past two years and Saudis have moved cash and assets out of the country at a dramatic rate.\n\nThe Ritz detentions only reinforced concerns for businesses looking at the Saudi market.\n\n\"The takeaway was if you get on the wrong side of this guy, then your investments and your deal could be at risk. That's a chilling message,\" said Phillip Cornell, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and former adviser to the kingdom's state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-s-xi-retired-u-s-general-have-both-brought-n929681", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Now, officials past and present from both countries seem to be talking up the possibility of a shooting war.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping told his forces on Oct. 25 to \"concentrate on promoting preparedness for war and fighting a battle.\"\n\nA day earlier, a former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe predicted a conflict between the global powers.\n\n\"I think in 15 years, it's not inevitable, but it is a very strong likelihood that we will be at war with China,\" retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges said at the Warsaw Security Forum in Poland.\n\nHis comments echoed those of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who said in 2016: \"We're going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years, there's no doubt about that.\"\n\nBannon pointed to a network of military bases Beijing has built on artificially enlarged coral reefs in the hotly contested body of water. The militarized outposts feature runways, sea ports and multi-story buildings, and there have even been reports of missile deployments.\n\nChinese dredging vessels in the waters around Fiery Cross Reef in the South China Sea in 2015. Reuters file\n\nMany experts say that type of tough talk carries grave risks. But most believe the world is a considerable ways away from a war between its two largest economies.\n\n\"There's clearly been a sharpening of the rhetoric between the two countries, and we're currently seeing a real push in a worrying direction,\" says Raffaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank based in London. \"There's a genuine concern it might end up somewhere horrible.\"\n\nXi didn't mention any enemy by name when he made the comments, but they came up during a tour at the Southern Theater Command, in Guangdong province, which is responsible for monitoring Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nChina claims a huge chunk of this sea as its own, giving it control over a crucial, oil-rich choke-point through which $5.3 trillion of trade passes every year.\n\nIt was there in September that a Chinese warship came within 45 feet of colliding with the USS Decatur. The near-collision was during one of the fairly regular voyages by U.S. ships and planes into the waters, an attempt by Washington to show Beijing that it can't restrict freedom of passage.\n\nThe USS Decatur in the South China Sea in 2016. Petty Officer 2nd Class Diana Quinlan / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nExperts predict it won't be the last time. The United States and China \"will meet each other more and more on the high seas,\" Adm. John Richardson, the chief of U.S. Naval Operations, said at an event in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Tuesday.\n\nHodges said September's maritime near-collision was only one example of \"an increasingly tense relationship.\"\n\nOther points of friction, Hodges said, are China's vast infrastructure projects in Asia, Europe and Africa, as well as its \"constant stealing of technology.\"\n\nThen there's Taiwan. China considers the island a runaway province; the United States has sold it $25 billion of arms since 2007. When the Trump administration approved the sale of $330 million of F-16 parts in September, Beijing said it lodged \"stern representations\" against the move.\n\nWhile it's not in U.S. or Chinese interests to start a war, one way that might happen is through a misunderstanding or bad communication, especially if animosity over the trade war means the sides stop speaking with each other.\n\n\"The Chinese might think, 'We're going to build a base here,' and the Americans decide, 'That one is too far,'\" Pantucci said. \"Or two boats bump into each other, or something happens with Taiwan.\"\n\nWhile such scenarios are worrying, Pantucci said they're not quite the precursor to the all-out combat imagined by more hawkish types.\n\n\"Are we going to see a conflict soon, like Steve Bannon's doomsday proclamation? I tend to be a little less apocalyptic than that. I tend to think that cooler heads will eventually prevail,\" Pantucci added.\n\nOne thing to remember, according to experts, is that China is not Russia.\n\nRussia has a relatively small economy and is less powerful than it was 30 years ago. It punches above its weight by sowing chaos and using hard power in places like Syria, Ukraine and Georgia, not to mention the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\n\"That is not China's game; China's game is to become the world's biggest power,\" Pantucci said. \"It doesn't want a nuclear war, because nuclear war is not conducive to growth.\"\n\nThose seeking reassurance can also look to the trade war that is starting to bite on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nShare markets soared Friday after a phone call between Trump and Xi resulted in a positive tweet from the American president.\n\nJust had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade. Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina. Also had good discussion on North Korea! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2018\n\nNevertheless, the damage is starting to show. Eighty-five percent of U.S. companies and 70 percent of Chinese companies surveyed said they had suffered from the tariffs, Reuters reported, citing a poll by the American Chamber of Commerce in South China.\n\nThe mutual pain would be even greater were a military conflict to break out, according to Gregory B. Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for International and Strategic Studies\n\nThe United States and China \"have a couple things going for them that no other two great powers ever have,\" he said.\n\n\"They are economically intertwined in a way that raises the costs of conflict for both,\" he added, \"and they are operating in an international web of institutions and norms that help blunt their worst impulses and offer avenues for peaceful contestation.\"\n\nMost Americans don't seem too bothered. In a poll in October by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, fewer than 4 in 10 people said the development of China was a critical threat to U.S. interests.\n\nPoling recognized that the South China Sea and Taiwan were \"potential triggers\" for a conflict, but for now, will he be losing sleep over it?\n\n\"Not tonight, no,\" he said.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 4, 2018, 5:30 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated when the Trump administration approved the sale of $330 million of F-16 parts to Taiwan.

Brynjar Gunnarsson / for NBC News\n\nBoys and girls are separated for most of the day and they actively compensate for their gender by practicing behaviors usually associated with the other sex: from being daring and taking the initiative to helpfulness and being considerate of others.\n\n\u201cThe best way to get closer to equality is to admit the differences,\u201d \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir said.\n\nAccording to the Hjalli theory, by keeping the sexes apart, boys and girls are free to develop their personalities and discover their interests without the pressures and constraints of conventional gender roles and stereotypes. The toys at the schools are all gender-neutral and all of the children wear identical uniforms.\n\n\u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir, 60, believes that if children practice only the stereotypical gendered behaviors as society encourages, they risk slipping into what she calls the \"blue\" and \"pink haze.\"\n\nFound at the two poles of the gender spectrum, this is where the natural strengths of each gender tip over into weaknesses, she explained.\n\nAccording to \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir, girls' sensitivity and caring natures can turn into self-pity and victimhood, while boys' strength and power can become aggression or even violence.\n\nMargr\u00e9t P\u00e1la \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir is the founder of the Hjalli model.

The girls don\u2019t need to practice this,\u201d explained Cardew, who said she does structured gender compensation work in class about once a week depending on how much she deems it\u2019s needed.\n\nThe teachers aim to strengthen boys' empathy and caring natures. Meanwhile, the girls are taught to strengthen their courage and self-confidence by running barefoot in the snow without screaming or being direct about how they feel.\n\n\u201cThe first variable in life is gender,\u201d said \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir, explaining that children often look to the other sex as an example of what not to do \u2014 a concept she referred to as \u201creverse mirroring.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you only have girls, there is nothing girly anymore, it\u2019s like the gender stereotype goes away,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, boys are no longer regarded as \u201cgirly\u201d or \"sissy\" if they show an interest in stereotypically female activities.\n\nBut while some of the new behavior may come naturally, \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir cautioned that it had to be reinforced through gender compensation work \u2014 from learning to care for younger children to learning to help yourself.\n\n\u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir believes that girls are more socially capable, have a stronger \"we\" identity and seemingly have a natural desire to be caring and helpful.\n\nGirls playing outside at the Laufasborg kindergarten in Reykjavik, Iceland.

Scott Miller took over the war in Afghanistan on Sept. 2, Afghan soldiers were being killed and wounded at near record numbers.\n\nHe instituted a more aggressive policy of helping the Afghan military track and defeat the Taliban \u2014 what he calls \"regaining the tactical initiative\" \u2014 but in an exclusive interview with NBC News on Tuesday, his first since taking command of U.S. and coalition forces here, he also says he recognizes that the solution in Afghanistan will be political, not military.\n\n\"This is not going to be won militarily,\" Miller said. \"This is going to a political solution.\"\n\n\"My assessment is the Taliban also realizes they cannot win militarily. So if you realize you can't win militarily at some point, fighting is just, people start asking why. So you do not necessarily wait us out, but I think now is the time to start working through the political piece of this conflict.\"\n\nSpeaking from the Resolute Support headquarters building in Kabul, Miller said he knew early on that he needed to turn the tables on the Taliban and go after them.\n\n\"We are more in an offensive mindset and don't wait for the Taliban to come and hit [us],\" he said. \"So that was an adjustment that we made early on. We needed to because of the amount of casualties that were being absorbed.\"\n\nGen. Scott Miller Massoud Hossaini / AP\n\nAfghan Security Forces suffered 1,000 casualties in August and September, according to the Pentagon.\n\nMiller has eliminated layers of approval for the troops advising the Afghans, giving them the authority to make decisions and move quickly around the battlefield as the need arises, and moving troops and equipment to areas where they can advise and empower the Afghan military and police in their fight against the Taliban.\n\nThese expeditionary advisory teams are intended to move to areas where they can join up with reliable partners, specific Afghan forces who the U.S. and NATO leaders are confident have stronger capabilities and can take on the Taliban. The U.S. advisers can bring overhead surveillance, fire support, and medevac capabilities with them.\n\n\"None of this is risk free,\" Miller said. Consolidating Afghan forces to go on the offensive is dangerous. \"They take casualties, but the casualties are much less when they're moving against the Taliban.\"\n\nIn 2018, Afghanistan's capital Kabul has had 19 high-profile suicide attacks, Miller said. He added that ISIS Khorasan, or ISIS-K, the Afghan affiliate of the terror group, has also been attacking and has \"resonance\" in urban areas.\n\n\"ISIS-K, they're dangerous. They have external aspirations, they have different capabilities, and they are connected outside of Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nMiller said ISIS-K fighters are more educated and are trying to set up their own state in Afghanistan. \"That's part of the playbook is to build up those administrative functions.\"\n\nMemos taken from an ISIS-K fighter offer a glimpse into some of those efforts. A U.S. official showed NBC News official ISIS-K documents with letterhead reading \"Islamic State of Khorasan.\" One memo even lays out \"budgetary considerations\" as part of ISIS-K operations.\n\nWhile ISIS-K is primarily in southern Nangahar and Kunar provinces, Miller said the group is trying to grow.\n\n\"Al Qaeda is the other group that we look at very closely,\" he said. \"They are down but not out, and again it goes back to not just what's happening here in Afghanistan, but what's happening external to Afghanistan as they build their external networks.\"\n\nMiller believes that without stability in Afghanistan, terror groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda will attack U.S. and allies outside the region.\n\n\"I try to simplify to everyone here what this is all about, it\u2019s about protecting the citizens of your [own] country,\" he said, referring to the NATO nations participating in the mission here.\n\n'I don't want to be Pollyannaish about this'\n\nMiller said he does not feel pressure from Washington to show results.\n\n\"I naturally feel compelled to try to set the conditions for a political outcome. So, pressure from that standpoint, yes. I don't want everyone to think this is forever.\"\n\nHaving led the war for about eight weeks now, Miller said one thing he wasn't expecting when he took over was the number of Taliban fighters laying down their arms to talk about a possible settlement.\n\nMiller says he is a realist on the issue of possible reconciliation with the Taliban. \"I don't want to be Pollyannaish about this,\" he said. Miller says he is pragmatic about a possible settlement.\n\n\"I see paths, some of them are risk filled,\" Miller said. \"So rather than optimistic, I say pragmatic.\"\n\nStill, Miller hopes to one day leave Afghanistan a better place than it is today.\n\n\"This is my last assignment as a soldier in Afghanistan. I don't think they'll send me back here in another grade. When I leave this time I'd like to see peace and some level of unity as we go forward.\" Miller said peace here \"makes it much easier to safeguard our vital national interests in the region.\"\n\nDuring his previous tours in Afghanistan, Miller got to know Afghan Gen. Abdul Raziq, a powerful Afghan police leader. Two weeks ago, Miller was near Raziq when one of his bodyguards opened fire on a group of Afghan and U.S. military leaders in the governor's compound in Kandahar, killing Raziq. Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Smiley, the U.S. general who oversees the NATO advisory mission in southern Afghanistan, and an unidentified civilian were also wounded.\n\nMiller doesn't believe he was a target. \"I was not on the gun line,\" he said. \"If it had gone on would the rest of us become part of the gunline? That's possible.\"\n\nMiller called Razik \"a friend and a partner\" and \"somebody I knew very well.\" But, once again, Miller saw the attack through a lens of pragmatism.\n\n\"He knew he was at risk. We all know we're at risk. It's Afghanistan.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pope-francis-can-solve-35-year-mystery-missing-emanuela-orlandi-n929671", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

A murder investigation has also been launched.\n\nThe ANSA news agency reported that prosecutors were focusing on whether the remains could be linked either to Orlandi, who disappeared on June 22, 1983, or another 15-year-old girl, Mirella Gregori, who went missing a month earlier in Rome, on May 7, 1983.\n\nPietro Orlandi said the possibility of the bones being his sister was \u201cpainful\u201d because he maintains she could be alive unless a body is found.\n\n\u201cIf Emanuela\u2019s bones really were found here at the Vatican Embassy, the truth needs to come out after 35 years of silence and cover-ups,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cClearly these 35 years weighed heavily on the Vatican\u2019s image, because there must be something unspeakable in this story.\u201d\n\nPietro Orlandi.

A Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.\n\nThe fighting has left 6,800 civilians dead and more than 10,000 injured, sparking the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

Freshwater species have also significantly fallen \u2014 down 83 percent in that period.\n\nThe Living Planet Index, provided by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and included in the WWF Living Planet 2018 report, tracked the population of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians around the world between 1970 and 2014, the latest year for which data was available.\n\nOther examples of wildlife populations that have dropped include:\n\nThe hedgehog, which has declined 75 percent between 2002 and 2014 in urban areas in the U.K.\n\nThe grey partridge, which has fallen by 85 percent between 1970 and 2004.\n\nThe African grey parrot population in southwest Ghana, which has decreased by 98 percent between 1992 and 2014.\n\nAdditionally, since 1950, almost 6 billion tons of fish and invertebrates have been taken from the oceans.\n\n\u201cThere cannot be a healthy, happy and prosperous future for people on a planet with a destabilized climate, depleted oceans and rivers, degraded land and empty forests, all stripped of biodiversity, the web of life that sustains us all,\u201d WWF Director General Marco Lambertin wrote in the report, which included contributions from more than 50 experts from around the world.\n\nThe report highlighted how humans have negatively affected the general health of the planet.

Many have been confined for seemingly inoffensive activities, including:\n\nAbstaining from alcohol and cigarettes. Having too many children. Owning a tent or a compass. Refusing to let officials take a retinal scan or a DNA sample. Giving a deceased relative a traditional Muslim burial instead of cremation. Traveling abroad, or just having spoken with someone who has.\n\n\u201cStraight out of George Orwell\u201d is how outgoing U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley described the persecution of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang by a government dominated by the ethnic Chinese, or Han, majority.\n\nSocial control is aided by facial-recognition software. Local ethnic Uighur Muslims making the traditional Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, must wear government-issued electronic monitoring devices.\n\nYet much of the coercion remains face-to-face, relying on \u201can erosion of social trust,\u201d according to James Leibold, an expert on China\u2019s policies on minorities at La Trobe University in Australia. \u201cHusbands don\u2019t trust wives, Han Chinese don\u2019t trust Uighurs, brothers don\u2019t trust sisters.\n\n\u201cIs Orwell the best metaphor?\" Leibold asked. \"Maybe Franz Kafka\u2019s \u2018The Trial\u2019 is a better one, where someone is detained but he doesn\u2019t know why, or what might happen to him.\u201d\n\nNew approach\n\nFor decades, Western criticism of Beijing\u2019s oppressiverule in Xinjiang met with stony silence or denials.\n\nRecently, that changed. On Oct. 16,the governor ofXinjiang, Shohrat Zakir, delivered the most detailed justification to date for the re-education camps, describing inmates as \u201cstudents\u201d in Xinjiang\u2019s \u201cvocational education and training program.\u201d\n\nRazor wire protects a cluster of schools on the outskirts of Kashgar, in western China's Xinjiang. Ng Han Guan / AP file\n\nAccording to Zakir, camp inmates live in air-conditioned dorms under \u201chumane\u201d conditions. They watch movies. They acquire job skills to become tailors, e-commerce traders and hairdressers.\n\nZakir\u2019s statement, reported at length by China\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency, reflected a new approach by Beijing: an all-out propaganda campaign to legitimize its practices in the region.\n\nUp to 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims are held in Xinjiang\u2019s camps, according to a U.N. report released in August. Until recently, however, Chinese authorities rarely acknowledged that the extra-judicial facilities even existed.\n\nOfficials have long ruled this Central Asian outpost with a heavy hand, viewing it as an incubator for terrorism and separatism, \u201cbut originally [they] tried to do it by stealth,\u201d Leibold said.\n\nThen, on Aug. 13, officials were stunned and embarrassed when international criticism erupted at a meeting of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Gay McDougall, the committee\u2019s special rapporteur for China, called Xinjiang \u201ca massive internment camp shrouded in secrecy, a no-rights zone.\"\n\nAt the meeting, China rejected the allegations.\n\nAnd now, Beijing is pushing back. Government apparatchiks seem suddenly to be everywhere, spreading Beijing\u2019s side of the story.\n\nThe unusually descriptive comments by Zakir \u2014 himself a Uighur \u2014 were a bid to help legitimize the camps. State-run television broadcast prime-time video of Uighur students reading a lesson titled: \u201cI am a law-abiding citizen.\u201d\n\nGlobal Times, a pro-government daily newspaper that often publishes nationalistic viewpoints, praised the \u201cvocational training centers, where people who are brainwashed by extreme thoughts and have committed misdemeanors\u201d are taught the Chinese language, laws and job skills.\n\nA demonstrator in Istanbul denounces China's treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims. Ozan Kose / AFP - Getty Images\n\nOther officials tried to dilute Muslims\u2019 strict adherence to the \u201chalal\u201d foods permitted under Islam. Senior prosecutor Ilshat Osman, also a Uighur, published a commentary titled: \u201cFriend, you do not have to find a halal restaurant especially for me.\u201d\n\n'Existential anxiety'\n\nWhy the urgency behind this narrative? It is too simple to assume Beijing sees President Donald Trump as abandoning longstanding American pressure in support of human rights and freedom of the press. And Chinese policymakers in recent years could not have missed the fact that brutal autocrats were on a roll, from Moscow to Manila, from Ankara to Riyadh.\n\nChinese leaders are driven by domestic politics. Experts say the ruling Communist Party fears internal challenges similar to the centrifugal forces \u2014 including ethnic fissures \u2014 that once tore apart the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. While Leibold believes China \u201cis not likely to unravel at the ethnic seams as the U.S.S.R. did,\u201d he said the possibility feeds \u201cBeijing\u2019s existential anxiety.\u201d\n\nAnother reason is Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s obsession with control. Compared to his predecessors, Xi moved unusually fast to consolidate power. He appointed himself head of numerous \u201csmall leading groups\u201d in government. He promoted loyal military officers. He pursued a ruthless anti-corruption drive that conveniently toppled key rivals.\n\nRichard McGregor, senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and author of a book on China\u2019s leaders, added that \u201cofficials on the ground tend to implement with zealotry what they think are Xi\u2019s policies, preferring to exceed their mandate rather than risk falling short.\u201d\n\nMen congregate outside a mosque in the old city in Kashgar, Xinjiang. Adam Dean / Redux Pictures file\n\nOfficials are also eyeing the countdown to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. When the capital last hosted the Games, the 2008 Summer Olympics, ethnic unrest exploded in Tibet, another minority area. Authorities scrambled to avert a PR disaster.\n\nWith the 2022 event looming, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., this month condemned the Xinjiang crackdowns and urged the International Olympic Committee to review China\u2019s hosting of the games. He also proposed that an imprisoned Uighur academic, Ilham Tohti, be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n'A convenient cudgel to whack China'\n\nParadoxically, the high-tech nature of China\u2019s surveillance system may be fueling paranoia at the top. Maochun Yu, a professor of East Asia and military history at the U.S. Naval Academy, described Xinjiang\u2019s domestic intelligence network as a \u201cdraconian high-tech, all-weather, round-the-clock total electronic surveillance dragnet.\u201d\n\nAcross a population of more than 1.3 billion, China\u2019s nationwide monitoring systems must be detecting countless embryonic threats. The effect on Chinese officials could be \u201cnot to reassure them, but in fact to freak them out,\u201d says Lowy\u2019s McGregor.\n\nIt might explain why Xinjiang\u2019s camps appear designed to nip \u201cpre-criminal\u201d tendencies in the bud. While prisons are for convicted criminals, these \u201cde-radicalization facilities\u201d try to indoctrinate wayward but unconvicted Muslims into ethnic Chinese society. Omurbek Eli, an ethnic Uighur, told Radio Free Asia that he learned Mandarin Chinese, sang patriotic songs, studied Communist Party laws and regulations, and took weekly exams.\n\n\u201cSleeping hours were from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. In the morning, all beds had to be made in military style,\u201d Eli recalled. \u201cIf one failed to do so, it was considered an ideological failure.\"\n\n\u201cInstructors informed you of trials and sentences, and what offenses they were related to. This was to create fear,\" he said. \"I now suffer from post-traumatic disorder and can no longer sleep properly.\u201d\n\nCan this sort of indoctrination \u2014 and the new strategy to legitimize it \u2014 work? One risk for Beijing is that harsh treatment to Sinicize ethnic Uighurs could fuel the anti-government sentiment that it is intended to suppress. And now that Xinjiang is being talked about more, it may become the thin end of a wedge prying Washington and Beijing further apart \u2014 something China\u2019s critics would welcome.\n\n\u201cXinjiang is an important wedge issue, which is ironic given some U.S. policies toward the Muslim world,\u201d Leibold said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the re-emergence of human rights as a China issue. Xinjiang is a convenient cudgel to whack China over the head with.\u201d\n\nWithin the Trump administration, critics of China are on the ascent, agrees McGregor, while those who supported engagement with Beijing \"are very isolated right now.\u201d\n\nFor Chinese authorities, however, maintaining control at home is always more important than winning friends overseas."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/german-chancellor-angel-merkel-will-not-run-again-leader-n925521", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The deal was designed to keep ground-based nuclear missiles out of Europe.\n\nTrump said that Russia has for years been violating the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF.\n\nHe's not the first president to make this allegation. President Barack Obama accused Russia of the same.\n\nMany experts agree that Moscow continues to break the rules and flout the pact, but despite that some say ripping up the agreement is a bad idea.\n\nSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, left, and U.S. President Ronald Reagan exchange pens during the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signing ceremony at the White House on Dec. 8, 1987. Gorbachev's translator, Pavel Palazhchenko, stands in the middle. Bob Daugherty / AP\n\nThese skeptics range from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to Gorbachev himself, with the Nobel laureate telling Russia's Interfax news agency Sunday that Trump's decision was \"very strange\" and not the work of \"a great mind.\"\n\nThe White House's decision to pull out, so this argument goes, will only allow Moscow to continue its current actions without having to maintain the pretense of compliance. Meanwhile, Russia, which also accuses the U.S. of violating the agreement, can point the finger at the U.S. as the one responsible for the INF's failure.\n\nThe 1987 agreement bans ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles that can strike between 300 to 3,400 miles.\n\n\"One concern is that in the medium-term there may be the temptation to return intermediate-range missiles, potentially including nuclear weapons, to Europe,\" said Karl Dewey, an analyst at Jane's by IHS Markit, an open-source defense intelligence provider based in London.\n\nAll this comes at a time when Trump's mixed messages have caused alarm among NATO allies about whether the president would truly commit to the principle of mutual defense if Europe were attacked.\n\n\"Accompanying any return of nuclear weapons will be the lingering concerns ... whether the U.S. would be prepared to protect its European allies in a nuclear war in the European theater \u2014 i.e. trade Boston for Berlin, Wisconsin for Warsaw,\" Dewey added.\n\nNot only do these critics say Trump's decision may have dangerous consequences, many were baffled at the rationale and timing of the move.\n\n\"Trump's reasoning is simply: Russia is cheating, so we're leaving the deal,\" Joshua H. Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, wrote on Twitter. \"That does fix the problem: Russia will follow suit and then no longer be cheating as they ramp up long-range cruise missile deployments.\"\n\n\"How does that advance U.S. interests, you ask?\" he added. \"Your guess, dear reader, is as good as mine.\"\n\nOne explanation might be that Trump is threatening Russia with an arms race it cannot afford in the hope that the prospect of being outgunned and outspent will force it back to the negotiating table.\n\nTom\u00e1\u0161 Val\u00e1\u0161ek, director of Carnegie Europe, said there are two broad possible outcomes of Trump's decision. One is the dangerous escalation that others have cautioned against. The other is possibility that Russia \u2014 sensing an expensive tit-for-tat arms build-up with the U.S. and NATO \u2014 will re-enter talks.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to put a relative weight to which scenario is more likely: unrestrained competition, or the threat of unrestrained competition leading to a new round of arms control,\" he said.\n\n\"You could make the case that it's better for the United States to say: good, if you're not going to abide by the treaty let's drop the pretense,\" he added. \"Let's imagine that we both get into an all-out arms race ... you, Russia, in this particular case will lose, because you don't have the budget or the technical means to compete with the United States.\"\n\nAnother potential explanation for Trump's move is that it will free up the U.S. to explore deploying intermediate, ground-based nuclear weapons in Asia. China is not constrained by the INF so at the moment it is able to deploy weapons that the U.S. is not.\n\nHowever, it is unclear where and how these weapons might be based. Dewey said that \"Washington will still encounter problems with deploying them [in Asia] if they are politically unpopular.\"\n\nOne place the U.S. might find particular resistance is if it tried to base nuclear weapons in Japan, the only country to experience their power in war, leading it to adopt a pacifist constitution."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/inside-remote-u-s-base-syria-central-combating-isis-countering-n922991", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But with the Islamic State in decline and on the run, the base is now playing a critical role in the American effort to diminish Iran's influence in the region.\n\nNBC News joined Army Gen. Joseph Votel, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, on a trip to Al Tanf where he acknowledged the base's strategic importance in countering the sway of Iran.\n\n\"We don't have a counter Iranian mission here. We have a defeat ISIS mission,\" Votel said Monday. \"But I do recognize that our presence, our development of partners and relationships down here does have an indirect effect on some malign activities that Iran and their various proxies and surrogates would like to pursue down here.\"\n\nUS General Joseph Votel speaks at al-Tanf base along the border with Jordan and Iraq. NBC News\n\nThe American forces use the remote outpost to train Syrian opposition fighters known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT, formerly the Free Syrian Army.\n\nThe MaT has roughly 300 soldiers working out of Al Tanf, conducting patrols in the region outside the base's walls as part of the effort to drive out ISIS. The territory is home to roughly 100,000 people including Bedouins and refugees living in the Rukban camp.\n\nThe base is located along a critical road that stretches from Tehran to Baghdad to Damascus. Known as the Baghdad Damascus Highway, it was once a busy thoroughfare for smugglers transporting both legal and illegal goods, including weapons.\n\nThe area that now houses the base sustained major damage when it was under Islamic State control.\n\nBut since 2015, the base has served as a key outpost in the fight against ISIS. U.S. forces, with the aid of Syrian opposition fighters, have driven ISIS out of an area that stretches roughly 35 miles from the Jordanian border in what is known as a \"deconfliction zone.\"\n\n\"What we've been able to do is ensure that this area, the deconfliction zone that we have around Al Tanf, does not support freedom of movement for ISIS,\" Votel said.\n\n\"They're not safe here. They can't operate here. Undoubtedly some elements try to pass through here and I think we have been very successful at interdicting them.\"\n\nAl Tanf's location is also central to its role in preventing the Iranians from gaining a firmer foothold in the region.\n\nThe base sits in the heart of what Iran hopes will be part of a \"Shia Crescent,\" a continuous land bridge linking Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon.\n\nA military helicopter at al-Tanf base along the border with Jordan and Iraq NBC News\n\nAs NBC News reported earlier this month, the Trump administration has been developing a new strategy in Syria that would focus more heavily on pushing Iran's military and its proxy forces out of the country.

Most of Israel\u2019s 250,000 Bedouin citizens, who historically are tribal nomadic Muslim Arabs, live in the Negev desert.\n\nThe day they moved back there to her husband\u2019s village, Yusra recalls: \u201cChildren I\u2019d never seen or heard of before started running up to him screaming, \u2018Daddy, Daddy!\u2019\u201d He then introduced Yusra to his other wife, who lived next door. \u201cMy heart was bleeding.\u201d\n\nStill, Yusra adored her husband. Many Bedouin men have multiple wives, she told herself. \u201cIt\u2019s our tradition.\" Plus, she was his newer, younger wife, so she got most of his attention.\n\nThen, after five children and 18 years together, her husband uttered the words that she said destroyed her. \u201cI\u2019m taking another wife,\u201d he said. \u201cI have needs as a man, and you\u2019re not meeting them.\u201d\n\nYusra begged him to reconsider. \u201cYou don\u2019t decide,\u201d he told her. He moved into a house next door with his 18-year-old bride, leaving her alone with their children, including a son with cerebral palsy.\n\n\u201cI was broken,\u201d says Yusra, 42, wearing a red head scarf that frames her eyes. She asked NBC News to use only her first name for fear of reprisals from her husband, who still lives next door.\n\nMona Al-Habnen sets-up for morning prayers in her mother's house in the Bedouin city of Rahat in the Negev desert on July 28. Federica Valabrega / Federica Valabrega\n\nThat was 2014, and Yusra thought she had no choice. What she didn\u2019t know is that polygamy has been illegal in Israel since 1977 and is punishable by up to five years in prison. Many Bedouin don\u2019t know that, because Israel has rarely enforced that law, seeing it as an internal ethnic issue.\n\nAccording to Israeli government data, at least 20 percent of Bedouin families are polygamous, but women\u2019s rights advocates estimate the figure is closer to 40 percent, and 60 percent among older men.\n\nEven a Bedouin member of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, has two wives. No Bedouin woman has ever held a political position in Israel, not even on the local level, though the combined Arab political parties have the third-largest party representation in the Knesset. Bedouin village councils are run exclusively by men, many of whom are polygamous. Though Bedouin women can legally drive, attend university, vote and work, they are often pressured by their families not to do anything more than what their husbands expect: stay home, cook, clean and raise children.\n\nBedouin men who marry multiple wives only register one marriage with Israeli authorities, making the problem difficult to track. Muslim marriages are carried out by Sharia courts, and multiple marriages by one man are rarely reported to authorities. Thus many married Bedouin women are legally considered single.\n\nAs a result, despite its traditionalism, the Bedouin community boasts Israel\u2019s highest rate of single mothers. Over 10 percent of Bedouin families are single-parent households.\n\nNow all of that is changing.\n\n84 recommendations spur action\n\nIn January 2017, the government passed an $825 million plan to improve the socio-economic status of the Bedouin sector, Israel\u2019s most disenfranchised population. Part of that plan was the creation of a government committee to eradicate polygamy and help the women and children who are hurt by it.\n\nThe head of this committee is Justice Ministry Director General Emi Palmor. She spent a year meeting with Bedouin women in southern Israel to develop the government\u2019s plan. In July she produced a 315-page report detailing 84 recommendations spanning law enforcement, education, health and welfare.\n\n\u201cPolygamy impacts every aspect of their lives,\u201d said Palmor, adding that women in polygamous marriages suffer high rates of sexual assault, domestic violence and depression. Bedouin men typically live with their newest wife, leaving their previous wife to fend for herself and their children. According to Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics, just 20 percent of Bedouin women work, so children of such marriages are born into a cycle of poverty. The Bedouin have Israel\u2019s highest rates of unemployment, poverty, and an average birth rate of six children, double that of the general population.\n\nThis month, cabinet ministers approved the committee\u2019s recommendations, which include anti-polygamy education, barring polygamous men from civil service and teaching jobs, and increasing law enforcement. The 84 recommendations are now being implemented across numerous ministries and drafted into laws. Israel\u2019s attorney general has issued 15 criminal indictments against polygamous men, and Sharia judges are cooperating to ensure more men are reported.\n\n\u201cThe impact is much more than 15 indictments,\u201d said Palmor. \u201cBedouin men are getting the message that polygamy is unacceptable. They need to take responsibility for their families.\u201d\n\nNow Bedouin women say it\u2019s about time Israel cracks down. Leading the way is Insaf Abu-Shareb, an outspoken feminist who defies the stereotypes of what a feminist is and what a Bedouin woman should be.\n\nSunset light hits the cemetery just outside Rahat, the biggest Bedouin city in Israel on July 19. Federica Valabrega / Federica Valabrega\n\nA Bedouin woman leading the way\n\nAs a girl, Abu-Shareb was told that her life mattered less than her brothers. Her mother was 15 when she married her father. One of 17 children, Abu-Shareb, 39, recalls how each time her mother had a boy, \u201cthere were celebrations. Friends and family came from all over the country to bless him.\u201d When she give birth to daughters, there were no celebrations. \u201cPeople told her they were sorry, and said Inshallah\u201d \u2014 with Allah\u2019s will \u2014 \u201cthe next one will be a boy,\u201d she said.\n\nAbu-Shareb went on to become one of the first Bedouin women to earn a law degree and is now a leading activist fighting for Bedouin women\u2019s rights. In over a decade of pro-bono work as an attorney, she found a common thread: Nearly every woman who sought her help was in a polygamous marriage. \u201cAll their problems went back to that,\u201d she said.\n\nIn one case, a 14-year-old girl was purchased from her family in the West Bank by a Bedouin man in his 50s. In another, a man turned a gun on his wife for opposing his marriage to another woman.\n\nUntil March, Abu-Shareb represented the Arab-Jewish nonprofit organization Itach-Ma'aki, Women Lawyers for Social Justice, fighting to raise awareness and filing petitions to the courts. When that failed, she turned to Arab lawmakers, who told her there were more pressing issues plaguing the Bedouin community, such as home demolitions and access to government services in unrecognized villages.\n\n\u201cFor years, nobody wanted to touch polygamy,\u201d said Abu-Shareb. It was thought of as \u201creligious freedom,\u201d she said in air quotes. Though the Koran permits a man to marry up to four wives, he\u2019s required to treat them equally. \u201cThat\u2019s far from what\u2019s happening in reality,\u201d she says.\n\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel, the government has been in a land dispute with the Bedouin community, which claims to own the land it lives on in the desert. The government has demolished thousands of their homes and villages on grounds of illegal construction. Abu-Shareb\u2019s childhood home was bulldozed when she was 10. Many Bedouin, including Abu-Shareb\u2019s own family, live in so-called unrecognized villages, without government services like running water, electricity and transportation.\n\nLawyer and activist Insaf Abu-Shareb, center, enjoys tea with her mother and sister in the house she grew-up in in Asder, an unrecognized Bedouin village in the Negev desert in Israel, on Aug. 9. Federica Valabrega\n\n\u201cThis is just another form of patriarchy,\u201d Abu-Shareb said of Arab lawmakers who told her that fighting polygamy was not a priority. \u201cThey act as if Bedouin women aren\u2019t strong enough or smart enough to know what\u2019s important to us. They believe they know better.\u201d\n\n'We can\u2019t afford not to be part of this conversation'\n\nIn 2015, Arab feminist Aida Touma-Sliman became head of the committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality \u2014 the first Arab lawmaker to lead any Knesset committee. Abu-Shareb thought her moment had finally come. She requested meetings and sent letters asking Touma-Sliman to combat polygamy.\n\n\u201cAll she had were excuses,\u201d said Abu-Shareb. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s sensitive,\u2019 she said, \u2018We have a polygamous member of Knesset in our party.\u2019 To hear a female Arab member of Knesset who claims to be a feminist ignore the needs of the Bedouin women she\u2019s supposed to represent, was really disappointing.\u201d\n\nAs a critic of Israeli policy toward the Bedouin community, Abu-Shareb tried to work with Arab lawmakers on the issue. But after she said her requests were repeatedly ignored, she turned to Israel\u2019s Justice Ministry, led by right-wing minister Ayelet Shaked. \u201cFrom my experience in trying to fight this for 10 years, we cannot do it alone,\u201d she said.\n\nAbu-Shareb presented officials with research she had conducted on the harm polygamy causes to Bedouin women and children. She brought Bedouin women\u2019s testimony to the Knesset for the first time in early 2017. Meanwhile, right-wing ministers raised concerns over the large numbers of women being brought into Israel from the Palestinian territories to marry Bedouin men.\n\nThough she worries the government is principally motivated by a desire to limit the Arab birth rate, Abu-Shareb joined the anti-polygamy committee as its only Bedouin woman. Her aim is to ensure that Bedouin women will be represented.\n\n\u201cFor decades the state did nothing. Now the moment the state is taking action we need to be there to ensure that these decisions will be good for Bedouin women,\u201d says Abu-Shareb. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to be part of this conversation.\u201d\n\nMany of those 84 recommendations came from Abu-Shareb herself, who advised Palmor, facilitated her meetings with Bedouin women, and is working with the government to implement its plans. \u201cWithout the perspective Insaf provided, there would be no report on polygamy, and no change to the situation,\u201d said Palmor.\n\nAbu-Shareb has been praised by Bedouin women and some men for her role in the government\u2019s fight against polygamy. Yet she faces criticism from Arab politicians and women\u2019s rights organizations, which have painted the government\u2019s anti-polygamy plan as a crusade to reduce the Arab birth rate. Insaf left her organization after its leader urged her to stop participating with the government.\n\n\u201cThey say I\u2019m playing into the hands of the right and their battle for demographics, and that this is against the Bedouin,\u201d said Abu-Shareb. \u201cI say, I\u2019m looking out for Bedouin women because nobody else is.\u201d\n\nSisters and nieces of Abu-Shareb get ready for prayer time in her mother's house in Asder, Israel, on Aug. 9. Federica Valabrega\n\nMona Al-Habnen, another Bedouin women\u2019s rights activist, said that despite her suspicions of the government\u2019s agenda, she supports the fight to end polygamy.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t just the state standing in our way.

But like the other participants in the Lofoten Masters \u2014 the northernmost surf competition in the world \u2014 he isn't here for comfort or warmth.\n\nHeld on a remote beach in Norway's Lofoten Islands, an archipelago 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, the competition is testament to the growing popularity of extreme cold-water surfing.\n\nRolf's older brother William looks on from the beach, his face partly hidden by the fur-lined hood of his thick brown parka. It will soon be his turn to brave the water.\n\nThe Lofoten Masters tournament \u2014 the world's only Arctic surf competition \u2014 draws daredevils from around the world, including U.S. brothers William and Rolf Hellem-Brusso. Dean Taylor\n\n\"This competition is all about trying to overcome the extremeness of the nature around you \u2014 the cold, the rain, the snow and the hail that come down \u2014 sometimes all at once,\" says William, 24.\n\n\"Surfing out here can be a spiritual experience: You're riding world-class waves in one of the most beautiful places on Earth.\"\n\nLofoten is best known for its craggy cliffs, snow-swept summits and barren beaches. This polar wilderness is the last place where you might expect to find a surfing competition, but the Lofoten Masters has been going strong since 2007.\n\nImprovements in wetsuit technology have opened up some of the world's coldest water to a growing number of surfers. Many are drawn by the thrill of adventuring to remote frontiers in search of new waves and smaller crowds.\n\n\"Back home, there might be 100 guys out fighting for a wave,\" says Rolf. \"Here you've got it all to yourself \u2014 no crowds to battle \u2014 just a fun time with friends.\"\n\nWhale stew\n\nUnstad \u2014 population: 14 \u2014 is an unlikely epicenter for the sport in Norway. Nestled in a rugged valley, the tiny hamlet is home to more sheep than people.\n\nRain brings a splash of color to the beach in the Lofoten islands, Norway. Dean Taylor\n\nBut its beaches boast consistent waves and the town has not one, but two surf shops.\n\nDaredevils from around the globe have been coming here to brave the freezing waters, drawn by the awe-inspiring beauty. Norway's midnight sun offers 24-hour surfing during the summer. In the winter, surfers are treated to nature's greatest light show: the aurora borealis.\n\nMarion Frantzen and her husband, Tommy Olsen, run Unstad Arctic Surf, which offers board rentals and surf lessons, a restaurant \u2014 whale stew is a popular menu item \u2014 and cabin accommodation.\n\nInside, it looks like a Hawaii surf shop. A mannequin clad in a grass skirt and a coconut bra decorates the dining room; Polynesian carvings line the walls; warm winter beanies are sold alongside Hawaiian hula dashboard dolls. A roaring fireplace warms the dining room, casting a soft glow over photographs of surfers trudging through snow or riding the chilly waters.\n\n\"Arctic surfing has gotten much more popular in recent years because people are drawn to the thrill of discovering new coastlines and having a totally different kind of surfing experience,\" Marion says.\n\nRolf and William Hellem-Brusso in the Lofoten Islands, Norway, which offer visitors the chance to surf in extreme conditions and where ocean temperatures can dip into the 30s. Dean Taylor\n\nMarion's father helped pioneer surfing in Norway. In 1963, fresh off a trip to Australia, where he saw surfing for the first time, he and a friend decided to make their own surfing board out of discarded refrigerator insulation foam. They modeled it on the white- and blue-striped board pictured on the cover of the Beach Boys' album \"Surfin' Safari.\" The board hangs inside the shop today.\n\n\"Arctic surfing sounds scarier than it is,\" Marion says. \"The wetsuits are thick and insulated, so you're very protected, but people don't realize that we actually get the Gulf Stream all the way from Mexico, which means ice-free beaches and surfing all winter.\"\n\nNew faces\n\nBack on the beach, the competition continues.\n\nThe judges sit inside a hut to protect themselves from the rapidly changing elements. The hail and rain are eventually replaced by sunshine and a double rainbow, which delights onlookers.\n\nThe Gulf Stream means the water isn't as cold as it looks. Dean Taylor\n\nStaying warm on shore is a struggle despite the protection of winter parkas, hats and gloves. Some hop from foot to foot while chatting, their eyes fixed on the ocean, watching competitors ride the wintry waves.\n\nRolf and William have been coming to Unstad for over a decade and say they see more and more new faces every year. But are they worried about their tranquil surf spot's blowing up?\n\n\"A little,\" says Rolf. \"But the cool thing about stoke\" \u2014 surfing thrill \u2014 \"is sharing it with others, so I'm happy to share this beautiful place with anybody.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/president-trump-s-risky-bet-saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-n922091", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Trump, however, has cultivated Saudi Arabia to an unprecedented degree, blessing the 33-year-old crown prince\u2019s ascent in the royal family and his crackdown on opponents and rivals, former U.S. officials and Western diplomats said.\n\n\u201cEvery American president since FDR has courted the Saudis, but none of them have done it as avidly and crudely as Donald Trump,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer who served in the spy agency for 30 years.\n\nIn his first trip abroad as president last year, Trump made the unusual choice to travel to Riyadh, where he took part in a traditional all-male dance with the Saudi royals, swaying back and forth with a ceremonial sword in hand.\n\n\"That was a tremendous day. Tremendous investments into the United States, and our military community is very happy,\" Trump tweeted after his first day of meetings. The Saudis projected his words on large digital displays. Trump referred to the trip again on Friday in his reaction to the Saudi admission of involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nWhite House senior adviser Jared Kushner at the Royal Court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 20, 2017. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters file\n\nBut the vast arms sales and investments promised haven't yet materialized. The Saudis are still haggling with the U.S. about the cost of buying the THAAD ballistic missile defense system. Instead of the $110 billion in arms sales initially touted by Trump, now the administration says only about $14 billion worth of weapons have been implemented with signed letters \u2014 and many of those originated under the previous administration.\n\nThe State Department was largely shut out of the planning for the president\u2019s trip to Riyadh, and instead the task was entrusted to Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president. The young real estate businessman with no diplomatic experience reportedly came away impressed by the crown prince, as they were two thirty-somethings anointed by powerful families with shared agendas\n\nInside Saudi Arabia, the crown prince is sometimes derisively referred to as \u201cMohammed bin Kushner,\u201d said Riedel, who wrote a book on the U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\nDriving the courtship was the crown prince\u2019s fixation on combating Iran.\n\nMohammed bin Salman, or MBS, \u201cis viscerally anti-Iran,\u201d said former CIA director John Brennan, now an NBC News analyst. \u201cHe strongly opposed the Iranian nuclear agreement, and he found partners in the Trump White House with little understanding of the complexities of the Middle East eager to scuttle it.\u201d\n\nWeeks after the president\u2019s visit to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies imposed a blockade on Qatar, accusing it of funding Muslim Brotherhood militants and backing Shiite-ruled Iran. It was another bold and controversial move by the Crown Prince that alarmed Western governments, but Trump gave it his endorsement.\n\n\u201cDuring my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar \u2014 look!\u201d the president tweeted on June 6, a day after the blockade was announced.\n\nDuring my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017\n\nThe same month, the Trump administration reversed a suspension by President Barack Obama of the sale of precision-guided bombs to the Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen. Obama had objected to civilian casualties. Congress narrowly approved, along partisan lines, a resumption of the weapons deliveries, despite repeated reports from human rights groups that the Saudis were using the bombs to hit civilian targets.\n\n\u201cThe decision to end the prohibition on the sale of precision weapons to Saudi was a big early signal that he was going to be in MBS\u2019 corner \u2026 and dismiss all that nitpicking about human rights issues,\u201d said William Hartung, the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, a left-of-center think tank.\n\nThe crown prince had impressed Trump administration officials as well as other Westerners with talk of opening up the Saudi economy, undercutting hardline Islamist ideologues and cracking down on corruption. But his iron-fisted methods raised concerns in and outside the country. A pivotal moment came in November 2017, when he rounded up and temporarily detained hundreds of the country\u2019s most powerful figures, including members of the royal family. Some were confined at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh, and some were tortured.\n\nThe round-up stunned and infuriated many inside the House of Saud, but Trump gave MBS a big thumbs up.\n\n\u201cI have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing...\u201d he tweeted. \u201c....Some of those they are harshly treating have been \u201cmilking\u201d their country for years!\u201d\n\nI have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2017\n\n....Some of those they are harshly treating have been \u201cmilking\u201d their country for years! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2017\n\nPrior to the crown prince\u2019s rise, successive administrations had forged close ties to Mohammed bin Nayef, a nephew of the king who won the trust of U.S. intelligence agencies for his cooperation on counterterrorism efforts during his time as minister of interior. He had been seen as the heir to the throne, until Mohammed bin Salman won favor with the king, his father, and pushed Mohammed bin Nayef aside last year.\n\n\"MBN did not go willingly. MBS reportedly cleared his removal with Washington, whether that was the White House or CIA. He wanted to make sure there were no repercussions for the relationship,\" Brennan told NBC News.\n\nAsked if the administration weighed in on the rivalry, a State Department official, who asked not to be identified because was not authorized to speak on the record, told NBC News, \u201cSuccession is an internal matter for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nOther former officials said the demotion of Mohammed bin Nayef was an ominous sign. \u201cLetting Mohammed bin Salman push out Mohammed bin Nayef is the original sin of this relationship,\u201d said Ali Soufan, a former FBI official who has written extensively about counterterrorism in the Middle East. \u201cMohammed bin Nayef was the most important counterterrorism official in the Middle East [and] had worked with the U.S. for decades.\u201d\n\nThe president and his aides believed President Obama had abandoned Arab allies and that the crown prince would be a crucial partner in rolling back Iran\u2019s influence in the region. They were willing to suspend judgment when it came to MBS\u2019s excesses, officials said, even as criticism mounted around the globe.\n\nBut the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince who had longstanding ties to the Saudi royal family, has placed Trump\u2019s relations with the crown prince under unprecedented scrutiny.\n\nTurkish officials have alleged Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a Saudi hit team, reportedly with links to the crown prince. On Friday, Saudi Arabia put out a statement claiming its agents choked Khashoggi to death after a fistfight. Riyadh said 18 officials had been arrested but the crown prince was not one of them. Instead, Mohammed bin Salman was empowered to reorganize the intelligence service in yet another promotion.\n\nDespite international outrage, Trump remains reluctant to break with the crown prince who he has worked so hard to cultivate, even as lawmakers from both parties dismissed Saudi Arabia\u2019s account as a whitewash.\n\n\u201cThe brutality of it, the sheer nastiness grabbed people. People knew Jamal. It\u2019s personal,\u201d said Gerald Feierstein, a former senior U.S. diplomat who served as ambassador to Yemen and other posts. The crown prince\u2019s abuses now were \u201cno longer abstract.\u201d\n\nTrump and his team pinned their hopes on an impetuous and reckless crown prince, he said, partly out of a yearning to make a break with the previous president\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cSo why did the administration fall for it? Ignorance, na\u00efvet\u00e9 by Trump and Kushner, lack of experience and being taken in by Saudi promises,\u201d Feierstein said. \u201cAlso, there was the desire to reverse Obama\u2019s policies. They believed Obama sucked up to Iran, so they would suck up to Saudis.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/brexit-just-six-months-away-neither-backers-nor-foes-are-n912436", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Loay Abu Haykel / Reuters file\n\n\u201cIt is tragic comedy. When I saw the leader of the free world say, \u2018If my son-in-law cannot solve the Israel-Palestinian problem, nobody can do that,\u2019 I didn\u2019t know whether to cry or to laugh,\u201d Beilin added, referring to Jared Kushner who is in charge of efforts to craft a long-awaited plan.\n\nBeilin spent decades negotiating with Palestinians, who have boycotted Washington's recent efforts, and was in London discussing the possibility of a confederation between Israel and a future Palestinian state.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he was confident his Mideast peace plan would be presented in the next two-to-four months.\n\nDespite Trump's comments, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday said the White House's decision to recognize Jerusalem \u2014 which Palestinians see as their own capital \u2014 as the capital of Israel, and aid cuts to Palestinians, threatened plans for a future state.\n\n\"With all of these decisions, this administration has reneged on all previous U.S. commitments, and has undermined the two-state solution,\" Abbas said in his address at the U.N. General Assembly, an annual gathering of world leaders.\n\nYossi Mekelberg, a professor of international relations at Regent's University and senior consulting fellow at Chatham House think tank in London, called Trump\u2019s comments at the U.N. vague \"dinner table talk.\"\n\nHe said they were far from the concrete plans required from a \u201cpresident of country that is expected to broker the peace.\u201d\n\nTrump's decision last month to slash all U.S. funding for UNRWA \u2014 the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees which the administration calls \u201cirredeemably flawed\u201d \u2014 and programs aimed at promoting coexistence, further alienated some Israelis and many Palestinians.\n\nAs hope for a practical and just resolution to the conflict wanes, Mekelberg warned, the possibility of violence grows.\n\n\u201cEverything that [Trump] has done is to undermine the two-state solution either by ignorance or intent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Trump is doing together with the Israeli government could lead to bloodshed and the end of Israel as a democratic state.\u201d\n\nThe funding crisis at UNRWA, which provides schooling, health and food assistance to around 5 million refugees in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, is acute.\n\nAfter warning that it was just weeks away from ceasing operations, UNRWA got a reprieve with $118 million in new pledges this week at the U.N. General Assembly. However, this leaves a shortfall of $68 million in its annual budget.\n\nThe U.S. was previously UNRWA's single biggest donor country and the Trump administration shows no signs of going back on its decision.\n\nKey to the White House\u2019s criticism of UNRWA is the way it counts the descendants of refugees as refugees themselves.\n\nBy undermining the agency, the administration is attempting to remove a pervasive Palestinian belief in the right of return. The conviction that those who were driven from their homes when the state of Israel was established \u2014 and their descendants \u2014 should one day return to ancestral homes is a cardinal and unifying belief among Palestinians.\n\nConcerns for the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, the blockaded enclave run by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, are running especially high.\n\nOn Tuesday, the World Bank warned that the decade-long blockade and a \u201crecent drying up of liquidity\u201d because of aid cuts was pushing the economy into \u201cfree fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe result is an alarming situation with every second person living in poverty and the unemployment rate for its overwhelmingly young population at over 70 percent,\u201d the report said.\n\nOver the weekend, Abbas warned of potential violence in the Palestinian territories.\n\n\"The situation is very serious,\u201d President Abbas said in statements to Voice of Radio Israel.\n\nA Palestinian protester carries a boy as he runs from tear gas fired by Israeli soldiers during a protest in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip on Sept. 10.

Ebrahim Noroozi / AP\n\nWhat the attack does show, however, is that Iranian opponents of various stripes see this as a \"unique opportunity\" to further their cause, according to Sanam Vakil, an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins School of International Studies Europe.\n\n\"More people are recognizing that Iran is coming under increasing pressure,\" she said.\n\nThis pressure comes from a multitude of sources both abroad and at home.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken a much harder line on the Islamic republic, pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal signed under the Obama administration.\n\nIn July, Reuters reported that Trump wants to club together with Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, to create an \"Arab NATO\" to contain Iran.\n\nIran is already locked in a series of proxy conflicts with Saudi Arabia. The two regional powers \u2014 Iran is largely Shiite Muslim, while Saudi Arabia is predominantly Sunni Muslim \u2014 are vying for military and political influence in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.\n\nSome of these conflicts have involved Iranian-backed forces fighting against ISIS, something that has resulted in a certain amount of \"blowback\" at home, Vakil said.\n\nLast June, for example, ISIS claimed responsibility for twin attacks on Iran's parliament and the mausoleum of Islamic republic\u2019s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The extremist group also said it was behind Saturday's attack in Ahvaz.\n\nAdd to this pressure cooker a population that has been taking to the streets in defiance of their regime's strict control of political freedoms.\n\nAll of these destabilizing forces have created a perfect storm for opponents to exploit, according to Vakil, who is also a senior consulting research fellow at London's Chatham House think tank.\n\n\"This is a unique opportunity in Iran for people to try to take advantage of perceived Iranian weakness,\" she said.\n\nAnother opposition movement that claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack was an Arab separatist group called the Ahvaz National Resistance.\n\nThis movement seeks a separate state in Khuzestan, the oil-rich region where most of Iran's Arab minority live. Ahvaz, where Saturday's attack took place, is the regional capital.\n\nIranian soldiers run for cover during a terrorist attack that occurred during Saturday's military parade. Morteza Jaberian / EPA\n\nThis community has long felt neglected by the Persian-dominated central government in Tehran. They have been hit particularly hard by Iran's economic and unemployment problems, and they have suffered drought and electricity shortages.\n\nArmed opposition groups have played on this discontent to attempt to drum up support for their actions which have included attacks on oil pipelines in the region.\n\n\"Grievances caused by internal mismanagement and short-sightedness could be exploited by regional actors and exacerbated by global powers,\" said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group.\n\nIf militant groups are willing and able to carry out attacks it could be a sign that Iran is losing what has traditionally been an iron grip on domestic security.\n\nThe country is half democracy, half theocracy. Iran is classed as \"authoritarian\" and ranked 154th out of 167 countries in a global democracy index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit. It has largely been immune to the types of militant attacks that have torn through other countries in the region.\n\nSaturday's incident and others like it might be a sign this is changing.\n\n\"The attack demonstrates Iran's vulnerability to the same pathologies that have torn the region apart,\" Vaez added. \"Iran has been largely shielded from this plague so far. If that changes, regional turmoil will doubtless escalate further.\"\n\nThe father of Mohammad Taha Eghadami, a 4-year-old boy who was killed in Saturday's attack, mourns atop his coffin Monday. Ebrahim Noroozi / AP\n\nAnother possible outcome is Iran shifting further from its relatively moderate reformists to religious hardline nationalists.\n\nThe current president is Hassan Rouhani, who represents the moderates and oversaw the Iran nuclear deal being signed in 2015.\n\nSome analysts say that attacks like the one on Saturday boost support for the Revolutionary Guards. They had gained leverage after Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal, telling the Iranian public it was proof the U.S. could not be trusted.\n\nOn Monday, thousands packed the streets to mourn the victims of Saturday's assault, many chanting \"Death to Israel and America.\" Twelve members of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, were among the 25 people killed.\n\nThough he was vague, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei implied the culprits were backed by the U.S. and other Gulf states.\n\n\"Based on reports, this cowardly act was done by people who the Americans come to help when they are trapped in Syria and Iraq, and are paid by Saudi Arabia and the UAE,\" Khamenei said on his official website.\n\nNikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., pushed back, saying Iran should \"look in the mirror\" for the causes of the attack.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News on Monday, Rouhani condemned Haley's comments.\n\n\"Yesterday, one of the American officials clearly and openly supported these terrorists, and said that in Ahvaz if something took place, Iran must not seek the roots of that terrorist attack in other countries,\" he said. \"If this is indeed so, if this train of thought makes sense, how do we apply the same logic to the terrorist attacks of September 11?\"\n\nAlthough opponents of the regime might see opportunity in Iran's perceived weakness, that does not necessarily mean they will succeed.\n\n\"The majority of the IRGC are regular, often young, rank-and-file conscripts who most citizens will relate to and commiserate with,\" said Bilal Baloch, a non-resident fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of International Studies.\n\nHe said this might mean \"you actually end up with a rally-around-the-flag effect domestically. So the Iranian people are not likely to turn against the regime.\"\n\nVaez agreed. \"The Ahvaz attack ... could also play in the Iranian leaders' favor,\" he said. \"Propagating a siege mentality could help change the subject domestically, from complaints over mounting economic troubles to a nationalistic rallying around the flag.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/russia-tests-supersonic-anti-ship-oniks-missiles-in-arctic-1329766467679", "text": "Russia tests supersonic anti-ship Oniks missiles in Arctic 00:45 copied!\n\nRussia showcased its military might by test firing anti-ship Oniks missiles from a mobile defense system in the Arctic.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-tariffs-sanctions-offer-erdogan-excuse-turkey-s-economic-woes-n910736", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

And despite the stereotype that young people aren't interested in religion, one in four British Catholics aged 25 to 34 say they go to Mass weekly, compared with just one in five who are 45 to 64.\n\nThe ranks of Britain's young Catholic sisters include Theodora Hawksley, 33, who laughed about giving away some of her outfits when she joined the Congregation of Jesus in North London, as she felt they were \u201cprobably too slinky for a nun.\u201d\n\n\"I thought, 'Probably not going to use that again!'\" she recalled, referring to a sequined sleeveless top.\n\nHawksley never dons a habit.

Hawksley says her congregation doesn't have \"strict rules about what you wear.\"\n\nShe attributes some of the interest among young Brits in traditional Catholicism to the pressures of the digital age.\n\n\"Millennials themselves have grown up in a very permissive society in some ways, where you can do whatever you like, you can choose whatever you like, and I think feel a need for stronger identity and stronger boundaries,\" Hawksley said.\n\nHawksley and her religious sisters live somewhat differently from the stereotype of nuns: Apart from not dressing alike, members of the Congregation of Jesus don\u2019t take religious names \u2014 Hawksley just goes by Theo.

Otherwise the U.S. must bear the consequences.\"\n\nIt did not specify what these consequences might be.\n\nSo what's actually going on here?\n\nOn the surface this might seem like a simple tit-for-tat exchange between two world powers that have increasingly locked horns in recent months. The reality is more complicated.\n\nDespite China being named in the measures, \"the ultimate target of these sanctions is Russia,\" a senior Trump administration official said Thursday.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the sanctions were \"not intended to take down the economy of third-party countries\" such as China.\n\nThe punitive measures are intended to punish \"Russian malign acts,\" the official added.\n\nThese \"malign acts\" range from Russia's annexation of Crimea and its participation in the Ukrainian and Syrian wars, to its meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe U.S. thinking is pretty straightforward: By targeting countries that buy Russian weapons, the U.S. is trying to squeeze the money Moscow gets from selling arms: buy from them and you might also be blacklisted.\n\nThursday was the first time Washington has sanctioned anything or anyone for dealing with those blacklisted under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, known as CAATSA.\n\n\"This is a significant step,\" the administration official said.\n\nWith the same pen-stroke, the U.S. also blacklisted another 33 Russians who it said have been working for or on behalf of Russian defense or intelligence services. Some of these people were among those indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for allegedly meddling in the U.S. election.\n\nA message to Turkey?\n\nAll this is playing against a backdrop of changing relations between China and Russia.\n\nCooperation between these world powers appears to be growing, underscored by their joint participation in military exercises this month that were billed by Moscow as its biggest since the Cold War.\n\nCode-named \"Growler\" by NATO, the S-400 packs powerful radar and can hit aerial targets up to 250 miles away.

Among their targets have been powerful pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC, and the network of Jewish camps, Camp Ramah. They also protested when President Donald Trump\u2019s former adviser Steve Bannon spoke at the Zionist Organization of America, and organized a demonstration in Washington after the U.S. announced it was moving its embassy to Jerusalem, which infuriated Palestinians.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Sharon Brous of Los Angeles, a who leads a progressive non-denominational congregation in Los Angeles, IfNotNow is part of a generational shift among Jewish Americans who are alienated by signs of growing illiberalism in Israel.\n\n\u201cThere is an enormous number of young American Jews who felt that the only option they had was to buy into the party-line script of the right-wing nationalist support of Israel, or to abandon the Israel conversation altogether,\u201d she said.\n\nMembers of the group are more likely to be critical of the Israeli government than their parents and grandparents. A major 2013 Pew survey of American Jews showed that only a quarter of those aged 18 to 29 thought the Israeli government was \u201cmaking a sincere effort to bring about a peace settlement with the Palestinians.\u201d\n\nU.S. resistance to Israeli policies has existed for years, but it picked up speed after Trump was elected, according to Brous and others NBC News spoke to. The close relationship between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu \u2014 a hawkish politician who is in a coalition with Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox parties \u2014 has galvanized many, given that a majority of U.S. young people as well as Jews do not support the president. Netanyahu\u2019s links to the U.S. evangelical Christian community has also worried many liberal Jews.\n\n\u201cSome people are asking \u2014 how did all this happen?\u201d said Brous.\n\n\u201cHow could it be that my sweet Jewish democratic Israel is now detaining journalists at the border and not letting people into the country and interrogating people based on their political views?\u201d she asked, referring to the recent detention and questioning of Jewish journalists and activists as they arrived or left the country.\n\nAmong these was Peter Beinart, a prominent liberal American journalist who says he was held and interrogated about his contacts and activities at Ben Gurion Airport in early August. Netanyahu later said the detention was a mistake.\n\nThe change in attitudes among American Jews has traditionally not burst into the open because criticizing the state of Israel has long been anathema to community leaders, said Brous.\n\n\u201cThere is a tremendous fear about speaking honestly and openly about these Israeli, about Palestinians struggles, about these complexities, because you could lose your job,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the name of loving Israel, we have created a firewall to protect Israeli politicians and Israeli policies that I believe are ultimately undermining Israel\u2019s Jewish and democratic nature.\u201d\n\nAnother example of what many on the left consider to be an illiberal trend is the list of 20 organizations Israel has banned from entering the country because, the government says, they back the BDS movement, which supports boycotts, divestment, and sanctions on Israel.

A survey of Irish pediatricians found one-third of them were unaware of the existence of FASD and 17.3 percent believed mild alcohol intake in the third trimester is safe.\n\nDr. Kieran O\u2019Malley, a Belfast-based psychiatrist who has written extensively about the disorders, said some doctors across the border in Ireland simply don't believe that FASD exists.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I treat it as the last taboo. I think alcohol is so interwoven into our society it\u2019s hard to know where to begin,\u201d he said.\n\nO'Malley said the \"level of transgenerational alcohol brain injuries is astounding\" in Ireland, adding that \"nobody knows about it.\"\n\nPublic health specialist O\u2019Mahony agreed that \u201cconflicting advice is being given all over.\"\n\nFASD does not necessarily hit the poor harder, O\u2019Mahony said. Wealthier women who can afford expensive wine or spirits with dinner at home are also at risk of having a child with FASD. And it doesn\u2019t necessarily require drinking at what are considered problem levels. \u201cAlcohol and damage from alcohol doesn\u2019t discriminate by socioeconomic group,\u201d she said.\n\nPart of the confusion, O\u2019Mahony said, stems from the lack of research showing precisely how many drinks it takes to damage a fetus.\n\nA study on the global rates of FASD published last year in The Lancet found that for every 67 women who drank in pregnancy, at least one child was born with the most severe form of the disorder \u2014 Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \u2014 while nine or 10 others were born with symptoms on the spectrum.\n\nBody type, nutrition, other health conditions and even genetics can affect how the body metabolizes alcohol, and in turn how it affects a fetus. The high risk of having irreversible effects on a child is why many medical authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), recommend no alcohol intake in pregnancy.\n\nIreland\u2019s national statistics office says annual consumption in 2016 was 3.03 gallons of pure alcohol per capita. Considering an estimated 20 percent of the population doesn\u2019t drink at all, it raises the average for the drinking population to over 3.7 gallons annually. In comparison, per capita consumption in the U.S. in 2016 was 2.59 gallons.\n\nWrongly diagnosed?\n\nDavid Gerry understands the challenges that come with FASD first-hand. He raised two foster children with FASD and co-founded FASD Alliance Ireland, a support group for parents.\n\nWhat sets FASD apart from other cognitive disorders is the impact on the brain\u2019s ability to understand cause and effect. Children and adults with FASD struggle to learn from consequences as a result of the prenatal alcohol exposure.\n\nDavid Gerry leads workshops for Irish educators working with children who have Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Linda Givetash / NBC News\n\nGerry said his foster daughter was smart and an articulate and engaging speaker as a child, but her logic was different and she lacked the adaptive behavior skills needed to manage abstract concepts like money.\n\nThe impact of not getting the right support in school is among the reasons why Gerry targets educators in his awareness-raising about FASD.\n\nLast month, he ran a workshop for the Education Training Board for the county of Donegal. Many of the special-needs assistants attending the workshop said they could think of children in their schools who most likely have the disorder but have other diagnoses such as ADHD.\n\nThe educators said understanding the condition will allow them to adapt how they address children they suspect of having FASD by being clearer with instructions, breaking them down into smaller steps, and understanding that consequences are not an effective approach to disciplining bad behavior.\n\n\u201cFixing the environment is easier than fixing the kid,\u201d Gerry told them since brain damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure cannot be reversed.\n\n'No use crying over spilled milk'\n\nThe pregnancy screening test proposed by O\u2019Mahony this year is aimed at reducing the likelihood for FASD \u2014 or at least the most severe forms of the disorder \u2014 and was supported by the Irish Medical Organization.\n\nThe test would be done on a urine sample provided by a pregnant woman to her doctor, which is already part of routine checkups. O\u2019Mahony explained it wouldn\u2019t look for alcohol, which leaves the body soon after consumption, but a metabolite that lingers for up to five days after alcohol is consumed.\n\nThe test would be voluntary. A pilot project, which officials hope to launch in the next year, would determine whether women are receptive to the idea and ensure the results were accurate.\n\nPeople with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have a life expectancy of only 34 years, with the leading cause of death being suicide, according to a 2016 study in Canada. They are also over-represented in prisons and research from Canada estimated that youths with FASD are 19 times more likely to be incarcerated than those without the disorder.\n\nFor the children and adults already living with the disorder, Gerry said one of their biggest challenges is not knowing they have FASD.\n\nDiagnosing FASD can be difficult because the symptoms overlap with other disorders, and it requires a team of five specialists working with a patient to determine a result. There is no dedicated diagnostic service for FASD in Ireland, and there is only one clinic in England offering the service.\n\nGerry said that for his children, the FASD diagnosis made all the difference and allowed them to get the appropriate support.\n\n\u201cWhen someone gets a diagnosis, they can understand how they\u2019re different and as they grow up they\u2019re able to advocate for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than a child with cerebral palsy in a wheelchair \u2014 you have to build a ramp.\u201d\n\nBut O\u2019Mahony believes prevention \u2014 as opposed to diagnostic services \u2014 is the best place to invest.\n\n\"When a child is born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, the horse has bolted.

NBC News\n\nThe decline of bees and pollinators has been a growing concern around the planet.\n\nA study by the University of Vermont found that the wild bee population in the United States declined by 23 percent from 2008 and 2013. The most worrisome shortfall occurred in key agricultural regions, including California, the Pacific Northwest and the Mississippi River valley, that depend on pollinators.\n\nAmsterdam's municipal government has made significant investments, including creating a $38.5 million sustainability fund,in improving the environment \u2014 not only for bees but the entire ecosystem.\n\nIt also set a goal four years ago to convert half of all public green spaces to native plants \u2014 like outside the Sloterdijk train station.\n\n\u201cOur strategy is to when we design a park, we use native species but also the species that give a lot of flowering and fruit for (bees),\u201d Timmermans said.\n\nResidents and businesses are provided with information on how to avoid using pesticides with alternative treatments for private land.\n\n\u201c(Citizens) acknowledge the importance of the natural environment. It's part of the culture,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city also employs what Timmermans calls a \u201cnature-inclusive\u201d ideology in its design plans.\n\nDevelopers are also encouraged to install green roofs on new buildings, which help control the climate within the structure, reducing reliance on heating and cooling systems, and also create a better habitat for wildlife.\n\nSubsidies are available through the city for residents and owners looking to retrofit existing roofs or exterior walls.\n\nZoku, a hotel catering to business travelers and remote workers, designed a rooftop garden and dining area with the idea of bringing the outdoors in for people tied to their laptops.\n\nWith funding from the city covering 46 percent of the project's cost, it retrofitted the roof of the six-story building to include a diverse range of plant life from moss \u2014 typically used on green roofs \u2014 to vegetables and endangered shrubs.\n\nHotel guests and the public are welcome to lounge in hammocks or sit indoors by large windows overlooking both the rooftop greenery and city.\n\n\u201cPeople will stay here hugging a pillow and say I don\u2019t want to leave, I don\u2019t want to go into town,\u201d said Veerle Donders, Zoku's brand and concept manager. \u201cThey say it\u2019s really nice to see the sunset and ease their mind from city life.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not only a scenic escape for visitors, but the space is a feeding ground and home for bees that cluster around flower beds or in \u201cinsect hotels\u201d \u2014 small wooden structures with holes drilled through them to encourage bees and other bugs to nest \u2014 that hang on a few exterior walls.\n\nRoofs aren\u2019t the only spaces in the city becoming more green.\n\nVeerle Donders (right) with the Amsterdam hotel Zoku gives ecologist Geert Timmermans a tour of the company's rooftop garden.

A city ecologist can even offer consultation on what plants would most likely thrive in their neighborhood.\n\nFrom the street, fist-sized holes can be seen drilled into the exterior walls of some buildings. Timmermans said they serve as nesting space for swifts, bats and other birds.\n\nWhile these efforts appear to be having a positive effect on wildlife, it\u2019s unclear exactly how much damage urban development had on the bees and pollinators in Amsterdam before records were kept.\n\nTimmermans said an initial survey was conducted in 2000 to establish a baseline for future research, and whether a significant loss in bee species occurred before that is unknown.\n\nBees find food and refuge at the rooftop garden at Zoku, a hotel in Amsterdam.

Urbanization and the expansion of agriculture is leaving bees without native plants to consume and space to build hives or burrow.\n\nThe Dutch government introduced a pollinator strategy this year to revive bees, butterflies and other insects that are crucial to the cultivation of more than 75 percent of the country\u2019s food crop.\n\nPlanting one type or even a select variety of flowers or trees isn\u2019t a silver-bullet solution. Kleijn said individual species of bees rely on select species of plants, and studies have shown that the disappearance of certain plants is correlated with the loss of bees.\n\nWhile bee populations are improving in Amsterdam, concern remains high for the more than 300 species across the country.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nSept. 5, 2018, 8:30 AM GMT By Dan De Luce and Ken Dilanian\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 China has steadily loosened restrictions on trade with North Korea in recent months, undercutting President Donald Trump's effort to exert economic pressure on Kim Jong Un's regime, former U.S. officials and independent experts told NBC News.\n\nFrom coal shipments to revived construction projects to planes ferrying Chinese tourists to Pyongyang, China has reopened the door to both legal and illegal trade with the North, throwing the North Korean government a vital lifeline while derailing U.S. diplomacy. North Korea depends almost entirely on its larger neighbor to keep its economy afloat.\n\nThe increase in trade can be traced back to March, when the White House stunned Beijing by announcing plans for Trump to hold an unprecedented meeting with the North Korean dictator. Fearing a loss of influence with its often recalcitrant ally, China invited Kim to three successive summits in China, in March, May and June.\n\nWhile China rolled out the red carpet for Kim, Beijing's enforcement of U.N. sanctions began to soften and its limits on legal commerce also eased, according to regional analysts who track cross-border trade, foreign diplomats and former U.S. officials. As a result, the White House's bid to impose \"maximum pressure\" on North Korea, in hopes of pushing the regime to abandon its nuclear and missile program, has been dealt a severe blow.\n\nPresident Donald Trump welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago state in Palm Beach, Florida on April 6, 2017. Carlos Barria / Reuters file\n\n\"The Trump administration's much vaunted maximum pressure is now at best minimal pressure,\" said Daniel Russel, a former senior State Department official who oversaw China policy. \"And that means a huge loss of leverage.\"\n\nTrump's rush to meet with Kim \u2014 before U.S. and North Korean officials had time to hammer out a clear agenda or commitments from Pyongyang \u2014 doomed a relatively united international front against the North that had been painstakingly assembled, Russel and other former officials said.\n\nNow it could be almost impossible to reconstitute the pressure campaign. Apart from China's reluctance, South Korea's progressive President Moon Jae-in is openly promoting economic engagement with the North and does not share Washington's preference for strangling the regime's trade prospects.\n\nThe shift is evident at the Chinese port of Longkou, where North Korean cargo ships have been spotted pulling into coal docks, according to data obtained by NBC News from Windward, a firm that uses commercial satellites and other data to track maritime traffic. Ten North Korean cargo vessels visited the coal docks in May and June. Prior to that no North Korean ships had paid a visit to the port since January.\n\nTraffic has picked up on the border bridge to the Chinese city of Dandong, a main artery for North Korea. Small trucks carrying coal have been photographed moving across the border bridge, according to NK Pro, a specialist website that focuses exclusively on North Korea.\n\nCoal is a crucial source of revenue for Pyongyang and U.N. sanctions bar North Korea from shipping coal to China or elsewhere.\n\nThere are other signs of an economic thaw.\n\nGasoline prices in North Korea, which had soared as China squeezed fuel supplies last year, have steadily dropped since March. The Trump administration has blasted North Korea for skirting sanctions by obtaining oil at sea, conducting at least 89 ship-to-ship transfers of fuel.\n\nThe unofficial exchange rate for the euro in North Korea also shot up in the winter of this year as sanctions began to bite, but the rate came back down by June and July, NK Pro reported.

Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, recently blasted the European Union for making a $21 million payment to Iran, saying it \"sends the wrong message at the wrong time.\" The Europeans argue the payment shows Europe's continuing commitment to the nuclear deal.\n\nTrump administration officials have privately blamed President Barack Obama's top aides, including former Secretary of State John Kerry and top Treasury Department officials, for what they say is an organized campaign to undercut the current U.S. foreign policy. Trump officials pointed to recent speeches, visits to Europe and op-eds by former Obama aides calling for Europe to stay in the deal, suggesting that Obama's team is aiding foreign countries in evading sanctions.\n\nThe president took aim at Kerry more publicly over the weekend, calling him \"the father of the now terminated Iran deal\" and noting the speculation that Kerry may run against him in 2020. \"I should only be so lucky,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nBut some economists worry that the overuse of sanctions, particularly when other countries disagree with them, will lead the rest of the world to develop workarounds that may eventually diminish America's economic dominance. The concern is that other economic powers like China will market themselves as attractive alternatives where international corporations can bank without being told what to do.\n\nThen U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shakes hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif before a meeting in Geneva in 2015. Rick Wilking / Reuters file\n\nA president who doesn't fear 'third rails'\n\nUnder the 2015 deal struck by Obama, Iran and world powers, Tehran received billions in sanctions relief in exchange for curtailing its nuclear program. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal in May. As a result, some U.S. sanctions kicked back in earlier this month, and others take effect in November, including a prohibition on processing financial transactions for Iran.\n\nEuropean officials involved in discussions with Iran say that the Iranians want to stay in the deal despite the U.S. withdrawal, as long as they continue receiving enough economic benefits for it to be worthwhile. Last week the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog that monitors the deal, said in a new report that Iran is still complying with its obligations under the deal, despite the U.S. withdrawal.\n\nBut the sanctions include a U.S. threat to ban anyone who does business with Iran \u2014 even non-U.S. banks \u2014 from the American financial system. Because of the dominance of the U.S. banks, nearly every global transaction touches the U.S. in one way or another, even if only for a second as transactions are \"cleared.\" So the sanctions essentially force businesses and banks to choose between doing business with Iran or the United States.\n\nTo big, multi-national corporations, the choice has been obvious. Since Trump announced sanctions would be returning, major companies have started shutting down their Iran-related operations, including auto maker German automaker Daimler AG, French oil company Total SA and both British Airways and Air France, in a blow to the nuclear deal.\n\n\"There is clearly money to be made in Iran, but nothing like the business opportunities available in the U.S. market,\" said Adam Smith, a former senior sanctions official in the Obama Administration and partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.\n\nAs a result, the Europeans have narrowed their focus to small- and medium-sized businesses that have a footprint in Iran but no U.S. operations, and therefore may be more willing to take the risk.\n\n\"There are many companies in Europe able to fall into that category,\" said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"But they need small banks to do the financing, or central banks. People have to be paid, and it has to be converted to local currency.\"\n\nThat problem has led the Europeans to consider using their own central banks to transfer the money. Under that scheme, a central bank would collect hundreds or even thousands of planned transactions and \"bundle\" them together, sending the funds to Iran in one lump sum that would then be re-distributed to the intended recipients in Iran.\n\nEuropean central banks that send money to Iran would still be violating the same sanctions as commercial banks, and could be punished. But the countries are betting that Trump won't, given the dramatic economic implications of the U.S. slapping sanctions on the central bank of an ally.\n\nYet Iran hawks say if any president would take that risk, it's Trump.\n\n\"I think that actually is realistic under this president,\" said Richard Goldberg of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which advocates for a hard U.S. line on Iran. \"There have been so many third rails of trade relations that the president has not been afraid to touch.\"\n\nAnother major U.S.-flashpoint is SWIFT, a financial messaging service that is used ubiquitously by banks to send money from one place to another. November's sanctions call for Iran to be disconnected from SWIFT and say anyone who allows them to stay on the system will face sanctions. The U.K., Germany and France have all urged the U.S. to let Iran stay on the system, but Trump is expected to rebuff that request.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran on Aug. 13, 2018. Iranian government via Reuters\n\nSWIFT is based in Belgium, but its board includes top U.S. bank executives from Citigroup and J.P. Morgan, making it difficult for the messaging service to say no to Trump and risk sanctions. So European officials have been looking at creating their own \"clearing mechanism\" for transactions or alternative to SWIFT so transactions with Iran can continue.\n\n\"I want Europe to be a sovereign continent, not a vassal,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said recently. \"And that means having totally independent financing instruments that do not today exist.\" The idea has stoked divisions even within European governments. After German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas advocated creating a SWIFT alternative to \"protect European companies from sanctions,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel came out against it, warning it could undermine the transparency of the SWIFT system that helps root out fraud and terror financing.\n\nOther ideas the Europeans have floated have sputtered. A proposal to use the European Investment Bank to lend to European projects in Iran was shot down by the EIB's board, which was loath to risk sanctions.\n\nThe European Union this summer also revamped an arcane, little-used law known as the \"Blocking Statute,\" created in the 1990s to protect European businesses against the U.S. embargo on Cuba. The law prohibits European companies from complying with U.S. sanctions, and threatens to punish those who comply anyway.\n\nThat forces European companies who do business in Iran to make a choice: Break EU law by cutting off business with Iran, or break U.S. law by continuing.\n\nBut would the EU really punish its own companies for stopping business with Iran? How could they prove it was due to sanctions and not an unrelated business decision?\n\nThose complications have led even EU officials to concede that while the blocking statute sends a powerful diplomatic message \u2014 that the EU has its companies' backs \u2014 it is unlikely to be enforced in any meaningful way.\n\nThe Europeans have also been scrambling to figure out how strictly they must comply with Trump's sanctions requiring countries to stop importing Iranian oil. The Trump administration has given mixed messages, at first saying imports must drop to \"zero\" by November 5, then suggesting there could be some leniency. The law calls vaguely for \"significant\" reductions, which the Trump administration hasn't specifically defined.\n\nSome major importers of Iranian oil \u2014 like India, Japan and South Korea \u2014 are expected to continue to import some oil, creating a game of chicken as countries wager how much they can get away with without Trump punishing them. Another complication is the effect on oil prices and global supply-and-demand.\n\nOther countries are exploring more novel ways to sidestep the oil embargo. Under one idea being discussed, Russia would increase its oil imports under a goods-for-oil barter deal, then rebrand it as Russian oil before reselling it to third countries."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/despite-trump-s-promise-protect-them-christian-refugees-struggle-enter-n908501", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

They have been caught in the wider net of President Donald Trump\u2019s tough stance on immigration and refugees, which has lowered overall refugee admissions by the same percentage.\n\nEven Christians from the Middle East who have lived in the U.S. for years have been caught in the administration\u2019s wider crackdown on immigration, with dozens of Iraqi Christians now in detention and facing the threat of deportation.\n\nThe contrast between the administration\u2019s rhetoric and its actions has disappointed Christian activists and prompted accusations of hypocrisy from rights organizations and members of Congress.\n\n\"Ironically, these policies, while clearly aimed at Muslim refugees, ensure that Christians and other religious minorities from many of the countries on Trump\u2019s list of suspect travel ban nations are also kept out,\" said Mary Giovagnoli, director of Refugee Council USA. \"It suggests that the president has no real interest in religious persecution or the tenets of religious freedom.\"\n\nBut a Trump administration spokesperson rejected the criticism. \u201cThe administration has made helping persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East a top priority,\u201d the official said, citing humanitarian aid delivered to Christians and other vulnerable communities in northern Iraq.\n\nThe plight of 87 Iranian refugees illustrates how Trump\u2019s tough line on refugees from mostly Muslim countries has also closed the door to Christians and other religious minorities trying to flee to safety in the U.S.\n\nThe group of Iranians is mostly Christian, including Armenians and Aramaic-speaking Assyrians, but there are also representatives of other religious minorities \u2014 Zoroastrians, Mandeans and Jews. The Iranians have been stuck in a legal purgatory in Austria, some for as long as two years, as they await entry into the U.S.\n\nThis week they expect to learn whether the U.S. government will issue them visas, in individual decisions issued by the Department of Homeland Security expected Wednesday.\n\nThe Iranians in Austria applied for admission to the U.S. under the Lautenberg-Specter program, which was designed as a pathway to America \u2014 via a short stay for processing in Vienna \u2014 for religious minorities fleeing oppression from the former Soviet Union and Iran.\n\nUntil now the program \u2014 which dates back to the Cold War \u2014 has operated smoothly for years, with an acceptance rate close to 100 percent. But due to unprecedented delays, the short stay has stretched into as long as two years for some of the Iranians in Vienna, where they are unable to work and have become destitute.\n\nIraqi Syriac Christian priest Charbel Aesso gives the Eucharist during an Easter service at Saint John's Church (Mar Yohanna) in the nearly deserted predominantly Christian Iraqi town of Qaraqosh on April 16, 2017 near Mosul, Iraq.

A year later she, her son and her father got identical letters denying their entry, checking a box indicating \u201cother reasons\u201d as the basis.\n\n\"Mass denials of Iranian religious minorities stuck in Vienna demonstrate how religious minorities have been harmed under this administration,\u201d said Mariko Hirose, litigation director for the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nRefugee advocates told NBC News some of the Iranians have become homeless and some have taken to selling their blood plasma to help them feed their families.\n\nWhile the Iranians have waited in Vienna, evangelical Christians from Ukraine or other former Soviet republics have secured visas under the Lautenberg program without major delays, refugee resettlement agencies said.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the Iranian applicants to the Lautenberg program \u201care subject to the same stringent security vetting processes that apply to refugee applicants of other nationalities considered for admission to the United States of America.\u201d\n\nChristians, unlike some religious minorities, are recognized under Iran\u2019s constitution but regime authorities regularly raid churches, arrest and imprison Christians and target evangelical Christian converts, according to a report by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a federal commission.\n\n\u2018The Christian faith is under siege\u2019\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who has helped rally support among evangelical Christians for the Trump administration, has warned that the survival of Christian communities in the Middle East is in jeopardy and says that the U.S. stands ready to help.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, across the wider world, the Christian faith is under siege,\u201d Pence told a conference in May 2017 dedicated to persecuted Christians. \u201cAnd nowhere is this onslaught against our faith more evident than in the very ancient land where Christianity was born.\u201d\n\nWhile Pence has sought to shine a light on embattled Christians, a vocal wing of the administration led by presidential adviser Stephen Miller has championed sharp restrictions on the admissions of refugees and visa holders from countries deemed a security threat. As a result, Christian refugees have become \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d one aid worker said.\n\nIraqi Christians who fled the violence in the northern city of Mosul, pray at the MarAfram church in the village of Qaraqush, about 30 kms east of Mosul, in the northern province of Nineveh, on July 19, 2014.

As of Aug. 29, the number admitted in this fiscal year has plunged from 25,162 in 2017 to 14,289, in 2018, according to the State Department.\n\nKatie Waldman, a spokeswoman for DHS, defended the new procedures, saying \"the security improvements in the refugee program made in recent years to mandate additional screening for refugee applicants undoubtedly makes Americans safer.\"\n\nAt the 2017 conference where Pence made his speech about Christianity being under siege, including in Syria and Iraq, two Christians from Syria were scheduled to take part in a panel. But the two men were denied U.S. visas, according conference organizers, and could not attend after all.\n\nWhile Christian refugees face difficulties securing U.S. visas, hundreds of Iraqi Christians already in the U.S., many of whom fled their home country years ago, are now facing the threat of deportation.\n\nAbout a month after the vice president\u2019s speech on Christians on May 11, 2017, U.S. authorities began arresting hundreds of Iraqi immigrants in Michigan and elsewhere. The Iraqis were told they had violated immigration laws and were threatened with immediate deportation. Many of the Iraqis were Chaldean Christians and had been living in the U.S. for years, even decades.\n\nAn Iranian flag is removed from the stage after a group picture with foreign ministers and representatives of the United States, Iran, China, Russia, Britain, Germany, France and the European Union during the Iran nuclear talks in Vienna on July 14, 2015.

It's unclear if these moves will be enough to break the deadlock.\n\nAnd yet in the background, often drowned out by the din of Trump's headline-grabbing promises, a second, quieter set of negotiations between North and South Korea has been far more encouraging.\n\n\"There are currently two parallel diplomatic tracks in play: the peace track driven by Seoul and the denuclearization track driven by Washington,\" according to Abraham Denmark, a director at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\n\"The peace track has made much more progress so far,\" he said.\n\nA puzzle\n\nThe two Koreas, divided by a war in the 1950s that technically has never ended, have recently traded apocalyptic threats, deadly shell fire and even propaganda music blasted over the border by hulking loudspeakers. As recently as last September, Pyongyang warned it could wipe out the South in a nuclear strike.\n\nBut things began to change after the election last year of Moon Jae-in, a liberal human-rights lawyer, as South Korea's president.\n\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during their second summit on May 26.

Some who watch these talks closely say, if anyone is nominated, it should be Moon.\n\nSince Moon came to power, there have been big symbolic gestures. The Koreas fielded a united hockey team at the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, in February, and there was the historic meeting between Moon and Kim at the Demilitarized Zone months later.\n\nThe symbols also had some substance behind them. At their first summit, in April, Moon and Kim signed a detailed agreement called the Panmunjom Declaration in which they pledged to work toward ending the Korean War and avoid military provocations. It also allowed families divided by the war brief and emotional reunions, and held the promise of future economic ties.\n\nThis weekend, a military parade in Pyongyang marking 70 years since the country's foundation eschewed the usual display of long-range missiles for a float celebrating the declarations signed with the South.\n\nThe celebration also involved a vast gymnastic display involving 100,000 performers. Here, traditional songs praised Korean shared culture, and imagery focused on joining hands after seven decades of separation.\n\nThe showpiece involved thousands in the stadium holding up white cards that formed one giant screen. Onto this was beamed highlights of Kim and Moon's summit. The crowd erupted in applause, as did Kim who was in the audience.\n\nThe Panmunjom Declaration symbolized the different approaches taken by South Korea and the U.S. The declaration pledges to work toward denuclearization, but many analysts believe Moon sees a nuclear-free Korea as an eventual goal that might be achieved through step-by-step concessions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Moon said Trump and Kim needed to make \"make bold decisions,\" and urged the U.S. to \"take a corresponding step\" if the North is to denuclearize."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sergei-skripal-s-would-be-assassins-will-likely-escape-justice-n906526", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

She told lawmakers Wednesday that officers had been \"working around the clock\" and carrying out \"painstaking and methodical work.\"\n\nHowever, experts say the chance of arresting the men at the center of the investigation is virtually zero.\n\nAlexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov at Salisbury train station on March 3, the day before the Skripals were poisoned.

Article 61 is unequivocal: \"A citizen of the Russian Federation may not be deported from Russia or extradited to another state.\"\n\nU.K. officials have instead obtained a European Arrest Warrant, which means if either man steps inside the European Union they could be arrested.\n\n\"Should either of these individuals ever again travel outside Russia, we will take every possible step to detain them, to extradite them and to bring them to face justice here in the United Kingdom,\" May said.\n\nBut the likelihood of either suspect entering the E.U. \u2014 knowing it would likely lead to their immediate arrest \u2014 is low to say the least.\n\n\"If nothing else, it means these people, whatever their real names, will likely not be travelling much now,\" said Mark Galeotti, a senior nonresident fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague. \"Putting names and faces to the operatives helps the government make the case to its own people that this was a Kremlin hit.\"\n\nBritain has been down this road before.\n\nIn 2006, two former Russian spies, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi, allegedly carried out the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, another former intelligence officer, in London.\n\nAlexander Litvinenko receiving treatment at a London hospital on Nov. 20, 2006.

The sudden reintroduction of such checks on March 29, 2019, would cause huge traffic jams on freeways approaching ports both sides of the English Channel, authorities say.\n\nThe British government has even warned there could be shortages of food or medicines if trucks get stuck at the border or in miles of traffic.\n\n\u201cThere will be total gridlock unless they can negotiate some kind of a deal,\u201d said Mark Yates, the managing director of Active Transport, a Dover-based shipping company. \u201cIt will be a case of who blinks first.\u201d\n\nMilitary precision\n\nBelow the 300-foot chalk cliffs named after the town, dozens of roll-on, roll-off ships a day slide in and out of Europe\u2019s busiest ferry port.\n\nFrance is only 20 miles away. On a clear day, it can be seen across the water. Cellphones can also detect French networks.\n\nThat proximity has given the town strategic importance dating back thousands of years to the early settlers of the Bronze Age and the Romans.\n\nBut Dover is not just a port, it is part of England\u2019s psyche.\n\nIt has been a fortress town since 1066, when William the Conqueror built the first garrisoned Dover Castle on the highest point overlooking the sea.\n\nDuring World War II, the Dunkirk evacuations of May 1940 were masterminded from Dover, with over 200,000 troops brought ashore amid German aerial bombardment.\n\nChurchill, Britain's prime minister during the World War II, ordered the construction of a labyrinth of tunnels inside the cliffs to protect against German warplanes overhead.\n\nAnd singer Vera Lynn\u2019s sanguine chorus, \u201cThere\u2019ll be bluebirds over / the White Cliffs of Dover,\u201d became emblematic of the country\u2019s wartime spirit.\n\nDover's white cliffs are immortalized in song. Susannah Ireland / for NBC News\n\nBut military precision is still needed at the port.\n\nIt is here that the modern consumer dream of one-click online ordering and abundant fresh food meets physical reality. On a busy day, 10,000 trucks pass through Dover.\n\nA ferry can be unloaded and reloaded in 45 minutes, providing a round-the-clock shuttle schedule to the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk.\n\nThe slightest delays are a headache for freight companies, many of which are making just-in-time deliveries of fresh cargo such as fruit and flowers.\n\n\u201cAbout 50 percent of Britain\u2019s food is imported, mostly perishables from the rest of the E.U. \u2014 salad tomatoes, citrus fruits and so on,\u201d said Heidi Skinner, the policy manager with the Freight Transport Association lobby group.\n\nDover currently boasts \u201cfrictionless\u201d border controls: Drivers carry electronic paperwork and frontier formalities take less than two minutes per truck.\n\nA large, colorful reminder of the looming upheaval visible to drivers approaching Dover\u2019s sprawling harbor. A blue and yellow Banksy mural, depicting the removal of one star from the E.U. flag, covers the entire end of a roadside building and has become a tourist attraction in its own right. Susannah Ireland / for NBC News\n\n\u201cMost of them drive straight off the ferry and thunder on up the M20 or the A2 [highways] without stopping,\u201d said Paul Wells, director of Channel Ports, which checks imports on behalf of Britain\u2019s HMRC tax agency. \u201cIf we need an officer to check something, we\u2019ll call them. Otherwise it goes on through.\u201d\n\nClearance is required for only the 3 percent of trucks arriving annually at Dover with non-E.U. goods, mostly from Switzerland or Turkey.\n\nBut when the U.K. leaves the E.U. and the single market, it will have to impose controls on all vehicles unless it can negotiate a special exemption \u2014 something to which exasperated officials in Brussels are in no mood to agree.\n\n\u201cBritain absolutely needs a trade deal to ensure fluidity,\u201d Skinner said. Even slight increases in checks could cripple Britain\u2019s motorways, packing them with stationary trucks.\n\nImpact assessments seen by the FTA suggest that two-minute delays on every truck at Dover would would cause a 17-mile traffic jam. Four minutes would result in it stretching to Maidstone, which is 40 miles away.\n\n\u201cBased on the evidence we have heard, we do not believe the U.K.\u2019s ports and airports will be able to cope with the additional workload,\" a committee of British lawmakers concluded.\n\nMinisters have issued a series of \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d warnings about life after March 29, even as they express optimism that an agreement can be reached to avert chaos.\n\nThere are \u201cpotential issues around the border,\u201d Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab admitted earlier this month, adding, \u201cI'm still confident a good deal is within our sights.\u201d\n\nIt is a dangerous game of brinkmanship, based on the belief that exporters to the U.K. will be just as fearful of delays on the French side of the border.\n\n\u201cTheir businesses don\u2019t want it any more than we do,\u201d said Yates, the transport company executive. \u201cIf new requirements were imposed on us, they would need to get the same paperwork to come here and nobody needs the hassle.\"\n\nTransport firm boss Mark Yates fears gridlock will be a consequence of Brexit. Susannah Ireland / for NBC News\n\nHis fleet of 14 trucks, which carry mostly aircraft engine parts, could be among those stuck in a quagmire of customs delays if neither side backs down.\n\nYates doesn\u2019t know whether his business will be better or worse off, but his customers will likely have to wait longer for their goods.\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cIf the politicians and people in charge don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in six months\u2019 time, why should we?\u201d\n\nA Vatican City-sized parking lot?\n\nIn recent months, Britain\u2019s government has shifted focus from deciding what kind of deal it can strike with the E.U. to planning for the growing likelihood of no deal at all.\n\nThis summer, officials have begun to reveal no-deal contingency plans that have already cost taxpayers $4.8 billion.\n\nLocal lawmaker Charlie Elphicke says the government should speed up construction on a planned $300 million parking lot for 3,600 trucks a few miles up the M20 from Dover\n\n\u201cBigger than the Vatican City in size, this will be the second-largest park of its kind in the world,\" he noted in a report. \"This project is urgently required.\"\n\nDover's Castle Street looks up to the centuries-old fortress. Susannah Ireland / for NBC News\n\nIn July, British Health Minister Matt Hancock warned drug companies that they should seek an additional six-week supply to protect against post-Brexit port disruption.\n\nHowever, he urged family doctors and hospitals not to stockpile medicines because \u201cthe government has plans in place to ensure a continued supply.\"\n\nHMRC says it has upgraded its Customs Declaration Service computer system to cope with the extra traffic, and hired 1,113 extra border personnel out of a possible 5,000.\n\nBritish companies are also hunkering down for no-deal Brexit, which the IMF says could cost $300 billion in lost output.\n\nHeathrow Airport has set aside $1.5 billion to cover any losses in case flights are grounded by wrinkles over air route freedoms or the licensing of aircraft parts.\n\nGavin Darby, chief executive of Premier Foods, said some companies were stockpiling. \u201cSmart companies will have worked out where the pinch points are with ingredients and be building up inventory,\u201d he told The Financial Times.\n\nThe busy ferry port can be watched from Dover's white cliffs. Susannah Ireland / for NBC News\n\nAdrian Gee Turner, development manager for a pharmaceutical company in Ashford, 20 miles from Dover, says his supply chain has been made Brexit-proof by switching to alternative ports of entry.\n\n\u201cMost large organizations have contingency plans for major disruptions such as natural disasters or a pandemic and this is no different,\u201d he said.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked the London Resilience Forum, which assesses the impact of terrorist attacks and disasters, to consider the effect of Brexit on law and order.\n\nThere is also alarm in France, which similarly relies on smooth cross-Channel trade for economic stability. Some are calling for renewed London-Paris cooperation even if the E.U. does not reach a Brexit deal.\n\n\u201cThe period of collective stupefaction must end,\u201d said Xavier Bertrand, the president of the Regional Council of Hauts-de-France, where the port of Calais is.\n\nPredictions of doom\n\nLike many of Britain's coastal towns, Dover has seen its prosperity fade.\n\nWhere hotels once were thronged with vacationers, cars and motorhomes now rumble through on their way to more exotic resorts in France and Spain.\n\nEven the ferries are a double-edged sword, bringing visitors and some employment but also traffic congestion and asylum-seekers who jump from trucks after entering Britain illegally.\n\n\u201cIt is a very transient town,\" said Jill Sarjeant, administrator for five local church parishes.\n\nGroups of migrants, mostly from Romania, regularly congregate in Dover's main square. And the Eight Bells pub, run by pro-Brexit chain J.D. Wetherspoon, is busy with drinkers as early as 10:45 a.m.\n\nAll of which might explain why the town is pro-Brexit, despite its symbiotic reliance on nearby Europe for trade. Dover voted 62.1 percent to leave the E.U., well above the U.K. average of 51.9 percent.\n\n\u201cA lot of people voted that way because of immigration,\u201d said Nigel Collor, a local politician involved in Dover\u2019s Brexit preparations.\n\nA former port worker, he voted to remain in the E.U. but believes Brexit must go ahead. \u201cWe voted and that\u2019s what the country wanted.\"\n\nThe prospect of empty supermarket shelves and higher prices has led to calls for a second referendum in which voters could change their mind, although opinion polls are inconclusive.\n\nDarcy Tilney voted to remain in the E.U. Susannah Ireland / NBC News\n\nDarcy Tilney, 27, works for a freight logistics company. She thinks Brexit is \u201cridiculously bad.\"\n\n\u201cPeople don't want immigration, but Brexit won\u2019t reduce that and in any case borders are man-made,\" Tilney said. \u201cI sometimes feel like I\u2019m the only person here who doesn\u2019t think Brexit is a good thing.\"\n\nLuigi Del Duca, 67, opened the Castle Fish and Chip Shop in 1980 and fears border chaos will mean fewer vacationers, and fewer customers.\n\n\u201cThe town has been declining for years,\" he said. \"It will be sad if there are even less people around.\"\n\nOthers are suspicious that the predictions of doom are inflated by the media or by lawmakers trying to soften voters for an unpopular deal.\n\nArthur Salisbury, 70, sells ties adorned with the British flag.

An additional $290 million has been budgeted for the next five years.\n\nThe huge investment by China comes as the officially atheist country increasingly tries to enhance its image by casting itself as the largest nation of Buddhist believers. China claims some 300 million Buddhists of various schools, of which Tibetan Buddhism is one.\n\nThe effort comes as China faces charges from rights groups and exiles of repressing the Tibetan people. China has ruled Tibet with an iron fist since 1951, a year after its troops marched in.\n\nThe Dalai Lama in 2015. Ben Stansall / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nLast month, Vice President Mike Pence said Tibet's people \"have been brutally repressed by the Chinese government.\" And in June, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said conditions were \"fast deteriorating\" in Tibet.\n\nBeijing routinely denies charges of repression, saying that its rule ended serfdom and brought prosperity to what was a backward region, and that it fully respects the rights of the Tibetan people.\n\nIt insists Tibet has historically been part of its territory since the mid-13th century. Many Tibetans, though, say the region has been effectively independent for most of its history.\n\nWhile Beijing regards the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist who seeks to split off nearly a quarter of the land mass of the People's Republic of China, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Tibetan spiritual leader says he only seeks greater rights for Tibetans, including religious freedom and autonomy.\n\nReincarnation\n\nFor supporters of the Dalai Lama, China\u2019s Tibet strategy is \u201caimed at increasing its control and limiting the personal freedom of the Tibetan people,\u201d said Matteo Mecacci, a former lawmaker in Italy and president of the International Campaign for Tibet.\n\nHe called the infrastructure improvements and monastery renovations \u201csuperficial.\u201d\n\nMecacci said Tibetans are \u201cnot even allowed to receive teachings from the Dalai Lama.\u201d\n\nA portrait of Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Sera Monastery in Tibet.

Alexandar Amon Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh were members of a group of four jihadis dubbed \"The Beatles\" by observers because of their British accents.\n\nDetainees sent to Iraq would be held in Iraqi prisons with Iraqi guards, but the U.S. might retain the right to prosecute them if they could not be sent to their home countries, said officials.\n\nDemocrats in Congress and human rights groups oppose sending new detainees to Guantanamo and say those ISIS fighters suspected of murdering Americans should be tried in federal court, where they could be held accountable instead of held indefinitely without charges.\n\nRojda Felat, a Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander, waves her group's flag at the Al-Naim square in Raqa on October 17, 2017. Bulent Kilic / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., worries that sending the militants to Guantanamo would potentially turn them into martyrs. She has called on the Trump administration to prosecute those suspected of killing Americans in federal civilian courts to ensure they face justice.\n\nA spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen said she has advocated for the ISIS killers of journalist James Foley \"to be tried in federal courts in accordance with the wishes of the Foley family.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the Judiciary Committee, wants to see the two \"Beatles\" sent to Guantanamo as a temporary move before a possible trial in a civilian court in the U.S., a series of moves that would be prohibited under existing law.\n\nThe prisoners who may be destined for Iraq or Cuba would be drawn from a group of about 600 currently held by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in a rebel-controlled area of Syria, say the officials. Many of the detainees are foreign fighters, and range from foot soldiers plucked off the battlefield to the highest value detainees who were tracked and captured with help from the U.S. military.\n\nAlexanda Amon Kotey, from left, and El Shafee Elsheikh, who were allegedly among four British jihadis who made up a brutal Islamic State cell dubbed \"The Beatles,\" speak during an interview with The Associated Press at a security center in Kobani, Syria on March 30, 2018. Hussein Malla / AP file\n\nThe SDF, a majority Kurdish militia in northern Syria, has accumulated the prisoners over months of fighting, creating an increasingly challenging situation. The SDF continues to fight a complicated war and doesn't have the resources to detain, prosecute or protect hundreds of prisoners. In July Sens. Graham and Shaheen visited the prison where the SDF is holding the detainees.\n\nA spokesman for the National Security Council declined to comment on options for detained foreign fighters or the \"disposition of specific cases.\"\n\n\"Our partners in Syria are detaining terrorists who were captured or surrendered, including many foreign terrorist fighters,\" said the spokesman. \"All options will be considered. The president and his national security team will pursue the option that best protects the national security interests of the United States.\"\n\nThe State Department would neither confirm nor deny that such a move is among the options the administration is considering.\n\n\"We encourage all of our partners to take responsibility for their citizens, including prosecuting them for any crimes they've committed, and ensuring they cannot return to the battlefield. We will continue to pursue all diplomatic avenues. We have no further specifics to provide at this time,\" a State Department spokesperson told NBC News.\n\nAsked about the possibility of sending ISIS prisoners captured in Syria to Guantanamo, Pentagon spokesman Cdr. Sean Robertson would not discuss specific individuals, but said, \"DOD's detainee policy provides our warfighters guidance on nominating detainees for transfer to Guantanamo detention should the individual present a continuing, significant threat to the security of the United States.\"\n\nCdr. Sarah Higgins, a Defense Department spokesperson who focuses on detainee policy, said, \"There is no one identified to transfer to Guantanamo at this time.\"\n\nCountries refuse to take ISIS detainees\n\nThe U.S. has struggled for months to send the prisoners back to their countries of origin.\n\nU.S. officials started lobbying other countries to accept some of the detainees at a meeting of defense ministers in Rome in February.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. sent letters to a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Gulf nations, and others \u2013 nearly four dozen in all - informing them the SDF is holding their citizens. The letters included names and as much personal identifying information as possible for each person. The letters said the SDF could not hold these fighters long term and arrangements needed to be made for transfer and continued detention.\n\nAt first, no country agreed, according to the five U.S. officials, with one characterizing the response as \"mixed.\"\n\nOver the next several months the U.S. convinced several nations to repatriate their citizens. Earlier this month, Macedonia took seven fighters, and Lebanon took custody of eight.\n\nA guard walks into the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, also known as \"Gitmo\", a maximum security detention center at the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on Oct. 22, 2016. John Moore / Getty Images\n\nTwo senior U.S. defense officials confirm that both Tunisia and Kazakhstan have expressed some willingness to take custody of fighters being held in Syria. In the case of Tunisia, they may be willing to take more than 150 prisoners, but they want compensation.\n\nNathan Sales, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, was due to travel to Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco this week to discuss \"foreign terrorist fighters\" among other issues, the administration said in a statement on Monday.\n\nBut other countries have continued to decline U.S. requests. And another issue is the nearly 2,000 women and children \u2013 wives and kids of ISIS militants imprisoned or killed in fighting \u2013 who are now held in refugee camps. Their home countries don't want them back for fear they could bring radical ideology with them. The home countries fear \"later radicalization of the children, mental health issues from what the kids have lived through, especially the teenagers, and concern the women may have been radicalized as fighters,\" according to one U.S. official familiar with the discussions.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, which has tracked the status of the detainees in northern Syria, has appealed to the United States and its allies to ensure the ISIS fighters are brought to justice, but in a way that adheres to international law. The group recently criticized Washington over the transfer of eight of the detainees to Lebanon, saying the move raised the risk the men would be subject to torture and unfair trials.\n\nThe U.S. is still searching for a solution, but now is considering sending the fighters to a prison in Iraq. One official explained this would \"alleviate some of the security concern\" that the prisoners could escape.

Lee, Courtney Kube and Josh Lederman\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is increasingly venting frustration to his national security team about the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and showing renewed interest in a proposal by Blackwater founder Erik Prince to privatize the war, current and former senior administration officials said.\n\nPrince's idea, which first surfaced last year during the president's Afghanistan strategy review, envisions replacing troops with private military contractors who would work for a special U.S. envoy for the war who would report directly to the president.\n\nIt has raised ethical and security concerns among senior military officials, key lawmakers and members of Trump's national security team. A year after Trump's strategy announcement, his advisers are worried his impatience with the Afghanistan conflict will cause him to seriously consider proposals like Prince's or abruptly order a complete U.S. withdrawal, officials said.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, Prince said he believes Trump advisers who oppose his plan are painting \"as rosy a picture as they can\" of the situation on the ground, including that \"peace is around the corner\" with recent U.S. efforts for peace talks with the Taliban. He said he believes Trump's advisers \"over-emphasize the fluff and flare of these so-called peace talks.\"\n\nPrince, a staunch Trump supporter whose sister is Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, argues that after 17 years of war in Afghanistan, it's time for the U.S. to try something new.\n\n\"I know he's frustrated,\" Prince said of the president. \"He gave the Pentagon what they wanted. ...And they haven't delivered.\"\n\nPrince said he hasn't spoken directly to Trump about the plan, but told NBC News he plans to launch an aggressive media \"air campaign\" in coming days to try to get the president to embrace it.\n\nHis effort coincides with Tuesday's one-year anniversary of Trump announcing a strategy that increased the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan. Trump approved the Pentagon recommendations reluctantly.\n\n\"The strategy as announced a year ago was essentially just a dressed-up version of the status quo,\" said Jarrett Blanc, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served as a special representative on Afghanistan and Pakistan at the State Department during the Obama administration.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council said Trump is committed to the current strategy he signed off on after months of deliberations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump receives a briefing on a military strike on Syria from his National Security team, including a video teleconference with Secretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, on April 6, 2017. Shealah Craighead / The White House via Getty Images file\n\n\"No such proposal from Erik Prince is under consideration,\" the spokesperson said. \"The president, like most Americans, would like to see more progress in Afghanistan. However, he also recognizes that withdrawing precipitously from Afghanistan would lead to the re-emergence of terrorist safe havens, putting American national security and lives in danger.\"\n\nIn recent briefings with Trump, the president's advisers have emphasized the possibility of a political resolution with the Taliban and downplay the lack of military advances, officials said.\n\n\"The president hears about Afghan military and political progress and the possibility of reconciliation during his briefings, but he rarely gets the full picture of security on the ground,\" said one senior U.S. official who has seen the briefing materials.\n\nThe NSC spokesperson said, however, that the president is briefed regularly on Afghanistan, and \"his briefs are comprehensive, covering both positive improvements and problematic actions.\"\n\nA defense official said the current U.S. strategy in Afghanistan might not show significant results until at least next summer, complicating efforts to convince the president to stick with it.\n\n\"The current effort will show results, but it could be another year or more before the new advising mission makes a real, widespread difference on the ground,\" the official said.\n\nTrump's renewed interest in privatization was stoked by a recent video shot by Prince, according to a senior administration official, in which Prince argues that deploying private contractors instead of U.S. troops, and using limited government resources, would save the U.S. money.\n\nThe White House currently has no plans for a comprehensive Afghanistan policy review, officials said. While one could take place after a new U.S. military commander of the war takes over in coming weeks, some officials said the president's team has been reluctant to conduct one now out of concern about what the president will decide.\n\nPrince said he hopes to speak in coming days with some officials on the National Security Council about his proposal. He said that while last year he discussed it with Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when Pompeo was CIA director, he has not spoken to John Bolton, who become Trump's third national security adviser in April.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo at the Presidential Palace in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 9, 2018. Andrew Harnik / Reuters file\n\nThe defense official said Prince's idea hasn't made its way to the Pentagon for official consideration yet, but it could quickly become a real option if Trump pushes for it.\n\nMattis and Pompeo both oppose Prince's plan, officials said. A senior State Department official said there's \"not a chance\" it will be adopted.\n\nAsked for Bolton's view of Prince's idea, the NSC spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell Friday on MSNBC, Prince said his plan was not privatization, \u201cnot a private army. It is a very clear delineation of who\u2019s in charge, okay? The Afghan government working for a U.S. government official, funded by the United States at a fraction of a fraction of the cost of what we\u2019re spending now.\u201d Prince said his plan would save the U.S. more than $50 billion.\n\n\u201cThe president was right to campaign against endless wars,\u201d said Prince. \u201cIf we leave decisions on war solely to the Pentagon, we will be at war forever.\u201d\n\n'I like following my instincts'\n\nThe security situation in Afghanistan has worsened in the year since Trump signed off on the current strategy, and there are increased concerns about government stability and corruption in Kabul. The Taliban continues to make gains, while the U.S. has renewed efforts for peace talks with the militant group.\n\nAs NBC News reported in August 2017, before approving the plan the president complained to his advisers that the U.S. was losing the war and suggested firing Gen. John Nicholson, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan.\n\nWhen Trump announced the current strategy, he noted that his \"original instinct was to pull out, and historically I like following my instincts.\" But he said he'd decided to listen to his advisers to pursue an \"honorable and enduring outcome\" to the war. The U.S. currently has about 15,000 troops in Afghanistan.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that the president is \"committed to finding a political solution to end the conflict in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"As always, we're going to continue to review and look at the best ways to move forward,\" Sanders said.\n\nLately Trump has pressed his advisers about Afghanistan progress on a weekly basis in Cabinet meetings and national security briefings, officials said. As he's grown frustrated, Trump has leaned on Pompeo, the member of his national security team who is closest to him. Pompeo traveled to Afghanistan last month for a trip the administration said was designed to advance the current U.S. strategy.\n\nPrince was not an official adviser to the Trump campaign but donated $250,000 to pro-Trump causes during the campaign and met with members of Trump's national security team during the transition. The Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether Prince tried to establish a backchannel between Russia and the Trump administration during a meeting with a Putin associate in the Seychelles in 2017.\n\nIn his interview with Mitchell, Prince denied his meeting with the Russian was about a backchannel. \u201cIt was an incidental meeting and I had no follow up with him since then.\u201d\n\nWhen Prince's plan had Trump's attention in 2017, it had the backing of his former strategist Steve Bannon and the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.\n\nThe plan appealed to Trump because of the promise that it would be less expensive and put fewer American troops at risk than the current U.S. strategy.\n\nIt calls for private contractors and aircraft to aid Afghan forces, with some help from the CIA and the Pentagon's special operations forces \u2014 all of whom would be overseen by a U.S. government envoy for Afghanistan policy who reports directly to the president and is given the authority to coordinate with the Afghan government.\n\nPrince believes Trump's frustration now could provide a path for the privatization idea. Trump also has shown more of a willingness follow his instincts on foreign policy since reshuffling his national security team earlier this year to replace former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2014 both of whom opposed Prince's plan.\n\nU.S. service members walk off a helicopter on the runway at Camp Bost on Sept. 11, 2017 in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Andrew Renneisen / Getty Images file\n\nA former senior administration official said while the U.S. has relied on foreign governments to help pay for military conflicts, it would be new to ask those countries to pay private security companies directly.\n\nPrince's close ties to the United Arab Emirates, as well as the record of Blackwater, most notably in Iraq, would likely raise strong objections among administration officials and members of Congress. In 2007, Blackwater security contractors escorting a U.S. embassy convoy killed 17 civilians in Baghdad's Nisour Square. One employee was convicted of first-degree murder and three were convicted of manslaughter, but their verdicts were overturned in 2017.\n\nThe use of private security contractors in U.S. military conflicts has been controversial, including in Afghanistan. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai curtailed the use of security contractors, a policy the current government would have to undo for a plan like the one proposed by Prince to be implemented.\n\n\"It's a ridiculous idea. It would only make things worse, prolong the war, and cause more deaths,\" the former senior administration official said.\n\nBrian Katulis, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said privatization would make it harder for Congress and others to know what precisely is happening in the war.\n\n\"It makes an already murky position murkier,\" Katulis said. \"The cost savings is not worth the potential damage to oversight of U.S. national security.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/behind-the-smile-the-descendants-of-the-real-mona-lisa-1290657859908", "text": "Behind the smile: The descendants of the real Mona Lisa 05:03 copied!\n\nThere are a handful of theories of who was the real person behind Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa.

But like elsewhere in Europe, Poles significantly overestimate the proportion of people in their country from outside of the bloc \u2014 believing they make up 10 percent of Poland's 38 million-strong population.\n\nA poll conducted by the country's Center for Research on Public Opinion in June found that 5 percent of people in Poland believed refugees fleeing war should be allowed to settle in the country. Some 29 percent said refugees should be allowed to stay until they can return home, while 60 percent said refugees fleeing conflict shouldn't be accepted.\n\nThe same poll conducted in May 2015 found that 14 percent of Polish people felt refugees fleeing conflict should be allowed to settle, while 58 percent said they should be able to stay until they can return home and 21 percent said they shouldn\u2019t be accepted.\n\nThe Polish government has repeatedly resisted taking in migrants from the Middle East and North Africa, saying it has taken in thousands of asylum-seekers from the conflict in Ukraine instead."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/slaughter-starving-wild-horses-divides-netherlands-n895156", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Animals within its perimeter must fend for themselves. However, any creatures believed to be suffering are shot by rangers at the site.\n\nHarsh winter weather left piles of dead horses littered around the site. Most of the remains were later removed, but the ghoulish sight of hungry animals just under an hour's drive from Amsterdam led some protesters to cut down fences to free them. Others threw food to the visibly weak animals.\n\nOostvaardersplassen is now at the center of a lawsuit that aims to prevent a repeat of the carnage in the months to come by allowing more human intervention on the untouched land and relocating animals to other sites.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such skinny horses,\u201d recalled Cynthia Danvers, who filed the lawsuit along with her friend and fellow equestrian Annemieke van Straatenafter after visiting in February. \u201cWe saw so many dead animals. \u2026 It was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe relatively new park consists of forest, grassland and swamp. The Dutch built dikes to drain the area with plans to use it for industrial purposes in the 1960s. But it was never developed and nature was allowed to take over as an example of \"rewilding.\"\n\nFrans Vera, an ecologist, had the idea to introduce large grazers to control the density of the grasses, reeds and shrubs that were growing. In 1983, 32 Heck cattle, 18 Konik horses and 40 red deer were brought to the Oostvaardersplassen. Generations later, thousands of animals live there.\n\nEndangered birds began migrating to the site early on in the rewilding process and the theory was the large grazers would keep the landscape favorable for them \u2014 while still being allowed to run wild.\n\nKonik horses graze in Oostvaardersplassen. Linda Givetash / NBC News\n\nJoke Bijl, a spokesman for the state forestry service Staatsbosbeheer, said the animals are treated as wild and aren\u2019t fed or treated medically to keep the population from growing beyond what the land can support.\n\nBut the grazers are watched by rangers to ensure they don\u2019t suffer. \u201cWhen an animal is stuck in the mud, we help it, and if we see in the early winter or summer a deer has a broken leg, the animal is shot. We don\u2019t leave it to die naturally,\u201d she said.\n\nA lot of animals were shot last winter. In March alone, the park service reported the deaths of 1,155 large grazers, including 157 horses.\n\nNo surprise\n\nThe grazer population reached an all-time peak of 5,230 last fall. The total deaths for the season topped 3,000. Around 90 percent of the grazers were killed by rangers before they succumbed to the severe conditions.\n\nThe carnage didn\u2019t come as a big surprise to the park service. Bijl said the record number of animals there going into the winter meant less food to go around, leaving inhabitants vulnerable.\n\nThen came unfavorable weather.\n\nRanger Mikal Folkertsma said heavy rain through December turned fields into mud pits, making any remaining grass from the summer inedible.\n\nThat was followed by a cold snap in March that brought freezing winds and iced over the ground, leaving already weak animals in worse condition.\n\nPark ranger Mikal Folkertsma checks on animals in Oostvaardersplassen. Linda Givetash / NBC News\n\nThere was one night that was particularly bad for deer. \u201cOne ranger said, 'Yesterday they were in good condition, they reacted normally, and the next day there were 20 dead' \u2026 because it was so cold,\u201d Folkertsma recalled.\n\nSome of the surviving animals gathered near the edge of the reserve, where passersby took notice of their plight.\n\nDanvers and van Straaten, who are heavily involved in the equestrian community, decided to harness the outrage over the animals\u2019 deaths and started a foundation that campaigns for changes in how the reserve is managed.\n\nThey want the grazers relocated to a more suitable environment, and in the interim, to be provided with food and better care when necessary. Their Facebook group has nearly 80,000 members, who are demanding that all of the animals be rescued from the reserve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop this,\u201d van Straaten said.\n\nA 'reset'\n\nAmid the public pressure, a report was commissioned this year on how to manage the grazers in the future and avoid a repeat of another devastating winter.\n\nThe report released this spring recommended a \u201creset\u201d of the land by reducing the number of grazers to allow the landscape time to rejuvenate from overgrazing. It pegged a sustainable level of large grazers at 1,100 total \u2014 about half the number currently living in the area.\n\nBut that raises raises the question of how to reduce the population.\n\nWhile the roughly 200 excess horses can be moved elsewhere, culling the 980 deer required to reach the target number is contentious.\n\nOostvaardersplassen is a 14,800-acre man-made nature reserve. Linda Givetash / NBC News\n\n\u201cThe alternative, to capture the deer and get them on transport, would not be easy and would also put a lot of stress on the deer, so is that the solution? I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harold Hofstra, a local lawmaker.\n\nChanges to the landscape were also recommended to provide more forested shelter to the animals. This is expected to cost the provincial government up to 15 million euros ($17.2 milion).\n\nThe grazers that survived the winter appeared to be thriving during a visit last month. Although unseasonably hot, dry conditions have left the ground hard and shrunken some pools, there were still dense grassy patches where cattle and horses could be found eating and playing.\n\nNature vs. emotions\n\nTo prevent the government from authorizing a cull, Danvers and van Straaten are taking legal action.\n\nBas Jongmans, their attorney, filed a lawsuit on July 25 asking for a temporary ban on shooting healthy animals, instead forcing the grazers to be relocated.\n\nThey also want the government to be held accountable for the welfare of the animals. Jongmans said the government's endorsement of a report that didn\u2019t have a clear solution on how to reduce the deer population was an example of passing the buck. \u201cNo one is taking responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nJongmans argues that these animals, and the reserve itself, are not truly wild. \u201cIf you consider it as nature, you should not put a fence around it,\u201d he said.\n\nFrank Berendse, professor emeritus of ecology at Wageningen University, was Vera's supervisor when he came up with the idea.\n\nBerendse said for the first 15 years the park flourished as anticipated.

He also guards the tree from squirrels and monkeys that could damage its branches, and he\u2019s there to support it through snowstorms and typhoons.\n\nWhile protecting the Greeting Pine from animals and monitoring for disease takes patience \u2014 and a high-tech motion-detection and surveillance system \u2014 Hu\u2019s biggest challenge isn\u2019t a vigorous animal looking for a new home.

Mac William Bishop / NBC News\n\nAs income levels rise, ever-increasing numbers of Chinese are starting to travel domestically. Tens of millions of tourists now flock to China\u2019s national parks every year.\n\nMore than 3.3 million people traveled to Huangshan in Anhui Province in 2016, according to the local tourism bureau. And almost all of these visitors invariably pause for a portrait or a selfie in front of the Greeting Pine.\n\nDr. Zhan Dongmei, a specialist in scenic areas at the China Tourism Academy, said the \"concepts of environmental protection and sustainable eco-tourism\" did not exist when the tourism industry was established four decades ago.\n\nAir pollution in major cities like Beijing may be the more visible indications of China\u2019s struggle to contain the damage wrought by its rapid industrialization, but scenic areas like Huangshan are increasingly on the front lines in the battle to protect the country\u2019s natural beauty and environment.\n\nHuangshan Mountain is in Anhui Province in eastern China. Getty Images / Getty Images\n\n\u201cFamous scenic sites often have millennia of history as sacred sites,\u201d said Dr. Judith Shapiro, a researcher at American University and the author of \"China\u2019s Environmental Challenges.\"\n\n\u201cThese places have always been desirable destinations for their landscapes and spiritual values,\" she said. \"What has changed is that the Chinese now have disposable income to allow them to travel for pleasure, and these sites are becoming inundated with commercial enterprises and the tourists who use them. As a result some sites are being \u2018loved to death.\u2019\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s government is increasingly focused on environmental issues.\n\nIn October, President Xi Jinping gave an annual speech to the National People\u2019s Congress \u2014 roughly analogous to America's State of the Union address. Over three hours, Xi mentioned the environment or related terms 89 times, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence, while mentioning the economy only 70 times.\n\nChina must \u201censure that the ecology and environment are fundamentally improved by 2035, and that our goal of building a beautiful China is basically achieved,\u201d Xi told the People\u2019s Congress.\n\nThis is a marked shift from the growth-at-all-costs philosophy that has been at the core of Beijing\u2019s economic policy over the past 40 years, since Deng Xiaoping initiated the pragmatic reforms aimed at transforming to a market economy. While the lifting of hundreds of millions out of stark poverty is among the greatest achievements of the modern Chinese state, rapid growth and industrialization have come at a cost.\n\nChinese metropolises are consistently ranked among the unhealthiest places in the world to live because of air pollution, and citizens are becoming less and less worried about vociferously asserting their right to live in a clean environment.\n\nTourists thread their way through a narrow pass on Huangshan. As the number of visitors to these areas grows each year, authorities are increasingly under pressure to manage access and the environmental impact of tourism. Mac William Bishop / NBC News\n\n\u201cEnvironmental mass incidents\u201d that range from minor protests to major outbreaks of civil unrest now number in the thousands each year, according to research published by the Wilson Center\u2019s China Environment Forum.\n\nIn May 2014, thousands of people took to the streets in Hangzhou \u2014 just over 100 miles east of Huangshan \u2014 to decry the opening of a new coal power plant. Demonstrations turned violent as protesters clashed with security forces, leaving dozens injured.\n\nThe linkage between quality of life and public security has not been lost on the authorities, and is part of the reason Beijing is taking a keen interest in speaking publicly about environmental issues.\n\n\u201cThe central government is basically telling people to be patient,\u201d Shapiro said, adding that crackdowns on local officials have resulted in hundreds of arrests for those found to be in \u201cnoncompliance\u201d with anti-pollution laws and environmental regulations. \u201cThe central government is sending the message that the people should trust them to deal with the middle and lower levels of officialdom, who are not obeying the laws.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Chinese officials must now prove to the central authorities that they are making progress based on environmental standards if they hope to gain promotion within the party. That is a shift from even a few years ago, when the primary metrics for success were economic growth and social stability.\n\nImproving those metrics shouldn\u2019t be hard, in theory: China has some of the world\u2019s toughest and most stringent environmental laws on the books, and hundreds of geographic locations fall under a variety of environmentally protected designations.\n\nBut researchers note that many of these \u201cnational parks\u201d exist primarily on paper: \u201cExtractive activities\u201d like logging or mining still continue, sacrificing natural beauty and biodiversity for profit.\n\nThe issue is one of enforcement and implementation.\n\n\u201cSimply limiting the number of visitors will not relieve the pressure,\u201d Zhan said. The key, she explained, was in designing \u201csmart\u201d tourist sites in areas of natural beauty that enabled local authorities to manage access and control the flow of visitors. This requires planning and effective implementation by those charged with overseeing the parks.\n\nExtensive visitor facilities have been constructed on Huangshan to support the millions of tourists that visit one of China\u2019s most iconic natural parks each year. Mac William Bishop / NBC News\n\nManaging a balance between environmental sustainability and economic growth is a visible challenge on Huangshan mountain, where an endless stream of tour groups pushes against the fence guarding the Greeting Pine trying to get a better look.\n\nHu Xiaochun understands their interest.\n\n\u201cWhenever I\u2019m away from home, for example during the time I was serving in the army, every time I told someone I was from Anhui, the first thing flashed across their mind would be Huangshan,\u201d Hu said. \u201cAnd when they think about Huangshan, the first thing that appears in their mind is the Greeting Pine.\u201d\n\nBut he shrugs philosophically as he pushes through the crowd.\n\n\u201cI can only protect it, and guard its life,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I am doing here is a unique job.

He spends most of his time enveloped by the substantial Turkish community in this industrial city.\n\nRestaurant owner Harun Kiki moved from Turkey to Germany 18 years ago, but says he still feels more Turkish than German. Hilarius Riese / for NBC News\n\nBut Kiki bristled when asked whether he could be perceived as an example of how some Turks have failed to integrate into German society. He is a self-made businessman who runs a successful upscale restaurant and contributes to the local economy.\n\n\u201cI admit it\u2019s right that I should be made to learn German, but I would also say I have a business which employs 40 people and I pay my taxes here,\u201d he said, as chefs busied themselves behind glass counters filled with freshly prepared meats and vegetables.\n\nAlmost 3 million people of Turkish origin or descent live in Germany, many the second- and third-generation relatives of guest workers who were welcomed during the economic boom of the 1950s and \u201960s.\n\nThe more recent influx of 1 million migrants who arrived as Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the borders of Europe's economic powerhouse in 2015 has reignited an uncomfortable debate about what it means to be German.\n\nThe issue of national identity has traditionally been complicated by the legacy of World War II.\n\nPlagued by historic guilt, Germans have been hesitant to be too self-confident or cheerful in expressing national pride, fearing that modern-day patriotism could quickly be seen as a form of nationalism too close to its Nazi past.\n\nWhile Merkel insisted \"we can do this\" when allowing the asylum-seekers to enter, her decision has spurred on the political resurgence of the far-right.\n\nFor Germans of Turkish background, the country's largest minority group, their experience may offer a glimpse of the struggle with identity that migrants who arrived in 2015 will almost certainly face in the future. Some 60 years after many of their parents and grandparents arrived, many of them say they still do not feel accepted here.\n\nThat sentiment was exposed last month when German-born soccer superstar Mesut \u00d6zil, whose grandparents relocated from Turkey, resigned from the national team. He accused its officials of racism.\n\nMesut \u00d6zil, who is of Turkish descent, played for Germany in the World Cup but recently quit the national team. David Ramos / Getty Images\n\n\u201cI am a German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose,\u201d he said in the letter announcing his decision. \"I am still not accepted into society.\"\n\n\u00d6zil pointed out that former national team colleagues Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose \"are never referred to as German-Polish, so why am I German-Turkish?\"\n\nHe added: \"Is it because I am a Muslim? ... I was born and educated in Germany, so why don't people accept that I am German?\"\n\n'I feel like I'm in Turkey here'\n\nIt is easy enough to see how it's possible for someone like Kiki, the restaurant owner, to have not learned German after almost two decades in a place like Duisburg.\n\nTurkish is the language predominantly spoken at the tables and in the open kitchen at his business.\n\nAnd only a short walk away, the Marxloh district buzzes with more Turkish restaurants and the soft sound of the Muslim call to prayer.\n\nThe neighborhood is home to one of the country\u2019s largest mosques and the Wedding Mile, a shopping destination for Turkish brides-to-be from across Europe.\n\nOne of the many wedding dress stores on Duisburg's Weseler Street \u2014 which is also known at the Wedding Mile.

But when faced with having to pick a passport, he opted for Turkish citizenship instead of obtaining a German one.

Experts say many second- and third-generation people of Turkish descent in Germany feel similarly conflicted.\n\nA report published last month by the Center of Turkish Studies at the University of Duisburg-Essen found that most people with Turkish roots living in Germany feel more connected to Ankara than to Berlin.\n\n\u201cThe younger generation is in an identity crisis,\u201d said Serap G\u00fcler, a local official with responsibility for refugees and integration in the state where Duisburg is.\n\nWomen wearing headscarves walk down a street in Duisburg, Germany. Hilarius Riese / for NBC News\n\nShe said that people whose grandparents had moved to Germany appeared to be struggling the most with such questions.\n\n\u201cThey have the feeling that no matter what they do, no matter how hard they strive, whatever they deliver, they will never be accepted as Germans,\u201d G\u00fcler said.\n\nThis often leads them to feel Turkish, even though their knowledge of the country and its language is often limited.\n\nRandall Hansen, the interim director of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto, says it\u2019s not unusual for the children and grandchildren of migrants to feel less welcome than those who actually relocated.\n\n\u201cWhen their parents came they were just grateful to get a job, to be left alone, to not be beaten up in the street,\" he said. \"But anyone who was born here expects to be treated like any other German.\"\n\nA Turkish flag hangs above food stalls during a recent festival in Duisburg, Germany. Hilarius Riese / for NBC News\n\nHansen said assimilation can often be difficult because Germans themselves \"don't really know what it means to be German.\"\n\nThe U.S. has been built around the concept of the melting pot, Canada promotes a multicultural society and France pushes a positive assimilation model, with a clear idea of national identity. But Germany doesn't slot neatly into any of these traditions, Hansen said.\n\n\"If there\u2019s a binding identity in Germany it\u2019s constitutional patriotism,\" he said, defining this as the belief in the rule of law and broad support for liberal values, such as the rights of women and ethnic minorities.\n\nChanging times\n\nSome Germans find Turkish pride difficult to process, particularly when it's boldly and blatantly on display.\n\nHeinz Bandurski.

He cited the rise of the far-right AfD party, which captured 12.6 percent of the vote and 94 seats in Parliament in last year's federal election.\n\nIn the district of Duisburg-Hamborn, which includes the neighborhood featuring the Wedding Mile and Kiki\u2019s Turkish restaurant, the party won almost 20 percent support.\n\nThe AfD has played heavily on the rising numbers of Muslim migrants in the country. \u201cBurqas?\u201d read one campaign poster before the election. \u201cWe prefer bikinis.\u201d\n\nAfD placards reading \"Merkel must leave!\" and \"Burqas?

She was like the \u2018it girl.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe was even crowned as the city\u2019s \u201cQueen of Beauty\u201d during a jousting tournament organized by the powerful Medici family in 1475.\n\nRocky Ruggiero, a Renaissance art expert from Rhode Island, who lives and teaches in Florence, said while there was little documentation about Simonetta and Botticelli's relationship, it was \"highly improbable\" that they didn't know each other.\n\n\u201cThey both lived on Via Nuova, a tiny street, 200 meters from each other,\" he said. \"So the fact is that they probably would bump into each other on a fairly regular basis.\"\n\nThe pair are buried next to each other at the Church of All Saints.\n\n\u201cWhen Simonetta died in 1476 her funeral was held here and had a very special privilege, in that the casket was left open, so that the people of Florence could look upon her beauty one more time before she was entombed forever,\u201d Ruggiero said. \u201cThirty-four years later, when Botticelli passed away, he specifically requested to be buried at her feet. So still today you can see their tombs side by side, for eternity.\u201d\n\nSimonetta died 23, a decade before Botticelli painted \u201cThe Birth of Venus.\u201d While that means she didn't pose for him at the time, Simonetta believes her relative's beauty stuck with the painter.\n\n\u201cShe was his muse,\" she said. \"Maybe it wasn\u2019t a love affair, but this love, this inspiration lasted forever.\"\n\nWhile Simonetta\u2019s claim that her ancestor and namesake was the inspiration behind the Venus is credible, it is impossible to verify. But it's unquestionable that it has made her a lover of the arts.\n\nToday, she is a manager at Rosenfeld Porcini, an art gallery in London.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting how, even though every day I work with young, contemporary living artists, I always like to look back at 'The Birth of Venus,' and see where I come from.\u201d\n\nThat enduring gaze: the 'Mona Lisa'\n\nSisters Natalia and Irina Strozzi are the youngest generation in a dynasty so ancient that a drawing of its family tree spreads across the walls of an entire staircase in their thousand-year-old estate in the Tuscan countryside.\n\nFor parts of the 15th century, the Strozzi were the richest and most influential family in Florence.\n\nTheir descendants included bankers, musicians, a cardinal and even a relative of Winston Churchill, yet only one portrait hangs on the wall of their ancestral home: a copy of da Vinci\u2019s \"Mona Lisa.\"\n\nSisters Natalia and Irina Strozzi pose next to the Mona Lisa at the Louvre in Paris. Natalia and Irina Strozzi\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a portrait of Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo, one of our ancestors from 15 generations ago,\u201d Natalia said. \u201cBut, of course, everyone knows her as 'Mona Lisa.'\u201d\n\nLisa Gherardini was the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, a silk merchant and a friend of da Vinci\u2019s.\n\n\u201cFrancesco must have asked Leonardo to paint his wife, probably to celebrate the birth of one of their children,\" Natalia said. \"It was nothing out of the ordinary.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees. The portrait has been the focus of centuries of speculation and conspiracy theories as to the subject's true identity.\n\nSome insist it\u2019s the portrait of an ideal woman, while others claim it is da Vinci\u2019s self-portrait. Many, however, agree with Natalia and Irina that, if the \"Mona Lisa\" was based on a real woman, it is their ancestor.\n\n\u201cI can tell you with complete certainty that the sitter in Leonardo\u2019s famous portrait is in fact Lisa del Giocondo,\u201d said art historian Rab Hatfield, who spent years researching the \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThey can be certain that this in fact is their ancestor.\u201d\n\nThe sisters now spend their time running the winery that has been in their family since the 13th century. But their connection to the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d remains a point of pride.\n\n\u201cWe have the same blood running in our veins,\u201d Irina said.\n\nThe Caravaggio conundrum\n\nDuring the Renaissance, many artists were named after the towns they came from.\n\nJust as Leonardo was from the Tuscan hamlet of Vinci (\u201cda\u201d mean \"from\" in Italian), Michelangelo Merisi called himself Caravaggio, after the small town in northern Italy where he grew up.\n\nHe is as famous for his use of light and shadow to create intense, realistic images as he is for his rebellious, violent character. The young artist is said to have killed a man during a brawl in Rome and then died under mysterious circumstances on a beach in Tuscany.\n\nHowever, unlike many of his fellow contemporary artists, both his town and his surname survived.\n\n\u201cMany of us are called Merisio in this town. Even Caravaggio must have been called Merisio, as the \u2018o\u2019 was later dropped in the translation from Latin,\u201d explained Alberto Merisio, 77, a retired engineer and an amateur painter.\n\n\u201cSo almost all of us thought, at some point, that we must have been descendants of the great painter. Deep down I always hoped I was related to him.\u201d\n\nAlberto\u2019s dream came true in 2010, when a group of experts from three universities collected DNA samples from people who shared his surname and who lived in the town.\n\nPhotojournalist Pepi Merisio is a descendant of Caravaggio. Pepi Merisio\n\nGiven the mysterious nature of the artist\u2019s death, the first thing researchers had to do was positively identify Caravaggio\u2019s remains.\n\n\u201cTo solve this enigma, we analyzed the bones unearthed in the cemetery where he was believed to have been buried. Only one matched his profile: It belonged to a 40-year-old man from the time of his death, and had a high concentration of lead, typical of painters,\u201d said Silvano Vinceti, who led the group of researchers,\n\nThey then compared Caravaggio's DNA with that of the local residents.\n\n\"Many tested positive, including Alberto,\" Vinceti said. \"So not only did we know we had Caravaggio\u2019s remains, but we also found that several people there are related to him.\u201d\n\nAnother person who tested positive was Pepi Merisio, 88, a photojournalist who spent decades documenting Italian life for major magazines.\n\nOf the many pictures Pepi took, one is of Feniglia beach in Tuscany where Caravaggio is believed to have died.\n\nCaravaggio is believed to have died on Feniglia beach in Tuscany. Pepi Merisio\n\nIt shows a strip of sand with overgrown brushwood and trunks of wood washed ashore by the sea \u2014 a lonely place to die.\n\n\u201cSome critics say that I take photos like Caravaggio painted,\u201d Pepi said. \u201cThe comparison is not that disproportionate. We both understood that lighting is what makes the difference.\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/decade-after-war-putin-backed-borderization-costs-georgia-land-n892321", "text": "Some U.S. officials do care, though.

Annie Sakkab / for NBC News\n\nNearly 6 million Syrians have fled their country since 2011. Mafraq \u2014 the city's name is said to mean \u201ccrossroads\u201d \u2014 is home to nearly 84,000 Syrian refugees. They now outnumber Jordanians.\n\nIn many ways those in the city are the lucky ones. Just east of town, in what seven years ago was empty desert, lies the sprawling Zaatari Camp. An estimated 80,000 refugees live in its two square miles of makeshift homes. Most of the shelters are corrugated tin shacks with canvas tarps on top.\n\nIn June, the Assad regime began its ongoing assault on ISIS-affiliated militants in Syria\u2019s Daraa Province just north of the camp. More than 230,000 civilians were displaced at the height of the fighting. Jordan has so far refused to take in the new refugees.\n\nHeritage lost\n\nThe course began last October with 30 trainees, but has now grown to 45 and includes six Jordanians. It is nearly evenly made up of women and men, an effort to break down the traditional gender gap in stonemasonry.\n\nWeaving among his students to offer encouragement or, just as often, criticism, is Tony Steel, a 70-year-old British master stonemason with the World Monuments Fund who has spent the majority of his life in distant corners of the globe restoring antiquities. He spent 10 years in Syria before the civil war forced him out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a cadre of tradesmen who are able to return to Syria and cascade skills onto unskilled tradesmen,\u201d Steel said. \u201cSo that they can participate in a very meaningful way and have some sort of impact \u2026 on the restoration of the destroyed Syrian-built heritage.\u201d\n\nWafa'a Olimat delicately chisels a piece of stone at the U.S.-based World Monuments Fund's training program for conservation stonemasonry in Mafraq, Jordan. Annie Sakkab / for NBC News\n\nLooking at an ornamental piece that would be more at home in Rome than this dusty workshop, Steel notes it\u2019s from his most promising student, Mahmoud Rafeeq al Quasem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really quite wonderful,\u201d Steel said. \u201cThis has a degree of sophistication \u2026 but bear in mind this was just a chap who had a joinery workshop selling timber,\u201d he laughs. \u201cNo artistic training, nothing.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how long he has been in Jordan, al Quasem is quick to say the exact date he left his life in Homs \u2014 April 15, 2012. For six years he has lived within sight of the border. In another time he could have driven home in four hours. \u201cI want to be one of the first people back in Syria for the restoration,\u201d al Quasem said. \u201cBecause if we\u2019re not doing it, if we\u2019re not going to do it, I don\u2019t think anyone else will.\u201d\n\nUntil then, he's focused on his work.\n\n\u201cI have something internal that I need to bring out and I feel that I want to achieve something,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel it belongs to me. The stone belongs to me.\u201d\n\nNot all of the students are as skilled as al Quasem. What they do share is dedication. Every day from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. they alternate between masonry practice and classroom work on geometry, basic engineering and the history of Islamic architecture. Occasionally they take field trips to the many heritage sites that dot Jordan.\n\nOn a recent trip the group visited the 12th-century Ajloun Castle.

Annie Sakkab / for NBC News\n\nTo the west of the castle lies the Jordan River Valley and the West Bank. To the east is the desert and the stonemasonry school in Mafraq. And to the north, beyond the hills, lies Syria.\n\n'It's a beginning'\n\nSteel is quick to note that it is the human loss in Syria that is most important \u2014 more than 500,000 people have been killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. But it was the antiquities that made him and his partner, Stephen Battle, realize they could help.\n\n\u201cIt became clear even if money is available, even if the will is there to do conservation, to preserve what is remaining there, if there are no skilled people to carry out that work then it is simply not going to happen,\u201d said Battle, a World Monuments Fund program director.\n\n\u201cIt just will be easier to demolish the damaged buildings than preserve them.\u201d\n\nSyria has six sites on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List. Each has now been severely damaged or destroyed, but few sites fared worse than Aleppo. A recent survey by UNESCO found that 60 percent of the Old City has been severely damaged in the war. Thirty percent is completely destroyed.\n\nOwaish Jabra was 22 when she left Aleppo in 2012. She remembers the Great Mosque, with its shining marble courtyard and towering minaret. By 2013 the ground of the courtyard was littered with debris, with the surrounding porticoes scarred by bullet holes and singed black from fire. The 11th-century minaret was nothing but a pile of rubble in the corner.\n\nShe said that if you had seen Aleppo before the war, \"you will be too much hurting your heart\" looking at it now.\n\nSteel admits the training program is only a drop in the vast ocean of Syria's destruction. But even if the students don\u2019t make it back anytime soon, the classes provide a sense of purpose and routine while they remain in the refugee\u2019s purgatory.\n\nBritish archaeologist Tony Steele and project manager Stephen Battle during a field trip to the historic 12th-century Ajloun Castle in Jordan.

But even drinkers drowning their sorrows in Britain\u2019s pubs can\u2019t escape the national angst over Brexit.\n\nHigh-profile entrepreneur Tim Martin has taken the debate into his 1,000-strong chain of J.D. Wetherspoon pubs, printing pro-Brexit talking points on beer coasters.\n\nMartin\u2019s dressed-down, folksy image and hands-on reputation have earned him many supporters. He visits several of his pubs each week to check on everything from bar service to bathroom cleanliness.\n\nBut has Martin's stance on Britain\u2019s most divisive issue in memory left a bad taste in the mouth of some customers?\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware nobody has thrown down their pint and walked out into another pub,\u201d he told NBC News over a drink at his barn-like Shakespeare\u2019s Head pub in London\u2019s Holborn neighborhood. \u201cI think people on the whole have accepted that it\u2019s fair enough to have a debate.\"\n\nTwo years after the shock referendum result, the U.K. remains intractably divided on what Brexit should look like, or whether it should still go ahead at all.\n\nMartin, 63, wants Britain to push ahead and completely quit the European Union customs zone \u2014 a so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d that he believes would reduce the price of food for his drinkers.\n\nMany other British business leaders are opposed to that idea, but Martin says they are trying to fool the public.\n\n\u201cWe should be friends with Europe but get the hell out,\" he said.\n\nAmong customers in the Shakespeare\u2019s Head, not everyone knows who Martin is or cares what he thinks, but Brexit remains a raw topic.\n\n\u201cI just want to drink in peace,\" said Dennis Meleady, 63. \"I hear enough rubbish about politics in the news without getting it in here.\u201d\n\nThe retired carpenter voted for Brexit, but now has doubts that it will ever happen. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete mess,\u201d he said.\n\nBritain has already triggered the E.U.'s divorce mechanism and will leave the bloc in just 243 days\u2019 time on March 29, 2019.\n\nA poster backing Brexit outside a J.D.Wetherspoon pub in Dover, England.

It narrowly avoided a defeat in the House of Commons on one vote earlier this month, scraping by 305 to 302 to earn a narrow victory against the opposition.\n\nGrowing uncertainty at the impact on trade and customs has prompted some lawmakers from across the political spectrum to demand the process be subjected to a second vote or even abandoned altogether.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry wants Britain to retain some form of customs union that would allow \u201cfrictionless\u201d cross-border movement of goods to and from the U.K.\u2019s largest market, but May and her ministers say a no-deal \u201chard Brexit\u201d is increasingly likely.\n\nMartin said the passion on both sides of Brexit debate was reminiscent of the 1970s sectarian \u201cTroubles\u201d in Northern Ireland, where he grew up.\n\n\"It\u2019s amazing how people\u2019s emotions have been engaged,\" he said.\n\nThat's at least partially because many E.U. citizens living in Britain face an uncertain future, with their immigration status still unclear.\n\n\u201cMy parents are immigrants,\u201d said Daniel Varao, a security manager drinking a cold pint of cider. \u201cMy parents are from Portugal, they\u2019ve been here for more than 40 years. They\u2019ve paid their taxes, I was born here, my sister was born here. As every day comes closer to Brexit, the reality is kicking in. Will they be threatened with being kicked out of the country they\u2019ve been in for 40 years?\u201d\n\nDaniel Varao. Alastair Jamieson\n\nFlorian Radoi, a 31-year-old construction worker from Romania smoking a cigarette in the sunshine by the pub entrance, said: \u201cWho is going to do these jobs, if we are not here? We are thousands in London.\u201d\n\nBeer expert Pete Brown believes Martin has \u201cviolated the sanctity of the boozer\u201d by \u201cpoliticizing\u201d his watering holes.\n\n\"Some people do talk politics in the pub among themselves, but this Brexit campaign feels a bit like the bartender leaning over out of the blue and telling you what they think,\" he said. \"A great publican creates an environment where people feel relaxed and welcome. Having a strident view on an issue feels like that trust has been broken.\"\n\nHe added: \"My local Wetherspoon is one of the few places left where you see a real cross-section of the community \u2014 people of color, older people, students, shift workers \u2014 it is inclusive like a pub should be. That's why it rankles with me to see a political campaign.\"\n\nMartin thinks discussion is healthier than polite silence.\n\n\u201cI ardently believe in Brexit and in democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the great things about democracy is that it brings out debate, it brings out tremendous emotion and emotion is energy.\u201d\n\nThe J.D. Wetherspoon logo is displayed on a glass door at a pub in Hornchurch, England. Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nCertainly his stance has not harmed profits at J.D. Wetherspoon, which recorded strong growth in profits in the six months leading up to January.\n\nThe chain has a reputation for cheap drinks and a music-free, no-nonsense environment that, like Brexit, drinkers either love or hate.\n\nMartin founded his empire with a single pub in north London in 1979 and has steadily expanded as an outsider competing against Britain\u2019s complacent, brewery-controlled pubs.

When authorities get wise, the term is changed.\n\n\u201cI must have used the word 'game' more than 1,000 times in the last two years,\u201d the 25-year-old Nazeri said.\n\nZubair Nazeri at the Krnjaca refugee and migrant camp on the outskirts of Belgrade, Serbia, in June 2017. Marko Drobnjakovic\n\nThe smugglers also have code words for the police.\n\nWhen Nazeri dealt with Afghan smugglers at the beginning of his trip, they would refer to officers as \u201csaag,\u201d the Farsi word for dogs. Later, they were referred to by a made-up word pronounced \u201cma-ma-gan.\u201d\n\nA deadly industry\n\nAll entrepreneurs aim to drive down costs, keep their financial exposure to a minimum and build up capacity. When it comes to people smugglers, however, they often take significant physical risks that endanger the lives of their clients \u2014 migrants often fleeing danger at home.\n\nNazeri said children under the age of 4 were systematically spoon-fed sedatives to keep them from crying or making a noise. Smugglers, he said, would refuse to take young families who wouldn't administer them.\n\nNazeri explained how parents dissolved the sedatives in milk or water, often drugging their babies for days in a row. \u201cThe baby would sleep for 24 hours \u2014 sometimes more,\u201d he said.\n\nZubair Nazeri arrived in Germany last month. Vladimir Banic / for NBC News\n\nThe stakes were high. Had a child cried and revealed the group\u2019s presence in the woods, the \"game\" would be up and the family might have to pay a fee to the smuggler for the failed crossing, Nazeri explained.\n\nTwo Turkish smugglers in balaclavas who were helping to transport migrants across the Mediterranean Sea to Greece ordered Nazeri and his fellow travelers not to take their luggage and life jackets on the boat, to leave them ashore.\n\n\u201cHe said there was no need because it was safe and the boat may become too heavy,\u201d recalled Nazeri.\n\nAt another point, Nazeri said he spent four hours crammed in a car with 17 other people.\n\nThe dangerous practice of packing migrants into vehicles is nothing new. At the height of Europe's migration crisis in 2015, 71 people were found dead in an abandoned refrigerated truck in Austria.\n\nNazeri also found himself walking across the border from Bosnia-Herzegovina into Croatia in an area known to contain landmines left over from the 1992-95 war.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trust them to keep you safe,\u201d said Nazeri, referring to the smugglers. \u201cThey played with our lives.\u201d\n\nSecuring the cash\n\nAt the heart of Nazeri\u2019s journey is a shopping mall in downtown Kabul, where the basement of the Golbahar Center features many travel agents and currency exchange firms.\n\nIt is through one of these small offices that Nazeri transferred at least $8,000 in a series of payments to smugglers. \u201cWe can trust them and the smuggler can trust them,\u201d he said of the offices.\n\nThe Golbahar Center in Kabul, Afghanistan. Ahmed Mengli / NBC News\n\nThe mechanism is simple. Before any potential border crossing, Nazeri's brothers would send money to the exchange office with the instructions that the funds be held in escrow until the agent is given the go-ahead.\n\nHis family paid a fee of 50 euros ($59) to block the money each time, only releasing the funds after Nazeri called to inform them he had safely arrived. The smuggler also has to pay 50 euros to unblock his cash, giving the agent a cut of 100 euros ($118) for each transaction.\n\nDuring one of the later legs of his journey \u2014 which took Nazeri from Afghanistan through Iran, Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, France and finally to Germany \u2014 the smuggler did not take him as far as had been agreed. Nazeri told his brothers not to release the money.\n\n\"I didn't pay the money because he lied to me,\" he recalled.\n\nTuesday Reitano, deputy director of the Geneva-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime think tank and policy institute, said that people from other countries used different informal finance mechanisms. Syrians, for example, tend to leave the money with restaurant or hostel owners, she said.\n\n'It's like a travel agency service'\n\nNazeri said finding people smugglers was straightforward.\n\nHe met them either through recommendations from former smugglers, friends or at notorious hot spots such as Victoria Square in Athens.\n\nIn countries such as Afghanistan, where migration has become a cultural phenomenon, most people will have easy access to a people smuggler, according to Reitano's group.\n\n\"For a lot of the world, smuggling isn\u2019t a criminal business, it\u2019s like a travel agency service. It isn\u2019t heavily stigmatized and it isn't unsafe,\" Reitano added.\n\nMany European countries have strict requirements for Afghans hoping to travel. The German Embassy in Kabul, for example, does not accept visa applications, instead requiring would-be visitors to go to Pakistan, Dubai, India or Turkey for an appointment with an official.\n\nA friend introduced Nazeri to his first smuggler in a bar in Kabul. On reaching the Iranian capital of Tehran, he recommended another contact, who picked up Nazeri at the bus station and took him to his apartment.\n\nThe smugglers would often provide Nazaeri with shelter and food while they waited for an opportunity to cross the border. Nazeri sometimes paid rent, but on other occasions that was included in the overall price.\n\nThe recruiters or agents used by migrants outside of their home country tend to be of the same nationality, according to experts. Many are also former migrants.\n\n\u201cThey have knowledge of the culture and language and act as a kind of a bridge of trust for the people who are coming,\u201d said Rados Djurovic, director of the Asylum Protection Support League in Serbia.\n\nNazeri said he knew migrants who had started working as recruiters after running out of money. \u201cThey try and try to cross many times, then they decide to become smugglers,\u201d he said.\n\nZubair Nazeri stands inside his room at the Krnjaca refugee and migrant camp on the outskirts of Belgrade, Serbia, in June 2017. Marko Drobnjakovic / for NBC News\n\nDjurovic said that in Serbia \u2014 where Nazeri spent a year and a half \u2014 agents often met members of criminal networks in prison or through the black market to help smuggle migrants.\n\nNazeri said the drivers and guides who helped him cross borders tended to be local residents and were often teenagers. He said he believed the smugglers used underage people because they might face lighter punishment if arrested.\n\nCriminal syndicates\n\nBy the time Nazeri reached Greece, he had exhausted his list of recommended smugglers. As his journey progressed, he was forced to pick at random from the recruiters living among their potential customers in camps for asylum-seekers.\n\nNazeri's pace also slowed. It took him six attempts to traverse the Macedonian border and he was later trapped in Serbia for more than a year and a half, failing to cross the border into Croatia \u2014 and the European Union \u2014 10 times.\n\nArezo Malakooti, a researcher on migration to Europe and an expert in Afghanistan who also works for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said if a migrant has enough to pay one smuggler for the entire trip, the journey can usually be completed in a matter of days.\n\nBut if a migrant pays different smugglers for each leg, it can take a lot longer, she added.\n\nCriminal organizations are shifting their business models toward people smuggling because it is seen as low risk and highly profitable, said a Europol spokesman, Jan Op Gen Oorth.\n\nBeyond border crossings, the migrant-smuggling industry covers a broad range of criminal activities including document forgery, under-the-table money transfers and laundering.\n\nIt also often intersects with drug smuggling or the transportation of other illegal cargo, with some 46 percent of smuggling groups also active in a variety of criminal areas, according to Europol. (Nazeri says he has never smuggled drugs to pay for his passage.)\n\nMaking the case\n\nNazeri was arrested after entering Slovenia. He later escaped a camp with the help of a smuggler, who then drove him west to Italy. (The Schengen Agreement of 1995 allows borderless travel within its member states.)\n\nFrom Milan, Nazeri made his way through France and into Germany using public transportation. He is currently being held in a camp for migrants outside Dortmund. His asylum case hinges on his claim that his life would be in danger if he is forced to return to Afghanistan because he fell in love with a government official's wife.\n\nExperts say his experience is largely typical of many who use smugglers to get to the E.U. While Nazeri is aware that telling his story may affect his asylum process, he said he wanted to shed light on the criminal activities of the smugglers.\n\nEurope\u2019s migration crisis peaked in 2015 with the arrival of more than 1 million asylum-seekers, but the flow has since stemmed, with such claims falling to the tens of thousands so far this year. And less than 50 percent of asylum-seekers from Afghanistan had their claims approved and were given status in Germany last year, according to the European Asylum Support Office.\n\nNazeri arrived in Germany last month at a politically volatile time, with immigration threatening the future of Chancellor Angela Merkel and the fragile coalition government she heads.\n\nNazeri now wonders whether his journey to the West was worth it.\n\n\"I lost my mind, my energy, my money,\" he said. \"In my dreams I see the forest, the police, the smugglers, I cannot sleep. I would not risk it all again.\"\n\nVladimir Banic reported from Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia and Germany.

Its fighters have been battling American-led NATO forces to restore their version of strict Islamic law in the country since the U.S. invaded after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. More than 2,400 Americans have been killed during the war.\n\nThe Doha meeting participant said the gatherings were \"very friendly\" with \"tea and cookies\" being served.\n\nThe negotiator said security is \"very tight in and outside,\" with hotel staff not allowed to enter.\n\nAmid concerns about their own safety, the Taliban delegates are taking steps to not be identified by the intelligence services of Russia, China and Arab countries.\n\n\"We don\u2019t go to the hotel together,\" the negotiator told NBC News. \"We never go to the meeting place first. Once they [the Americans] reach the meeting place, then we go there one by one.

The first half of 2018 was its deadliest on record with 1,692 civilians killed, according to the United Nations. Thousands of Afghan forces have also died in the conflict.\n\nThe Taliban is widely seen to have the upper hand or at least reached a stalemate versus a weak and divided government in Kabul and foreign backers weary of war.

Brinley Bruton and Wajjeh Abu Zarifa\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 Before the bullet tore through his left leg, Hadad Gamry knew that he was venturing too close to the razor-wire fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel.\n\nBut the 20-year-old wanted the world to know how angry he was, so Gamry says he taunted the soldiers on the other side anyway. That decision resulted in him becoming a statistic \u2014 one of the more than 13,000 Palestinians protesters injured near the barrier since March 30. At least 142 demonstrators have also been killed by Israeli troops, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\n\u201cNo electricity, no clean water, no open borders \u2014 this is how we in Gaza live,\u201d he told NBC News from a bed in al-Shifa, the main hospital in the blockaded seaside enclave. \u201cWe want the world to know about all our problems.\u201d\n\nPropped up on a pillow, the skin was pulled so tight over Gamry's purple-brown foot that the swollen flesh looked ready to burst. Doctors have told him if he doesn\u2019t receive permission to travel to Israel for specialized treatment they will likely have to amputate part of his leg.\n\n\u201cWhy did we go to the fence? We are trying to change our lives \u2014 we want a state,\u201d the high school student added while surrounded by fellow patients at the hospital\u2019s orthopedic unit, all of them among the more than 3,600 protesters wounded by Israeli bullets near the barrier. \u201cWe want to live a dignified life, but we are losing hope.\u201d\n\nHadad Gamry, 20, was shot in the leg last month while protesting at the fence separating Israel and Gaza. David Copeland / NBC News\n\nGamry was wounded on May 14, the deadliest day of the \u201cGreat March of Return\u201d demonstrations, in which Palestinians demanded the right to enter into Israel and reclaim homes lost after the country was founded in 1948.\n\nThe idea took off in the impoverished Palestinian enclave where 70 percent of the population are refugees or descendants of refugees. A similar proportion in Gaza depends on humanitarian aid.\n\nThat tens of thousands knowingly risked being shot by Israeli forces speaks to the growing desperation on this narrow, blockaded 25-mile strip of land.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s special adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is in the Middle East this week trying to craft an international aid package to alleviate the suffering. The plan is widely thought to be a precursor to the president\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century\u201d aimed at a long-term resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIsrael maintains that Hamas, the Islamist group controlling the enclave that many countries consider a terrorist organization, has encouraged civilians to put themselves in harm\u2019s way and then used them as cover to commit violence.\n\nA Palestinian boy protests near the barrier between the Gaza Strip and Israel on May 14. Mahmud Hams / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nGamry and others NBC News spoke to in Gaza rejected the idea that Hamas had compelled them to go to the fence, saying they went because they had run out of ways to make the world pay attention to their suffering.\n\n\u201cIt is Israel that is shooting us, not Hamas,\" said Gamry, shaking his finger for emphasis. \"We went to the protests willingly.\"\n\nAsma Abu Daqa, a mother of three whose right leg was shattered by an Israeli bullet when she ventured too close to the barrier, felt the same way.\n\n\u201cNobody pushed us to go \u2014 we went because we believe in our rights,\u201d she said from the European Gaza Hospital in Rafah, the bolts of a metal frame slicing into her right shin. \u201cI want a future for my children.\u201d\n\nAsma Abu Daqa with her husband, Mohammed, and her baby son, Amir, while being treated in hospital. David Copeland / NBC News\n\nAbu Daqa said the blockade, the Israeli occupation of ancestral lands, the constant threat of violence and a crushing loss of hope all fueled the Palestinian protests.\n\nSo she ignored warnings from Israeli forces via flyers and loudspeakers not to go near the soldiers and the fence on May 14. Abu Daqa, 24, said she took a stand by using her body to face down Israeli troops.\n\n\u201cMy son at 7 has seen two wars,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to see another, and for that I am willing to pay a price.\u201d\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three conflicts in the last 12 years \u2014 the latest in 2014. There is a growing sense that another war is inevitable.\n\nSome 30 rockets and mortar shells were fired by militants late Tuesday and early Wednesday into Israel, which responded with airstrikes.\n\nThe pervasive threat of violence backs up the land, sea and air blockade imposed in 2007. Hamas won elections the previous year and then seized control of the enclave in a power struggle with rival Fatah.\n\nIsraeli observation balloons hover over the 226-square-mile territory\u2019s periphery, and snipers\u2019 nests and towers for remote-controlled machine guns squat near the fence. It is often impossible to escape the persistent hum of Israeli drones.\n\nEconomically, the blockade is making life intolerable for many of Gaza\u2019s 2 million residents. Almost none of the water is clean, raw sewage is pumped straight into the sea and worsening power shortages mean Gazans have electricity for only around four hours a day on average. Unemployment rates are close to 50 percent \u2014 more than 65 percent among those under 30.\n\nAnd political impasse rules the lives of those in Gaza.\n\nChildren play in the street in Gaza City. David Copeland / NBC News\n\nIsrael and much of the world officially refuses to deal with Hamas and long-term talks aimed at creating an independent Palestinian state including Gaza, the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem \u2014 which Israel captured in 1967 \u2014 have stalled. Infighting among Hamas and Fatah, the dominant West Bank political party, have severely compromised Palestinian bargaining power.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that tens of thousands of protesters repeatedly gathered in camps along the fence with Israel.\n\nIsraeli officials worried that demonstrators would break through and carry out \u201cswarming\u201d attacks. An estimated 40,000 were protesting on May 14 when Israeli forces opened fire along the barrier, killing 60 Palestinians and wounding 2,700 others. Hamas later said that 50 of the fatalities were members.\n\nThe deadliest rally to date coincided with the inauguration of the American Embassy in Jerusalem \u2014 a move that dismayed and infuriated Palestinians.\n\nIsrael's military said rocks, \"firebombs and explosive devices\u201d were thrown toward the fence, which stretches for 40 miles.\n\nBut Israel's use of deadly force against demonstrators, journalists and health workers provoked an international outcry.\n\n\"The mere fact of approaching a fence is not a lethal, life-threatening act, so that does not warrant being shot,\" the U.N. international body\u2019s human rights spokesman, Rupert Colville, said last month. \"It seems that anyone is liable to be shot dead.\"\n\nInternational law states that \"lethal force may only be used as a measure of last, not first, resort,\" he added.\n\nLast week, the U.N. General Assembly condemned Israel for excessive use of force. On Tuesday, the U.S. withdrew from the U.N. Human Rights Council, citing unfair treatment of Israel.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the U.S. cut funding for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees by millions of dollars. The U.S. is the organization\u2019s largest donor.\n\nSo Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, have their work cut out for them.\n\nMohammed Yassim, a truck driver, said he had many reasons to protest even if he risked his life.\n\n\u201cYes, my life is important, but I can\u2019t take it outside the context of everything else here in Gaza,\u201d he said as he recovered from a bullet wound in his right leg in Al-Shifa Hospital. \u201cI cannot talk about my personal life without talking also about all the other things, like the Holy Land, and basic things like water, electricity and freedom of movement.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOur problem is not with Israel, it is with the occupation.\u201d\n\nYasser Abu Jamei, the executive head of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program, and his son Mohammed. David Copeland / NBC News\n\nThe blockade and related economic and social hardship has provoked a mental health crisis among Gazans, according to Yasser Abu Jamei, the executive head of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program \u2014 the largest independent mental health network here.\n\nBudget cuts to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, severe poverty, the lack of political resolution and the constant fear of violence are breeding despair and deep anger, he said.\n\n\u201cAll the news coming from all sides is basically terrible,\u201d Abu Jamei said. \"People are under pressure all the time.\"\n\nWhen the U.S. \u2014 a big, powerful and trusted government \u2014 moved the embassy to Jerusalem, Abu Jamei said many here perceived it as \"like telling the Palestinians to go to hell.\"\n\nHamas appears ready to play the long game, staying in power and waiting out Israel and the U.S. at any cost.\n\nBasem Naim is a senior Hamas official. David Copeland / NBC News\n\nGreenblatt has stated that Hamas must disarm and recognize Israel if it wants to play a role in a future Palestinian government, but Hamas has so far made no such commitment.\n\n\"If the stronger one cannot defeat the weaker, [the stronger] is defeated,\u201d senior Hamas official Basem Naim told NBC News. \u201cAnd if the weaker one does not surrender, he is not defeated.\u201d\n\nThe former Hamas health minister added: \u201cAnd we are not surrendering. As long as we are not raising the white flag, you cannot say that Israel has won the war.\u201d\n\nNaim said that even if some of those protesting at the fence were members of Hamas or another militant group operating in Gaza, they were entitled to be treated as legitimate demonstrators as long as they did not bring weapons with them.\n\n\u201cMost of those young people who are going to the fence have nothing to lose,\u201d he said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/communist-era-secret-police-files-reopen-old-wounds-albania-n884946", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Collaborate with us, they said, and we can let this whole thing go.\n\nIt was 1978, the height of Albania's dictatorship. Velo, then 43, knew that such deals were struck all the time. But \"this was something I just couldn\u2019t do,\" he recalled.\n\nVelo, a painter, was told that his art was anti-Socialist, that it expressed \u201cmodernist tendencies.\u201d\n\nMaks Velo. Rebecca Davis / for NBC News\n\nHe was interrogated for six months and says he was held in isolation and secured with chains. Velo was later put on trial and sentenced to 10 years of hard labor under a Soviet-style \"agitation and propaganda\" law.\n\nVelo was assigned to work in the copper mines and spent most of his seven years, three months and 10 days behind bars alongside other political prisoners in Spa\u00e7 Prison \u2014 part of a network built to mirror Stalin\u2019s gulags.\n\nFor the last four decades, Velo has wondered if he ended up in Spa\u00e7 because someone he knew took a deal like the one he was offered \u2014 and gave information about him to the authorities. He even imagined what such a person might have said.\n\nLast year, Albania's government opened up the archives of its old secret police, the Sigurimi. Anyone who was spied on during the Communist period can get access to his or her file, allowing those who collaborated with the regime to potentially be identified.\n\nPart of the former Spa\u00e7 prison in Shkoder, Albania. Gent Shkullaku / AFP/Getty Images file\n\nVelo requested his file, but then struggled to get through it. Sometimes he would start reading but have to abandon a page halfway through. There had been, he learned, about 20 people who had informed on him, among them a close friend and his former mother-in-law.\n\n\u201cMaks Velo is a person of bourgeois beliefs,\u201d she had written in a report to the secret police, according to the file. \u201cHe is a person with no character.\u201d\n\n'Things that they need to forgive'\n\nMost other former Communist countries opened up their Cold War-era files long ago.\n\nBut unlike many of its neighbors, Albania never carried out a policy of \u201clustration\u201d: a systematic purge of government officials who had participated in crimes during Communist times.\n\nToday, the Sigurimi files fill a series of small rooms in a government warehouse on the edges of Tirana. With files overflowing from metal shelves and in boxes stacked on the ground and windowsills, it\u2019s hard to say exactly how complete the collection is. Sigurimi agents are thought to have destroyed thousands of files during the last years of the regime.\n\nAlbania has opened to the public the files of the infamous Sigurimi secret police. Gent Shkullaku / AFP/Getty Images file\n\n\u201cEvery day, people come here, typically with questions that haven\u2019t been answered for a long time,\u201d says Gentina Sula, the director of the agency that provides access to the files. \u201cIf there are things that they need to forgive, for themselves or for their parents, I think this is a good chance. Very often, you know, a collaborator and a victim were in the same circle.\u201d\n\nSula\u2019s own grandfather was among the Albanians who were \"disappeared\" by government agents during the dictatorship. Almost three decades later, around 4,000 people are still listed as missing.\n\nThe Balkan nation of around 3 million people was once home to one of the most brutal regimes in the world. Some experts have compared Communist-era Albania to North Korea, because its borders were sealed with electric fences and Albanians were executed for trying to escape.\n\nDictator Enver Hoxha came to power at the end of World War II and served as head of state until his death in 1985. Known for being paranoid, he erected thousands of concrete bunkers to protect against a foreign invasion that never came.\n\nEnver Hoxha in 1946. Bettmann / Getty file\n\nUnder Hoxha's leadership, religion, long hair, coarse language and private cars were banned, as was criticism of the regime. If a person was judged to be a dissenter, the whole family could be sent to toil in faraway factories or fields.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1991, some 6,000 people were executed, according to Albania\u2019s Association of Former Political Prisoners. Tens of thousands were imprisoned or sent to labor camps on political charges.\n\nThe Sigurimi secret police force was notoriously efficient.\n\nSigurimi agents were sometimes called \u201cliving microphones,\u201d because they were always listening. But that reputation was made possible by thousands of ordinary Albanians who helped them, working as official collaborators, and thousands more who functioned as more casual informants, offering up intimate secrets about those they knew. The machinery of the Communist apparatus relied on whisper networks of compromised people.\n\nAs the dictatorship crumbled in the early 1990s, most Sigurimi agents slipped into anonymity.\n\nOne former official, Nesti Vako, agreed to speak with NBC News at a caf\u00e9 in central Tirana.\n\n\u201cAs the operational technical chief of the Sigurimi, I produced whatever technology they needed,\u201d said Vako, who spent 25 years as a chief engineer. Vako says that Sigurimi agents had the whole country bugged, with listening devices in coffee shops, offices and throughout all foreign embassies.\n\nIf the Sigurimi was targeting a woman, agents might study her shoes and then make a replica pair with a bug in the heel \u2014 and then swap them out without her noticing. Vako says he was sent to China once, to study surveillance techniques.\n\n\u201cI liked it a lot,\u201d Vako says, of his role. \u201cI feel very proud about my work. \u2026 I was lucky to have this job and I only applied the law.\u201d\n\nAsked what he thought about the public release of Sigurimi files, Vako shook his head.\n\n\u201cLook, opening the files, in my personal opinion, is tricky. It\u2019s not a good thing,\" he said. \"The reason is that if you look at the files, there are cases where a brother spied on his brother.\u201d\n\nPatriots or traitors?\n\nVelo's Sigurimi file is 250-pages long, and it has taken him several months to understand it. Collaborators were given code names, so Velo has had to reverse-engineer the evidence \u2014 thinking back to events long ago, to figure out who the pseudonyms could refer to.\n\nHis friend\u2019s collaboration haunts the 83-year-old Velo the most. The man was a fellow painter, someone Velo used to invite into his home. When Velo was arrested, authorities declared his works to be hostile and burned many of his paintings.\n\nMaks Velo at his home in Tirana, Albania. Rebecca Davis / for NBC News\n\n\u201cHow could I have imagined that discussing art works is a criminal offense?\u201d he said.\n\nAfter he got his file, Velo learned that the friend was still alive and living in Tirana, but he didn\u2019t try to reach him.\n\nSula, the official in charge of the Sigurimi archives, said she's concerned that people living in Albania today won't understand the context in which choices were made, or not made, under the dictatorship. Her agency has received hundreds of requests for files.\n\n\u201cIt was a society taken hostage,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a lot of propaganda.\"\n\nShe said many collaborators believed they were \"serving their country\" and being \"patriotic,\" while others were coerced.\n\nSo does how does Sula think former collaborators should be treated today?\n\n\u201cSympathy is a big word,\u201d Sula says. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say sympathy. But I call for people to do deep analysis.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Velo says he doesn\u2019t regret reading his file, but he doesn\u2019t feel much sense of closure either.\n\n\u201cAmericans say, \u2018Sorry, sorry\u2019 100 times a day,\u201d he says. \u201cHere, nobody ever says, \u2018Forgive me.\u2019\u201d"}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/cyprus-turns-taps-farmers-fresh-water-levels-drop-n881871", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Even cactuses are struggling to survive.\n\nBut there are few easy fixes as this island nation of almost 1.2 million people faces the looming reality of life without fresh water.\n\nCyprus and other countries in the eastern Mediterranean are increasingly vulnerable to drought as the changing climate brings higher temperatures and less precipitation, according to Petteri Taalas, the general secretary of the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nReservoirs behind dams are at just 21.9 percent of capacity across Cyprus.\n\nThe reservoir behind the Kouris dam \u00ad\u2014 the largest in the country \u2014 is down to just 16.7 percent of its capacity. Petros Karadjias / for NBC News\n\nThe government here imposed restrictions on using water for irrigation this month. The move was unpopular with farmers, but officials say it is the only way to prevent the reservoirs from running dry before the end of the year.\n\nTaps continue to flow in urban areas because of a supply of more costly potable water that has been transformed from seawater by four desalination facilities.\n\n\u201cThis is not enough,\u201d said Theodoulos Mesimeris, a climate-change expert with the country's environment ministry.\n\nThe semi-arid country is accustomed to periods of drought, but Mesimeris said the frequency of these dry conditions is expected to increase over the next decade. At the same time, demand for water has increased because of a growing urban population and booming tourism sector.\n\n\u201cThe needs we have today, they are very different from the past,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult issue to handle.\u201d\n\n'I don't think they have a future'\n\nDead grass crunches beneath Christoforou\u2019s feet as he walks through the farm he inherited from his father in 2015. Despite the challenges of a changing climate, he said he remains optimistic that the business will be sustainable.\n\nThe 34-year-old mechanical engineer said he\u2019s trying everything to reduce his costs and keep up production.\n\nHe has access to public water, but it costs twice as much as pumping from his own boreholes. That's become an expensive necessity now that his wells have started drawing salt water as the Mediterranean leaches into the barren aquifers below.\n\nTo deal with the lack of rain, Christoforou said he\u2019s stopped tilling the soil to lock in moisture, makes mulch out of the dead grass and twigs to diminish the sun\u2019s rays, and uses natural traps to keep insects away.\n\nIn addition to dry conditions, extreme weather is also taking a toll. Christoforou\u2019s attempts to grow grapes were dashed by rare hailstorms that hit the island in the first few days of June. The Ministry of Agriculture said that resulted in nearly 100 percent losses for some crops.\n\nCharis Christoforou Petros Karadjias / for NBC News\n\nChristoforou sees tourism as a potential revenue stream to support his struggling organic farm. He plans to build villas on the property where tourists can stay to taste his organic olive oil, honey and herbs and learn about sustainable farming practices.\n\nBut he\u2019s less certain about the island's agriculture industry as a whole. Christoforou said he\u2019s the only organic farmer in the area. Neighboring farms continue tilling their soil, increasing the risk for erosion when rains come in sudden sweeps.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have a future,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t change their ways to be more eco-friendly, they will have problems.\u201d\n\nDesalination\n\nAdriana Bruggeman, a professor of hydrology and water management at the Cyprus Institute, a research organization, said no matter what civilians do to conserve water, there is simply not enough of the natural resource to fill the need.\n\nBut most of the 3.65 million sun-seekers who visited the island last year \u2014 including 1.25 million from the United Kingdom \u2014 were most likely oblivious to the crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like Cape Town,\u201d she said, referring to the South African city\u2019s crisis this year, which forced residents to forgo regular showers and flushing toilets. \u201cIn the cities, for tourism, nobody will notice.\u201d\n\nCyprus has learned to manage drought through experience. A similar crisis in 2008 forced the country to import water on tankers from Greece.\n\nYiannis Papazoglou, a mechanical engineer with the country\u2019s water development department who was involved with bringing water in from abroad, said he hopes that scenario won\u2019t be repeated.\n\nThe reservoir behind the Kouris dam \u00ad\u2014 the largest in the country \u2014 is down to just 16.7 percent of its capacity. Papazoglou said that is better than a decade ago, when the volume of water dropped to well below 1 percent.\n\nBy restricting the use of water for agriculture, he said the department is ensuring there is enough water for this year and next if drought conditions persist.\n\nThe nearby city of Limassol is supported by a desalination plant that converts around 10.6 million gallons of water daily. The facility is operated privately and the water is then sold to the government and distributed.\n\nAn abandoned church towers over the Kouris dam near Limassol, Cyprus. Petros Karadjias / for NBC News\n\nA half-mile pipe sucks in water from the Mediterranean Sea, filtering out as much debris as possible, explains Giannis Gounarides, a mechanical engineer with operator MN Limassol Water Co. The water then works its way through a complex filtration system developed by Israel\u2019s national water company, Mekorot, that includes reverse osmosis and the addition of minerals and chlorine for taste and safety.\n\nThe water costs about 85 cents per cubic meter (264 gallons) \u2014 much higher than the 10 to 12 cents it costs to treat and distribute the same amount of fresh water.\n\nSuffering crops\n\nThe government turned off the taps to seasonal crops this month, meaning significant losses for farmers.\n\nPermanent crops, like trees that are harder to replace when they die, are receiving roughly 25 percent of their water needs simply to keep plants alive.\n\nThe Riverland Dairy Bio Farm is in the center of the island, roughly 30 miles from the south coast. Vassilis Kyprianou raises goats and sheep and produces hay and seasonal crops in greenhouses there.\n\nA small dam near a farm in Kampia, Cyprus. Petros Karadjias / for NBC News\n\nTo support his own water needs, Kyprianou has three boreholes and captures rainwater in two massive tanks. Without regular rain, the tanks are getting low and crops are suffering.\n\nKyprianou said he produced 55 percent less hay compared with years when rain is adequate. It means he\u2019ll have to import feed from overseas \u2014 at a 35 percent higher cost than growing it himself.\n\nPumping groundwater is also becoming more expensive as the diesel required for the job increases in price, he said. \u201cI worry about this, but I\u2019m always positive,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe nature can make the balance, but we need people to have a vision.\u201d\n\nKyprianou wants to see the government prioritize the agriculture sector. He said less water should be allocated for tourism areas and conservation practices like what he\u2019s implemented at his property could be scaled nationally. \u201cWe could collect water at each house,\u201d he said.\n\n'The most hated person in Cyprus'\n\nPambos Hajipakkos, the country\u2019s chief water officer, acknowledges there is plenty of criticism of the government's efforts to mitigate the crisis. \u201cThere is no way I can keep everybody happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI was told by a friend of mine that these days I\u2019m the most hated person in Cyprus.\u201d\n\nDeciding who gets water and how much is a delicate calculation that considers economic and social issues, Hajipakkos said.\n\nFarmers argue they have international contracts they must deliver on and their own livelihoods to maintain, but tourism is a far bigger contributor to the country\u2019s economy. Agriculture represented just 2 percent of the country\u2019s GDP in 2016, while tourism\u2019s direct and indirect contributions amounted to 21.4 percent.\n\nAyia Napa is a popular destination for tourists. Patrick Baz / AFP/Getty Images file\n\nThere are also practical considerations when choosing what initiatives to implement. \u201cWould shutting down all the swimming pools really make a difference?\u201d Hajipakkos asked.\n\nNegotiations are underway to expand the capacity of the Limassol desalination plant to produce an extra 5.3 million gallons of water daily. With that increase, Hajipakkos said the city could function without any rainfall.\n\nThe construction of a fifth plant on the island is also up for bid for the Paphos region. Long term, Hajipakkos said he wants major pipelines built to better connect the water system across the country in case one of the plants breaks down.\n\n\u201cThings happen,\" he said. \"Your air conditioner goes wrong midsummer. Desalination plants go out of operation because they need maintenance or something happens.\"\n\nThe desalination plant in Episkopi, Cyprus.

Farmers are also being encouraged to shift toward more drought-resistant crops.\n\nHajippakos said he\u2019d like to see heftier fees for homes that use high amounts of water to create incentives for conservation.\n\n\u201cYou have to adjust with what you have,\u201d he said."}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/aquarius-ordeal-highlights-hardening-views-migrants-europe-n892691", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The Aquarius was eventually welcomed by Spain.\n\nItalian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said the country was saying \"no to the business of clandestine immigration.\"\n\nAuthorities in Rome have since barred several other similar rescue ships carrying migrants from disembarking on Italian soil.\n\nThe policy change raises questions about how rescue ships manned by volunteers who have traditionally been at the forefront of saving lives will be able to continue their work. Around 27,000 migrants have died while trying to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea since 1993.\n\nThe Aquarius Christophe Petit Tesson / EPA file\n\nSalvini has regularly accused rescue vessels of complicity with smugglers \u2014 who often pack migrants into overcrowded and rickety boats. He also once declared that crews of humanitarian rescue ships \u201cshould be arrested\u201d and their vessels \u201csunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Aquarius made visible something that has been happening for a few months, which is the attempt to criminalize the role of NGOs in search and rescue operations,\u201d said Nando Sigona, a researcher in migration at the University of Birmingham, using a British acronym for non-governmental organizations.\n\nLast month was the deadliest in the past four years in the central Mediterranean route between North Africa and Italy, with some 563 people dead or missing, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). There have been more than 250 additional fatalities on this route this month.\n\nItaly is on the front line of Europe\u2019s migration crisis. Bing Maps\n\nBut last week, a Spanish aid group accused Libya's coast guard of abandoning a woman and toddler to their deaths after they intercepted a boat carrying 160 people 90 nautical miles off the Libyan coast.\n\nAlina Krobok deputy spokesperson for Sea-Watch, a non-profit group which conducts search-and-rescue operations from Malta, said it was becoming increasingly difficult for humanitarian organizations to save migrants from drowning in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to stop rescue boats from doing their jobs,\u201d said Krobok. \u201cThere is a definite relationship between us not being out there and people dying.\"\n\nItaly has taken hundreds of thousands of migrants in recent years as one of the southern European countries on the front line of Europe\u2019s migration crisis. However, fewer people are arriving. The number of detected illegal border crossings into the E.U. has fallen by 95 percent from its peak in October 2015, according to the European Council.\n\nWhile Italy\u2019s new coalition government had vowed to take a hard-line approach to migration, Salvini's decision to refuse the Aquarius access to his country's ports translated that rhetoric into action.\n\n\u201cThis is Salvini keeping election promises,\u201d said Craig Damian Smith, associate director of the Global Migration Lab at the University of Toronto.\n\nHe added that the new Italian approach could bankrupt some humanitarian organizations because the vessels will now have to spend more time at sea because nearby Italian ports are no longer an option.\n\n\"It costs something like $30,000 a day to run one of these vessels and these are NGOs which survive off donations,\" Smith said.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Euronews' @AnneliseBorges tells the extraordinary story of the Aquarius in a behind-the-scenes documentary filmed on board the migrant ship that divided Europe.\n\n\n\nWatch the full video: https://t.co/SX07LxnvAv pic.twitter.com/iqNutVEXCo \u2014 euronews (@euronews) July 17, 2018\n\nPaul Dillon, a spokesperson for IOM, said the decreased presence of rescue ships may be a factor contributing to the high number of deaths but said there were too many variables to make \"cause and effect conclusions.\"\n\nItaly\u2019s increasing hostility to rescue boats, combined with political crisis in Germany linked to migration, has shot the issue back to the top of Europe\u2019s agenda.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel opened her country's borders to welcome around 1 million asylum-seekers in 2015.

Today, he is an Islamic State terrorist.\n\nWith ISIS driven from much of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, Umaima has joined a growing number of the militants' wives who are filing for divorce.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, Umaima said. Her community looks down on divorced women. She is also sad that her three children, aged 6 to 12, are growing up without a dad.\n\n\"I was and still am disappointed because I married a man who didn't appreciate his life and decided to join a terrorist group instead of taking care of his family,\" said Umaima, who is relying on the support of her parents as she navigates life as a single mother. \"I will try to be their father as well.\"\n\nDeputy Justice Minister Hussein Jassem said that there has been \"a huge increase\" in requests for divorce in the last three months across Iraq \u2014 with the vast majority filed by women.\n\nWhile the government has not tracked the number of ISIS-related divorces, there has been a notable uptick in applications in Sunni Muslim regions such as Anbar and Nineveh where the group was strong, Jassem added.\n\nUmaima said her husband's transformation came in 2010, after Iraqi security forces accused his brother of being a militant and fatally tortured him.\n\n\"My husband got mad and he swore he would take revenge on his brother's killers,\" Umaima told NBC News in a phone interview from Fallujah. Like other women NBC News spoke to, Umaima asked to be identified by only her first name out of fear of being stigmatized.\n\nA woman carries a child in a street in Mosul, Iraq, as troops battled to retake the area from ISIS fighters in April 2017. Christophe Simon / AFP - Getty Images\n\nHer husband, Awad, joined ISIS after it swept across Iraq in 2014, Umaima said. He was later arrested and faces life in prison or a death sentence if convicted.\n\nDespite the emotional hardship, Umaima, 41, said divorce is better than the alternative.\n\n\"Being the wife of a terrorist is not honoring me or my family and it is not going to honor my kids,\" she said.\n\nWhile some conservative Sunni Muslim communities, including those where the women in this story live, are not in favor of divorce, it is accepted by many in Iraq and is not considered a sin under Islam. Both men and women can apply for divorce through the courts.\n\nIraqi women are free to request a divorce on a variety of grounds, including if their husband mistreated them or were convicted of crimes.\n\nSpouses applying for a divorce have to provide evidence supporting their claims, such as sworn statements from witnesses. A case doesn't require a lawyer, is generally inexpensive and a decision is typically issued about a month after an application is filed.\n\nAccording to Belkis Wille, senior Iraq researcher for Human Rights Watch, one judge in Mosul \u2014 the country's second-largest city and a former ISIS stronghold \u2014 reported that dozens of women were now trying to dissolve their marriages each week.\n\nA divorce allows women the opportunity to remarry and erases the lingering stain of having an insurgent ex-husband, Wille added.\n\nThe stigma of being linked to ISIS runs deep in Iraq. A report released by New York-based Human Rights Watch this year said some families being held in displacement camps were unable to return to their communities because of alleged affiliation to the militant group.\n\nThe Iraqi government has also encouraged the public to tip off officials about anyone who is a potential ISIS supporter in order for them to be investigated and tried. Jassem, the deputy justice minister, said only wives of ISIS militants who cooperated with the terrorist group would face prosecution.\n\nBut Human Rights Watch's Wille said that while flagging suspects brought some militants to justice, the process has also resulted in some people embroiled in feuds of being falsely accused of being ISIS supporters.\n\nCivilians from Mosul wait after arriving in a camp for those displaced during the offensive to retake the city from ISIS in March 2017. Ahmad Al-Rubaye / AFP - Getty Images\n\nFatima, 35, has joined the ranks of those seeking a divorce.\n\nShe said she was surprised when her husband, Omar, joined ISIS after having served as soldier in the Iraqi army before the 2003 U.S. invasion.\n\nHe was arrested three years ago when security forces liberated the city of Tikrit from the militants, according to Fatima.\n\n\"I am afraid of being accused that I support terrorism, and this is one of the reasons that drove me to ask for divorce,\" Fatima said.\n\nShaima'a shares such concerns. She doesn't know if her husband is hiding, arrested or dead.\n\nShe married Abdulqader five years ago while he owned a supermarket in their town of Heet, northwest of Baghdad. He was later lured by ISIS promises to uphold \"true\" Islam, according to Shaima'a.\n\nShaima'a, 26, said Abdulqader eventually realized his mistake and wanted to leave the group \"but he couldn't do that because they would kill him.\"\n\nHe went missing when Iraqi forces began the campaign to liberate Heet and hasn't been heard from since.\n\nShaima'a said she would like to remarry if given the opportunity.\n\n\"It's not that easy,\" she added. \"I don't want to live the rest of my life as a wife without a husband.\""}, {"source": "nbc", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/iceland-is-for-gun-lovers-but-nobody-gets-shot-1283273283910", "text": "Iceland is for gun lovers (but nobody gets shot) 03:08 copied!\n\nIcelandic people love guns.

Along with other Palestinians in the West Bank, Christians face land seizures, arbitrary detentions and collective punishment that are part and parcel of the Israeli occupation, residents and rights groups say.\n\nIn January, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, warned that \u201cradical settler groups\u201d threatened Christians in the Holy Land.

Dusan Vranic / for NBC News\n\nAmerican evangelicals surged onto the political scene in 1980 by helping to elect President Ronald Reagan. In 2016, around 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Trump.\n\nAs evangelicals grew more prominent domestically, their ties to the Israeli political establishment strengthened.\n\nThe International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, Israel's largest charity, is funded largely by American evangelicals. Since being founded in 1983, it has raised a total of $1.5 billion with the help of evangelical leaders including the Rev. Pat Robertson, the prominent televangelist.\n\nThe Rev. Robert Jeffress, the influential pastor of the 13,000-member First Baptist church in Dallas and an informal adviser to Trump, explains evangelicals' stalwart support of Israel this way: \u201cThe Bible says this land belongs to the Jewish people \u2014 period.\"\n\nHe added, \"God has pronounced judgment after judgment in the Old Testament to those who would \u2018divide the land,\u2019 endquote, and hand it over to non-Jews.\u201d\n\nA carpet showing the Last Supper on sale in Jerusalem's Old City.

With Vienna widely regarded as the spying capital of the world, that has serious implications for Washington and its allies.\n\nOne factor is at the heart of these concerns: the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) \u2014 which is openly supportive of Russia.\n\n\"Austria is economically and politically integrated in the West, but the FP\u00d6 is trying to play the card of being part of the East,\" says Gustav Gressel, a former desk officer at the Austrian Ministry of Defense. \"If you have an East-West confrontation, you basically have parts of your enemy behind your own lines.\"\n\nFounded by former Nazis in the 1950s, the FP\u00d6 has been a junior member of the country's coalition government since December. As part of that deal, it was given responsibility for Austria's defense and interior ministries, and with them the domestic and military intelligence services.\n\n\"We have to take the side of Russia,\" Alexander Markovics said. Christian Wind / for NBC News\n\nThe FP\u00d6 won 26 percent of the vote in last year's legislative elections by deploying anti-establishment, anti-immigrant populist rhetoric that was condemned by opponents as racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic.\n\nThe party and its leading figures are also unashamedly fans of Putin. The idea of a pro-Russia party controlling intelligence services has led to fears that Western secrets aren't safe any more if shared with Vienna.\n\n\"Austria is part of the European Union defense policy, and whatever is agreed and discussed there will be leaked to Moscow,\" predicts Gressel, who is now a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.\n\n\"The issue is trust and mistrust,\" says Siegfried Beer, a leading espionage expert at the Austrian Center for Intelligence, Propaganda and Security Studies, who added that in terms of security and dealing with partners, giving the FP\u00d6 control of the intelligence services \"was not the best solution.\"\n\nAustria's tradition as a playground for espionage dates back to the 19th century and was immortalized in the 1949 film, \"The Third Man.\" Spying is legal here unless it's against the Austrian state itself.\n\nVienna's reputation as a den of spies dates to the 19th century. Christian Wind / for NBC News\n\nIt was therefore no coincidence that Vienna was the venue for a high-profile spy swap between the U.S. and Russia in 2010 involving renowned Russian agent Anna Chapman.\n\nThe country's neutral status \u2014 neither part of NATO nor allied to Russia \u2014 means it's home to a large number of nongovernmental and international organizations. Experts say many diplomats working in the city are actually spies, with Beer and others estimating the number at around 7,000.\n\n'It stinks to high heaven'\n\nThe FP\u00d6 is not shy about its affection for Russia.\n\nIn 2016, party leader Heinz-Christian Strache signed a formal \"cooperation pact\" with Putin's United Russia party \u2014 unprecedented for a mainstream political group in Western Europe.\n\nIt was not just symbolic. After the deal, the parties agreed to \"reinforce the links between our parties and countries, including in the field of international security,\" according to United Russia politician Sergei Zheleznyak.\n\n\"There's a cause for concern,\" says William Eacho, who served as U.S. ambassador to Austria from 2009 to 2013. \"It's certainly going to give other nations pause when it comes to sharing intelligence with the Austrians.\"\n\nBoth Eacho and Beer say there is no concrete evidence that the FP\u00d6 has so far used its position in government to help Russia.\n\nBut the point, they say, is that Russian links alone would be enough to prompt concern among Western powers.\n\n\"In the Austrian Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior, which are controlled by the FP\u00d6, you have people collaborating with the power you are preparing yourself to go to war against. That's not very reassuring,\" says Gressel, the former defense official.\n\nOthers allege that the FP\u00d6's fondness for Russia has already had a measurable effect. Austria was one of the few European Union countries that refused to follow the U.K. and others in expelling Russian diplomats after the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter on British soil in March.\n\nThe FP\u00d6's senior coalition partner is the conservative People's Party (\u00d6VP), led by Prime Minister Sebastian Kurz. Kurz, 31, explained that he wouldn't expel diplomats because he wanted Austria to be a \"builder of bridges between East and West\" and \"to keep the channels of communication to Russia open.\"\n\nThe FP\u00d6 has also called for an end to anti-Russia sanctions and backed a referendum on leaving the European Union \u2014 an institution Putin has long sought to destabilize.\n\nIn February, the country's domestic intelligence service was raided, a move the FP\u00d6-controlled Interior Ministry said was to investigate alleged misuse of data by officials.\n\nBut Austria\u2019s president and others demanded an explanation after it emerged the police team that carried out the operation was a street crime unit not used to dealing with such cases, and was headed by an FP\u00d6 member.\n\nThe scandal dominated the Austria's news cycle for weeks, and according to media reports some of the material seized related to \"extremist\" far-right groups with FP\u00d6 links.\n\n\"The whole thing is outrageous,\" the leader of the liberal NEOS party, Matthias Strolz, told state broadcaster ORF. \"It stinks to high heaven.\"\n\nA rebalancing act\n\nAustria's warmth for Russia is neither new nor confined to the far-right, however.\n\nThe Allies and Soviets withdrew from the country in 1955 on the condition it wouldn't take sides in the Cold War. It entered the E.U. in 1995, but never joined NATO.\n\nMany Austrian citizens appear to have a fondness for Russia, too. More than one-third said they favored softer sanctions after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to a poll by the Austrian market research company OGM.\n\nBack in the kaffeehaus, Markovics and his friends say that \"heavy\" Western \"propaganda\" over Crimea spurred them into creating their activist group, called the Suworow Institute after a Russian military leader from the 1700s.\n\nThe institute employs seven people and has around 100 members, according to its founder, 31-year-old Patrick Poppel.\n\n\"We try to present a different perspective especially on Russian foreign policy,\" Poppel says, peering through his small, wire-rimmed glasses.\n\nPatrick Poppel is a former member of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) who founded a pro-Russia group, the Suworow Institute. Christian Wind / for NBC News\n\nPoppel and Markovics were both members of the FP\u00d6, but quit because they feel the party hadn't gone far enough in supporting Moscow while in government. They also say the FP\u00d6 has been too soft on what they call the \"Islamization\" of Europe by refugees.\n\nThey deny any links to the Russian state, and say they are not racist or fascist.\n\nHowever, Poppel talks of defending \"Christian civilization\" by closing Austria's borders to immigrants and Muslims. He also wants to repatriate all those deemed non-indigenous \u2014 even though his wife is from Armenia \u2014 and speaks out against liberals who advocate \"extreme homosexuality and feminism.\"\n\nUltimately, Markovics says, the group believes that \"elites\" in the U.S. and its allies are dominating Europe, and \"making profit out of actions that could lead us directly into nuclear apocalypse.\"\n\nThey see greater ties with Russia as a way to rebalance that.\n\n'Definitely not a threat'\n\nThe FP\u00d6 insists its links to Moscow are not problematic.\n\nJohannes H\u00fcbner is a lawyer, former FP\u00d6 lawmaker and member of the Austrian-Russian Friendship Society. He withdrew his candidacy in last year's legislative elections after giving a speech some claimed had anti-Semitic overtones \u2014 something he denies.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News over eggs and avocado on the veranda of his spacious Vienna apartment, H\u00fcbner recounted his time in Parliament.\n\n\"As a politician, I used a lot of my energy to lobby for more understanding for Russia and to lobby against cutting ties with Russia again,\" he says.\n\nUnlike the fringe Suworow Institute, the Austrian-Russian Friendship Society boasts high-profile politicians, businessmen and academics in Vienna and Moscow among its members.\n\nIts board includes prominent FP\u00d6 lawmaker Johann Gudenus, 41, a square-jawed speaker who studied in Moscow. He is often cited as the prime example of his party's deep ties with Russia. When contacted by NBC News, Gudenus' spokesman said he was not available.\n\nDoes H\u00fcbner see any problem or malice in fostering ties to a country often criticized by Western watchdogs as undemocratic and a human rights abuser?\n\n\"It is definitely not a threat,\" he says, smiling gently. \"I was in politics for almost nine years here and I would have realized if [Russia] tried to influence policy ... or if they bribed people for a dark network. It doesn't exist.\"\n\nLike many in the FP\u00d6, he says building bridges to Russia is important to counterbalance the \"overwhelming American influence,\" which is too often presented as the \"white knight\" of global affairs.\n\n\"The Moscow influence in Europe is zero,\" H\u00fcbner adds. \"It would be good if we had more influence from Russia.

Some 11 years after the country hosted the games at an estimated cost of $11 billion, many of the venues had been abandoned.

This has long been one of the main sticking points between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nOne of the driving forces behind the old legislative building laughed off the idea that Abu Dis could be a Palestinian capital, and the unfinished parliament its seat of government.\n\n\u201cDo you have money to buy it?\u201d joked Ahmed Qurei, the chief Palestinian negotiator of the Oslo Accords and an Abu Dis native.\n\nAhmed Qurei, also known as Abu Ala, was the senior Palestinian negotiator in the Oslo peace process in the 1990s.

A deal to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians is widely expected to pave the way for normalizing relations with much of the Arab world.\n\nIn January, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas essentially confirmed reports that he was being leaned on to accept Abu Dis as a capital.\n\nBut none of the 15 or so people NBC News spoke to in this dusty town of 13,000 welcomed the idea. On the contrary, growing disillusionment has led to despair and a hardening of attitudes among people who had sought reconciliation with Israel for 25 years.\n\nThe nail in the coffin of any potential peace deal, according to many Palestinians, was Trump\u2019s decision in December to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem and officially recognize the city as the capital of Israel.\n\nThis move convinced Fahad Abu El-Haj, 58, the director of the Abu Jihad Museum for the Prisoners Movement Affairs at Al-Quds University, to give up on negotiating with the Israelis altogether.\n\n\u201cArafat made us believe in Oslo,\u201d he said, referring to the peace process whereby the Palestinian Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat renounced the use of terrorism and other acts of violence, and recognized \u201cthe right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security.\u201d\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton invested considerable time and effort in trying to craft a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The failure of these efforts and the outbreak of what is known as the second Palestinian intifada in 2000 made Israelis who had supported the Oslo process wonder whether they could trust their Palestinian counterparts.\n\n\u201cAfter 25 years we have found we have nothing. The Americans, we find, are supporting only the Israelis,\u201d El-Haj said.\n\n\u201cSo I cannot accept negotiations anymore.

Why should I accept it?\u201d\n\nAnd what if it is imposed on the Palestinians by the Israeli, American and Arab leaders, as has been suggested?\n\n\u201cThe only plan I would accept is a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital,\u201d she said.\n\nAnwar Bader\u2019s 80-year-old aunt, Hamamh El Jafal, whose olive grove lies outside the walls of the town, is certain of whom the land belongs to.\n\n\u201cThis land was my grandfather\u2019s and then my father\u2019s,\u201d she said, describing how she tended the grove and made olive oil.\n\nHer father, Ahmed Salem Jafal, recognized her talent for working the land when she was young, and said he wished she had been born a boy \u2014 something El Jafal took as a great compliment.\n\nEl Jafal described what happened when she learned that the barrier was being built in 2003.\n\nHamamh El Jafal, 80, holds a photograph of her father, Ahmed Salem Jafal, who she says encouraged her love of farming.

I disagreed with some parts but I wanted peace,\u201d said Hikmat Suleiman, who sells refrigerators, washing machines and other appliances from a shop some 20 yards from the separation barrier. \u201cBut now there is no hope for peace.\u201d\n\nHikmat Suleiman, 50, who owns a home appliances store in Abu Dis, the Israel-occupied West Bank, says he once believed in peace with Israel but no longer.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nMarch 6, 2018, 10:42 AM GMT / Updated March 6, 2018, 10:49 AM GMT By Alexander Smith and Vladimir Banic\n\nSTOCKHOLM \u2014 Burrowed beneath a small park in Stockholm is a forgotten relic of the past that may help in the future.\n\nThe only clue to its existence is a green metal door, 8 feet high by 5 feet wide, hewn into the rock next to a busy, snow-dusted sidewalk.\n\nHeaving it open reveals an airlock that leads to a fully operational nuclear bunker.\n\nFacilities like this are a vital part of Sweden's history \u2014 and recent threats from Russia mean they could become important again in the years to come.\n\n\"They are meant to be used if the government decides to announce full alert,\" says Ove Brunnstr\u00f6m, the cheerful spokesman for Sweden's Civil Contingencies Agency who recently gave NBC News a rare tour of the subterranean site. \"That would be [triggered] if we are close to war or we are under attack.\"\n\nFew countries do bunkers like Sweden, which never joined NATO and could be considered one of the world's most peaceful nations over the past 200 years.\n\nIt honeycombed itself with civil defense shelters during the Cold War and today around 65,000 remain on standby, dotted around its sparsely populated territory.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Sweden slashed defense spending and halted bunker construction. Many were all but forgotten, doubling as parking lots and bicycle storage spaces during a period when global conflict seemed a distant prospect.\n\nThat thinking changed in 2014 when Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea, allegedly sent troops into eastern Ukraine, and began violating airspace over the Nordic and Baltic regions.\n\n\"Ukraine was a wake-up call for the Swedes, and it really renewed the national discussion surrounding defense,\" says Erik Brattberg, a fellow at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank.\n\nLocal officials Thomas Schil\u00e9n and Dan Backman inside the nuclear bunker in the Torsgatan area of Stockholm. Mikael Sjoeberg / for NBC News\n\nThis perceived threat has prompted Sweden to order a reboot of its once-proud policy of \"total defense\" \u2014 which calls on the military and civilians to act together to ward off attackers. Bunkers are an integral part of this hunker-down strategy.\n\nIn December, the country's Defense Commission recommended modernizing existing shelters while planning the construction of the first new ones in more than 15 years.\n\n\"It's expensive to build shelters, the Cold War was over and we had quite a calm situation in Europe,\" says Brunnstr\u00f6m, explaining his country's change of heart. \"But what happened in Ukraine in 2014, I think, shocked the Western world.\"\n\nSimulated military strike\n\nToday's threat is different from the one posed by the Soviet-U.S. standoff. Hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and propaganda now have far greater prominence.\n\nBut many Western analysts say Sweden should not be complacent about the risk of a traditional military conflict.\n\nIn April 2013, six Russian aircraft carried out a nighttime mission in which they simulated a nuclear strike on Stockholm. The next year, Sweden launched a large search operation for what was believed to be a Russian submarine that had infiltrated waters near the capital.\n\nLast week, Putin boasted that Russia has a new array of nuclear-capable weapons including an intercontinental ballistic missile that renders defense systems \u201cuseless.\u201d He said that Russia had \"no plans to be an aggressor\" but also accused the West of \"ignoring us,\" adding: \"Listen to us now.\"\n\nAnd even a minor incident could have serious consequences for the delicate geopolitical balance between Russia and the U.S.\n\nOne nightmare scenario for the West involves Russia invading the Swedish island of Gotland, blocking off NATO supply routes to its vulnerable Baltic allies. Last year, Sweden re-militarized the island but experts say the force is too small to provide any real resistance.\n\n\"No one thought four years ago that Russia would annex Crimea and invade eastern Ukraine,\" said Heather A. Conley, a former State Department official under President George W. Bush who is now director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"This means we have to imagine what we would have previously considered unimaginable.\"\n\nAn empty clothes hanger inside a public bomb and fallout shelter in central Stockholm. Mikael Sjoeberg / for NBC News\n\nSweden has developed close ties with NATO in recent years. Its military personnel have served and died during U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan and Kosovo. And several polls last year showed that for the first time more Swedes supported joining the alliance than opposed it.\n\nBut full NATO membership still seems a long way off. Before any referendum is held, there would need to be cross-party consensus, and the move is still opposed by the ruling Social Democratic-Green coalition.\n\nSwedes are also highly suspicious of President Donald Trump, with just 10 percent saying they had confidence in him to do the right thing on global affairs, according to a study by the Pew Research Center last June. Of the countries surveyed, only Mexico, Jordan and Spain had a lower opinion of the president.\n\nBecause Sweden is a non-NATO member, the U.S. and the rest of alliance would not be obliged to come to its defense if it were attacked.\n\nAs Fredrik Wesslau, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, put it: \"It is a classic case of speaking loudly and wielding a small stick.\"\n\nBack in the bunker, Brunnstr\u00f6m says scary-sounding news stories have a tangible effect.\n\nOve Brunnstr\u00f6m speaks inside the Stockholm shelter. Mikael Sjoeberg / for NBC News\n\nIf something happens in the news, in North Korea or somewhere else, \"we notice there is a lot more telephone calls coming in about shelters,\" Brunnstr\u00f6m says. \"People asking about shelters, 'Where to find my shelter?' And questions like that.\"\n\nSomeone else who sees this phenomenon is Tord Str\u00f8mdal, 42, an administrator for Sweden's largest Facebook group for doomsday preppers.\n\nStr\u00f8mdal says his online survivalist community of 25,000 members ranges from doctors and teachers to police officers and soldiers.\n\nTord Str\u00f8mdal Vladimir Banic / NBC News\n\nBut Str\u00f8mdal, a 6-foot-4 Viking of a man with a plaited beard, doesn't think Putin will invade Sweden. He believes his country is far more vulnerable to subtler things such as cyberattacks aimed at disabling utilities and other important infrastructure.\n\nTo him, being a prepper is just part of the self-reliance that appears culturally hardwired into many Swedes.\n\n\"It's very common to make that kind of assumption that I'm some kind of crazy tinfoil-hat lunatic, and those certainly do exist within the prepper community,\" he says. \"But most people in our group, they're just normal, ordinary people who come to the conclusion that they need to have a certain level of preparation.\"\n\nBut the event that saw the biggest boost in the group's membership wasn't related to Russia or North Korea.\n\n\"There was a huge bump after Trump got elected,\" he says. \"I don't think that most Swedes see him as a stable world leader. I think most Swedes see Trump as a someone who is decreasing global security.\"\n\n'Unacceptable costs on any invader'\n\nThe origins of Sweden's bunkers can be traced back two centuries.\n\nIn 1814, it became the first country to declare neutrality in all global conflicts. Until recently that was also the last time it officially fought in a war, meaning it enjoyed almost 200 years of uninterrupted peace.\n\nThis did not mean giving up its arms, however.\n\nFinding itself between the nuclear-armed U.S. and the Soviet Union, Sweden amassed one of the Cold War's most powerful coastal defenses and a formidable, high-tech military featuring some 1,000 aircraft.\n\nThe \"total defense\" policy also included hundreds of thousands of reservists and civilian home guard personnel \u2014 not to mention its extensive network of bunkers where the rest of the population could weather any attack.\n\nCivilian self-reliance became baked into the Swedish psyche.\n\nThis was crucial to Swedes' feeling safe. Although its military was strong, in the face of a global superpower it \"could not realistically defeat a determined invasion by directly facing the adversary at the borders,\" says Dylan Lee Lehrke, a senior military analyst at IHS Markit, a data analysis firm in London.\n\n\"In order to achieve this deterrence,\" he says, the military and civilian force \"needs to be able to impose unacceptable costs on any invader.\"\n\nLocal official Dan Backman opens the gates to a fallout shelter in Stockholm. Mikael Sjoeberg / for NBC News\n\nThe bunker NBC News visited in Stockholm is far more striking than most of Sweden's shelters, which are mostly mundane basements below houses and apartment blocks.\n\nSome 200 feet long and 20 feet wide, the half-cylindrical hideout was built in the 1940s and has remained largely untouched since it was renovated in the 1970s.\n\nIt could easily double as a walk-in museum or even the secret lair of a James Bond villain. Painted in patriotic Swedish blue and yellow, it is festooned with large ventilation pipes that can keep out gamma radiation and other potential hazards.\n\nThe space seems cavernous, but it would be teeming if crammed to capacity with 180 bodies for the maximum recommended time of three days.\n\nEach person would have an allocated space of 2.5 square feet \u2014 just blankets on the floor, no room for beds. The bathroom facilities are a bucket behind a thin wooden door.\n\n\"As in all places where you put lots of people together in a small space, there will probably be some kind of problems in here,\" Brunnstr\u00f6m says. \"But I think it has very much to do with what's happening on the outside. I think if there's an air raid going on, for example, they would be very happy to stay in here.\"\n\nIn September, the Civil Contingencies Agency concluded there was room in its shelters to protect 7 million people \u2014 in a country of 10 million.\n\nThe bunker dates to the 1940s. Mikael Sjoeberg / for NBC News\n\nUnlike Switzerland \u2014 perhaps the only nation with a more extensive network \u2014 Sweden has never tried to accommodate all of its population in shelters. Still, news of the shortfall was dramatic.\n\nThe agency pressed the need to investigate potential sites for new bunkers.\n\nIn December, the Defense Commission also recommended modernizing existing shelters while building enough new ones to accommodate an extra 2,500 people every year.\n\nIts bunker plan would not start until 2021 and would cost $40 million per year. Separately, the Civil Contingencies said 500 new bunkers housing 50,000 people would cost up to 2 billion Swedish kronor, around $125 million, and take 10 years to complete.\n\nAfter its post-Cold War timeout, total defense is once again the official policy of Sweden. As well as refocusing on bunkers, this liberal, progressive nation has also reintroduced a partial military draft.\n\n\"When the Cold War ended, Sweden no longer perceived an imminent threat to the homeland,\" says Stephen J. Flanagan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a think tank headquartered in Santa Monica, California.\n\n\"With the re-emergence of a threat from the East,\" he said, \"Sweden is in the process of restoring capabilities for defense of the homeland.\""}]
