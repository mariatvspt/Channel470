Hannah Gaber Saletan, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Occasionally, his signature appears on court documents.

William Barr, the man likely to be confirmed as his next boss, cast doubt on whether he would permit that document to be revealed. Those who know him say Mueller, reluctant to speak publicly even when the circumstances seem to require it, is unlikely to do it on his own.\n\n\"A public narrative has built an expectation that the special counsel will explain his conclusions, but I think that expectation may be seriously misplaced,\" said John Pistole, Mueller's longtime top deputy at the FBI. \"That's not what the rules provide, and I really don't see him straying from the mission. That's not who he is.\"\n\nThe Justice Department's special counsel rules don't call for Mueller to make any public statements about his work, let alone deliver a report of what he has found. Instead, his confidential report must explain why he filed the charges he did and why he might have declined to bring charges against others. It would be up to the attorney general to decide whether that becomes public.\n\nBarr, who is likely to be confirmed this month as attorney general, told lawmakers he couldn't commit to releasing Mueller's report in full. Neither was he clear on whether he would permit Mueller to testify to Congress about his work. He said he wanted to be transparent about Mueller's findings but offered few details.\n\n\"Where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and department policy and will let no personal, political or other improper interests influence my decision,\" Barr said during his confirmation hearing in January.\n\nSome lawmakers found the answer unsettling.\n\nAfter Barr's testimony, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., introduced legislation that would require a special counsel to provide a report directly to Congress in addition to the attorney general.\n\nPeople who know Mueller say that unless his bosses tried to derail his work, they would be surprised if the former FBI director did more than issue a brief statement indicating that a report had been submitted to the attorney general before quietly departing.\n\nFor any other major player in official Washington, where outsize egos routinely clash for political supremacy or simple adulation, such a scenario would be unthinkable. But Mueller's aversion to the spotlight has been consistent across a lifetime in public service, from the battlefields of Vietnam to the office that represents perhaps the most serious threat to the Trump presidency.\n\n\"I don't think that there is any chance that he strays from what the regulations say,\" said Chris Swecker, a former FBI assistant director who worked closely with Mueller. \"So far, he has spoken through the indictments and other court documents his office has filed. You have to understand who he is. He will do what the law prescribes; he's not going to be running his own pass patterns.\n\n\u201cNone of this has ever been about his ego,\u201d Swecker said. \u201cHe relishes the work as much as he hates the fanfare. It\u2019s never been about him; it\u2019s always been about the work.\u201d\n\nMeticulous investigator\n\nJust as the FBI, maligned in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, was transformed into his own image as a meticulous investigator, the Russia investigation has come to embody Mueller\u2019s unflagging, buttoned-up personality.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a warm and lovable guy,\u201d Swecker said. \u201cIf you work for him, you are never going to feel appreciated. Things move too fast for that. He believes that you signed up to do a job. And it\u2019s your mission to get it done. He doesn\u2019t like drama.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s team embraced that approach.\n\nHis prosecutors have brought charges against 34 people and three companies, including Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort; his first national security adviser, Mike Flynn; and his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Outside of court filings, prosecutors have had nothing to say about any of them.\n\nWhen the team won a jury verdict after a three-week trial against Manafort, prosecutors retreated to their offices rather than appear at a clutch of microphones outside the courthouse. Asked by email if they had any comment, Mueller's spokesman responded with a single word:\n\n\u201cNope.\"\n\nPistole, who served for six years as Mueller\u2019s deputy at the FBI, describes his former boss as \u201ctotally apolitical,\u201d with an unmatched work ethic.\n\n\u201cFor him, it was about what is right for the country,\u201d Pistole said. \u201cNothing else.\u201d\n\n'Most transformative director since Hoover'\n\nMueller exited the FBI in 2013 as the longest-serving director since J. Edgar Hoover \u2013 amassing a legacy best defined by a grind-it-out style that kept the FBI intact.\n\nMichael Chertoff, a former secretary of Homeland Security, described Mueller in an interview with USA TODAY marking the FBI chief's departure as \u201cthe most transformative director in the history of the FBI since Hoover.''\n\n\"And I mean that in a good way,\" Chertoff said.\n\nCLOSE Robert Mueller will oversee the Russia investigation. Here's a look at his background. USA TODAY\n\nAfter the FBI, Mueller stayed on the public stage but seldom in the spotlight.\n\nAs a partner at the high-powered law firm of Wilmer Hale, Mueller had clients that included some of the most recognizable corporate brands, including the National Football League.\n\nThe NFL hired Mueller in 2015 to examine the league's handling of a domestic violence incident involving then-Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice. When it was complete, the 96-page report, which cleared the NFL of any intentional improper conduct, was simply posted online. No news conference, no public appearance by Mueller to discuss the findings.\n\nMueller was among those Trump interviewed to replace his ousted successor at the FBI, James Comey. Instead, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 to head the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nSince then, the public has had only occasional glimpses of Mueller. One photo captured him waiting for a plane at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, a few yards away from Donald Trump Jr. The photograph went viral, a measure not only of the chance passing of the two potential adversaries but the intense interest in the intensely private man leading perhaps the most widely watched criminal investigation in a generation.\n\nIt was months before Mueller's appointment as a Russia special counsel when Pistole last had an extended visit with his former boss. Pistole said he was surprised to encounter a \"jovial\" Mueller, a feature few have witnessed in such an outwardly serious character.\n\n\"He had been away from government for a while,\" Pistole said. \"He was laughing and joking. I thought: \u2018Who is this guy? What have you done with my director?\u2019 I doubt he's had many moments since he took this job.\"\n\nThe case for saying nothing\n\nBarr suggested that if the Senate confirms him, the public is unlikely to hear from Mueller directly.\n\nBarr, who was attorney general in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has made no secret of his allegiance to the chain of command. In the midst of the 2016 campaign, he objected to then-FBI Director Comey's decision not to recommend criminal charges against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state because he said the decision should have been left to the attorney general or the deputy attorney general, not the chief investigator.\n\nBarr told lawmakers he would \"provide as much transparency as I can, consistent with the law,\" about what Mueller's investigation concludes.\n\nHe expressed doubt about how much detail he would be able to reveal. Justice Department rules require only that he notify Congress about instances in which he had overruled Mueller's decisions about how the investigation should be handled. Some of the facts Mueller has gathered could be the result of grand jury proceedings, which are required by law to remain secret.\n\nBarr pointed to a Justice Department policy to avoid publicizing \"derogatory\" information about people who aren't charged with a crime. Senate Democrats expressed concern that the policy, combined with the department's view that a president cannot be indicted, could lead Barr to keep confidential parts of the investigation that relate to Trump.\n\nThat could in turn set up a battle with congressional Democrats eager to know the details.\n\n\u201cIf the attorney general doesn\u2019t issue a public report, they can expect it to be subpoenaed by Congress because of the high public value of Americans understanding just what the Russians did and who worked with them,\u201d said Rep.

Just the FAQs\n\nA federal judge appeared poised on Thursday to order the government to fully account for all migrant families that were separated before and after the Trump administration formally announced it's \"zero-tolerance\" policy.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ordered the administration to end the family separation policy on June 26, 2018, and to reunite nearly 3,000 children who were being held in the Department of Health and Human Services at the time of his order.\n\nBut the ACLU is now asking the judge to expand his order to include families that were separated during the previous year, following media reports and an inspector general report that revealed the administration had an unofficial family separation policy in place as far back as July 2017.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Scott Stewart fought back against the ACLU request during a court hearing before Sabraw on Thursday, arguing that the government has gone \"above and beyond\" to facilitate the reunification of thousands of children with their parents rather than fight the judge's order \"tooth and nail.\"\n\nRequiring the government to identify potentially thousands of children that were separated in the previous year, Stewart said, would \"blow the case into some other galaxy\" and could force Justice to take a different approach to the lawsuit.\n\n\"I'm just not sure that we can keep going that way,\" Stewart said.\n\nSabraw explained that the ultimate goal of the lawsuit is to \"bring to light\" the wrongs committed by the administration's family separation policy, even if that requires government agencies taking on the difficult task of poring through records to identify all children that were separated.\n\nHe said his original order only required the reunification of children in government custody at that time because the size and scope of the family separation policy was unknown at that time.\n\nA mother migrating from Honduras holds her 1-year-old child while surrendering to U.S. Border Patrol agents after illegally crossing the border near McAllen, Texas, on June 25, 2018.

Phillip, AP)\n\n\"No one but a few in the government knew that these separations had been going on nine or 10 months before, and that hundreds if not thousands of children were,\" being separated, Sabraw said. \"The court didn\u2019t know that and plaintiffs didn\u2019t know that, and I don\u2019t think government counsel knew that.\"\n\nSabraw did not rule from the bench, but already started discussing what the next steps could look like.\n\nACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said he was prepared to organize a steering committee of volunteers and pro bono attorneys to help track down all separated parents and children, just as they've been doing to find the more than 2,800 families that have been at the core of the lawsuit. But he said officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which carried out the separations, and the Department of Health and Human Services, which cared for the separated children, need to be involved since they're the ones who hold all the information on each family's case.\n\n\"We are prepared no matter how big the burden is,\" Gelernt said.\n\nSabraw asked whether the government could tap Cmdr. Jonathan White, an HHS official, to lead DHS and HHS in their reunification efforts. White oversaw the government efforts to reunite the original group of 2,800 children, and has drawn praise from the judge, the ACLU and even members of Congress for his work.\n\nAnd while Sabraw said he was not sure how the additional reunifications would eventually be carried out, he said the first step had to be simply getting a full list of every family that was separated.\n\n\"It's important to recognize that we're talking about human beings,\" Sabraw said. \"Every person needs to be accounted for.\"\n\nFAMILIES ON THE BORDER: Despite ban, Trump administration continues separating migrant families at the border in some cases\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/judge-sabraw-may-order-trump-reunite-thousands-more-separated-families-homeland-security/2943870002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/02/21/jussie-smollett-charged-felony-staged-attack-to-promote-career-police-say/2936589002/", "text": "CLOSE Jussie Smollett went from assault victim to suspect within weeks. Here are the events that led up to the \"Empire\" actor turning himself in. USA TODAY\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett plotted an attack to make himself look like the victim of a brutal anti-black, homophobic crime, prosecutors said Thursday.\n\nHe scouted out the exact location with the two brothers he paid to stage the hoax, offered specific instructions on how he wanted to be beaten, and even gave them $100 to buy supplies used in the staged assault, prosecutors said.\n\nThe revelations came as Smollett made his first court appearance Thursday afternoon at a bond hearing following his early-morning arrest on a charge of disorderly conduct by filing a false police report.\n\nJudge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. set Smollett\u2019s bond at $100,000 and ordered him to surrender his passport. No plea was entered and the actor said little other than giving his name. Smollett posted bond late Thursday afternoon and walked out of the Cook County Jail without making comment to a phalanx of reporters.\n\nActor/singer Jussie Smollett (Photo: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nSmollett, who is gay and black, told investigators he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck in the fashion of a noose and poured bleach on him. He also told investigators that the men who attacked yelled, \"This is MAGA country,\" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan.\n\nAssistant State\u2019s Attorney Risa Lanier said Smollett plotted the attack with the brothers, describing one of the men, Abimbola \u201cAbel\u201d Osundairo, 25, as a close friend of the actor's.\n\nLanier gave the prosecution's outline of the incident:\n\nThree men met on Jan. 25 and planned the attack during a conversation in the actor\u2019s car. The attack was originally planned for 10 p.m. CST on Jan. 28, but had to be pushed back a few hours because the actor\u2019s flight from New York was delayed.\n\nSmollett asked the other brother, Olabinjo Osundairo, to \"place a rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him and yell, \u2018This is MAGA country.' \u201d\n\nHe also initially directed the brothers to pour gasoline on him during the attack but later suggested they use bleach, Lanier said.\n\n'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett emerges from the Cook County Court complex in Chicago after posting 10 percent of a $100,000 bond.

The actor picked the men up from their home on the city\u2019s North Side and drove them to the area near his apartment where he wanted them to stage the attack. A witness, an employee of nearby NBC News, saw it all go down.\n\nThe actor instructed the brothers not to bring their cellphones with them. That day he also wrote a $3,500 check to Abel Osundairo that was backdated to Jan. 23.\n\nHe also gave them $100 to buy a ski mask, red hat and other supplies to be used in the attack, Lanier said.\n\n\u201cSmollett also stated that he wanted the brothers to catch his attention by calling him an \u2018Empire' F, 'Empire' N,\u201d Lanier said. \u201cSmollett further detailed he wanted Abel to attack him, but not hurt him too badly and give him a chance to appear to fight back.\"\n\nProsecutors say texts between Abel Osundairo and Smollett show he also provided the drug ecstasy to the actor.\n\nA half dozen people who were identified to the court as family members of Smollett watched the roughly 15 minute hearing.\n\nSmollett, wearing a light black winter coat, watched intently as Lanier detailed the prosecution\u2019s case. At moments, his mouth fell slightly agape as Lanier outlined what they think happened.\n\nJudge Lyke was taken aback by the allegations outlined against Smollett even as he told the actor he has the presumption of innocence.\n\n\u201cThe most vile and despicable part of it, if it\u2019s true, is the noose,\" said Lyke, who is black. \"That symbol conjures up such evil in this country\u2019s history.\"\n\nJack Prior, a member Smollett\u2019s legal defense team, said his client \u201cvehemently denies\u201d the charges and said that the case presented by prosecutors doesn\u2019t jibe with the actor\u2019s character.\n\nHe noted that in his five years living in Chicago, Smollett has become involved in philanthropy and volunteer work, even giving song-writing classes to detainees in the Illinois correctional system.\n\nSmollett's defense team \u2013 which recently added Los Angeles-based celebrity defense lawyer Mark Geragos to assist with the case \u2013 later said in a statement: \u201cToday we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.\u201d\n\nAt a morning news conference, police detailed how the 36-year-old actor choreographed the attack in an attempt to raise his profile.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is also African-American, said Smollett staged the Jan. 29 attack to look like a hate crime, to take \"advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career ... because he was dissatisfied with his salary.\"\n\nSmollett has played Jamal Lyon on \"Empire\" since 2015. Fox said Thursday it is weighing its response.\n\n\u201cWe understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process,\" 20th Century Fox Studio and Fox Entertainment said in a statement. \"We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.\u201d\n\n\u201c\n\nActor Jussie Smollett is seen in his booking photo, taken Feb. 21, 2019, following his arrest on charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.

They were seen running from the area, Commander Edward Wodnicki said.\n\n.\n\nPolice learned that the Osundairos, both U.S. citizens, had flown to Nigeria soon after the attack, so officers immediately arrested the men at O'Hare International Airport.\n\nThe brothers were held in police custody for nearly two full days, the maximum police can hold suspects without charging them, before they cooperated with investigators. Their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, told police the brothers were willing to give a video interview.\n\n\u201cIt was at that time that this investigation began to spin in an absolutely new direction,\u201d Wodnicki said.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI is also in preliminary stages of investigating Smollet's role in the threatening letter sent to him at the Chicago studio where \"Empire\" films.\n\nThe letter was sent on Jan. 22, one week before his alleged assault. He could potentially faced federal charges as well, investigators said.\n\nJohnson called on Smollett to come clean. Police did not immediately have an estimate for how much was spent carrying out the investigation.\n\n\u201cAbsolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared, admitting what he did and then be man enough to offer what he should offer up in terms of all the resources that were put into this,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, Carly Mallenbaum\n\nMore: Don Lemon weighs in on Jussie Smollett: 'There were credible reasons to be skeptical'\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/02/21/jussie-smollett-charged-felony-staged-attack-to-promote-career-police-say/2936589002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/steve-king-plans-reelection-bid/2944111002/", "text": "CLOSE Iowa Rep. Steve King is seeking re-election in 2020 despite controversy over his history of racist comments. King joined \"Iowa Press\" to discuss his comments. USA TODAY\n\nA defiant Rep. Steve King confirmed Thursday that he will run for a 10th term as an Iowa congressman, despite controversies over his history of caustic remarks, including about race and immigration.\n\nThe Kiron Republican has been criticized by national and state leaders of his own party, has been stripped of committee assignments in Congress and has drawn three primary challengers for the 2020 race.\n\nIn a Thursday taping of Iowa Public Television\u2019s \u201cIowa Press\u201d program, host David Yepsen asked him: \u201cAre you sorry for anything that you\u2019ve said?\u201d\n\nThe congressman replied: \u201cI have nothing to apologize for, Dave.\u201d\n\nKing confirmed that he will run for re-election in 2020, despite drawing three challengers for the Republican nomination. He offered a message to voters in his northwest Iowa district: \u201cDon\u2019t let the elitists in this country, the power brokers in this country, tell you who\u2019s going to represent you in the United States Congress.\u201d\n\nThe \"Iowa Press\" show is scheduled to air on IPTV at 7:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nCriticism of King ramped up in January, after the New York Times quoted him as saying: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa were among the leading Republicans who criticized the remark. U.S. House Republicans stripped him of his committee posts and the U.S. House members, including King, condemned white nationalism and supremacy.\n\nOn the IPTV show Thursday, King portrayed the New York Times passage as a \u201cmisquote.\u201d As he has before, he said he was talking about Western civilization, not white supremacy. King blamed his troubles on media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which he accused of twisting his words and \u201cweaponizing\u201d the language.\n\n\u201cIf you would just hold these publications to what is true, there is no story whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s no part of me that believes in anything that\u2019s advocated by folks that identify themselves as white nationalists or white supremacy.\u201d\n\nYepsen, a former Des Moines Register columnist, challenged King on his claim the quote attributed to him by New York Times political reporter Trip Gabriel was wrong. \u201cHe\u2019s known as a pretty good reporter,\u201d Yepsen told King. \u201c\u2026 That\u2019s one of the reasons why this has had such momentum on it.\u201d\n\nKing replied: \u201cHe can say he\u2019s a respected reporter \u2014 and I think he\u2019s a personable fella; that\u2019s probably part of the reason why we had a 56-minute conversation.\u201d But he said Gabriel never produced a recording or transcript of the interview.\n\n\u201cIowa Press\u201d panelist Erin Murphy, a political reporter for Lee Enterprises, asked King about the effects of being stripped of his committee assignments in Congress after the New York Times story was published. \u201cIs there any way for you to be an effective congressman for the 4th District?\u201d Murphy asked.\n\nKing said he doesn\u2019t think being on a committee matters as much for a Republican now that Democrats are running the House.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s ever going to be a time not to have committee assignments, this time with Nancy Pelosi as the speaker of the House is the time,\u201d he said.\n\n\"Iowa Press\" panelist Kay Henderson, news director of Radio Iowa, asked King about a small Confederate flag that was spotted on his desk in 2016. Critics say the flag\u2019s presence demonstrated his racism.\n\nKing told Henderson he put it there briefly as a sign of his support for free speech amid controversies over whether the Confederate flag could be flown.\n\n\u201cIt stayed there for a few weeks. I took it down. It\u2019s not been there since,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his ancestors included abolitionists and a soldier who died fighting against slavery.\n\n\u201cI understand all of this,\" King said. \"Abraham Lincoln \u2014 his life was all about saving the Union.

Local court officials mistakenly released secret court documents identifying Henderson's occupation and other important clues to a mother-and-son robbery team that he had informed on to police detectives, according to an Arapahoe County, Colorado criminal affidavit released Thursday.\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2016, Henderson, a car mechanic, was shot 10 times and killed in front of the Denver home where he lived with his mother. Prosecutors say the motive for the killing was Henderson's cooperation with detectives in describing details surrounding a marijuana shop robbery two months earlier.\n\n\u201cThis is the nightmare scenario,\" Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said. The court system has taken the necessary steps and closed a loophole to make sure criminals don't get such documents again, according to Brauchler.\n\nThe robbers who court documents say orchestrated the execution-style hit, Terance Black, 26, and his mother, Tina Black, 51, were both sentenced to life without parole Thursday.

Prosecutors said Terance Black found out about Henderson's cooperation with police while he was out on bond for the robbery charges.\n\nThe Denver Post reported that discovery documents, which provided evidence in the robbery case, were erroneously mailed to someone in the investigation. That person called Terance Black and told him 'the mechanic' was talking to police, the Post reported.\n\nTerance Black is quoted in the affidavit, saying that he \"got the (court papers) of the guy telling . . . about the robbery.\"\n\nTerance Black told a friend that he had read court papers that pointed to Henderson as a witness and that he \"had been running his mouth . . . Terance Black said he read half of it and Mr. Henderson's name was 'all over it, telling,'\" according to the criminal affidavit.\n\nTerance Black told the acquaintance that if Henderson didn't show up to testify, \"they didn't have a case,\" the affidavit says. \"They could not prosecute them because Mr. Henderson was 'the witness.'\" Black also said that \"we're gonna have to kill him.\"\n\nBoth Terance and Tina Black were overheard at one point saying that Henderson \"had been snitching and snitches get stitches,\" the affidavit said.\n\nThis undated booking photo provided by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office shows Tina Black.

The issue is collectively bargained between the NBA and NBPA, and both sides need to agree to any rule change.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver during 2019 All-Star Weekend. (Photo: Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe timing of the proposal is coincidental in relation to Duke star Zion Williamson\u2019s injury, but his injury re-ignited the debate about one-and-done college players who may otherwise enter the draft after high school rather than spending a season in college and bypassing millions of dollars.\n\nOPINION: Don't blame NCAA after Williamson's injury\n\nOPINION: Williamson should never play another minute with Duke\n\nNIKE: Takes heat after Zion Williamson's shoe failure\n\nAt the July NBA owners\u2019 meeting, Silver told reporters: \u201cMy personal view is that we\u2019re ready to make that change. \u2026 When I\u2019ve weighed the pros and cons, given that Condoleezza Rice and her Commission (On College Basketball) has recommended to the NBA that those one-and-done players now come directly into the league, and in essence the college community is saying we do not want those players anymore. That sort of tips the scale in my mind that we should be taking a serious look at lowering our age to 18.\u201d\n\nWhy the 2022 draft? The league wants to give teams ample time to prepare for the change, and with the NBA submitting a proposal to the union now, it's clear it would prefer to reach an agreement, or at least a framework of the deal, in the next few months.\n\nAs is the case in CBA negotiations, obstacles remain. ESPN reported in October that the NBA wanted agents to provide medical reports on players and mandate attendance and some participation in the draft combine. That would give teams more information to make better selections in the draft. There is some pushback from agents to divulge information, but teams may not be willing to draft a player out of high school without a physical.\n\nBut the union is not opposed to lowering the age limit, and in July, NBPA executive director Michele Roberts told reporters, \u201cStay tuned \u2026 I suspect that we'll have some news in the next few months.\"\n\nBoth sides seem willing to get a deal done, and there is confidence it will get done. Even though the CBA doesn't expire until the end of the 2023-24 season, both sides can agree to amend rules before then."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/02/21/haley-moss-may-first-autistic-lawyer-florida/2914135002/", "text": "CLOSE She was diagnosed with autism at age three.

Moss' diagnosis with autism, at age 3, came with warnings that she might not finish high school, get a driver's license or make a friend.\n\nThe Parkland native did all those things and more, earning two bachelor's degrees \u2014 in criminology and psychology \u2014 by age 20 before graduating from the University of Miami School of Law in May 2018.\n\nZumpano Patricios now calls Moss \"one of the first documented autistic attorneys to join the Florida Bar and a major law firm,\" though firm co-founder Joe Zumpano believes \"she may be one of the first nationally.\"\n\n\"I hired her the moment I met her,\" said Zumpano, who has a 16-year-old son with autism. In Moss, he saw \"a brilliant person with a brilliant mind.\"\n\nAt the firm, Moss specializes in anti-terrorism and healthcare, fields that entail massive swaths of information.

Ralph Northam's 1984 medical school yearbook page featuring a person wearing blackface and another in a KKK hood, reporters from the USA TODAY Network undertook a comprehensive review of more than 900 publications at 120 schools around the nation.\n\nThe review offers perspective on an array of cases that have emerged since the Northam reports and showed that throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a stunning number of colleges and university yearbooks published images of blatant racism on campus.\n\n\n\nAt Cornell University in New York, three fraternity members are listed in the 1980 yearbook as \u201cKu,\u201d \u201cKlux\u201d and \u201cKlan.\u201d For their 1971 yearbook picture, a dozen University of Virginia fraternity members, some armed, wore dark cloaks and hoods while peering up at a lynched mannequin in blackface. In one of the most striking images \u2013 from the 1981 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign yearbook \u2013 a black man is smiling and holding a beer while posing with three people in full KKK regalia.\n\nReporters collected more than 200 examples of offensive or racist material at colleges in 25 states, from large public universities in the South, Ivy League schools in the Northeast, liberal arts boutiques and Division I powerhouses.\n\nNo other politicians were identified by USA TODAY Network\u2019s review which focused on the same time period as Northam\u2019s yearbook in the era after sweeping civil rights reform. Few images had captions to provide names or context and people\u2019s faces were often hidden behind hoods or blackface.\n\nIn one yearbook, from Arizona State University, reporters discovered that USA TODAY Editor Nicole Carroll had designed a page that included a photo of two people, at a fraternity\u2019s Halloween party, in black makeup as actress Robin Givens and boxer Mike Tyson. Carroll, who was editor of the yearbook in 1989 when the photo ran, expressed regret after learning of the photo.\n\nExperts say that even if school officials don\u2019t have direct oversight over the yearbooks, responsibility rests with the entire institution: A campus culture that fostered racist behavior; yearbook staffs that chose to memorialize it; and administrations that failed to condemn the images when they were published for the world to see.\n\nFollow Natalie Allison on Twitter at @natalie_allison\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/21/bill-lee-tennessee-governor-auburn-yearbook-confederate-yearbook/2945368002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/north-carolina-voter-fraud-charges-dog-house-race-mark-harris/2938521002/", "text": "CLOSE A new election in a North Carolina congressional race was ordered after the Republican candidate conceded that his apparent victory was tainted by evidence by ballot-tampering by political operatives working for him.

The board did not immediately set a schedule.\n\nFollowing last November\u2019s election, Republican Mark Harris had held a slim lead over Democrat Dan McCready in unofficial results from the district running from Charlotte through several counties to the east.\n\nBut the state refused to certify the win because of charges of absentee-ballot irregularities.\n\nHarris said Thursday during the hearing that he thought a new election should be called \u2013 reversing months of urging state election officials to certify him as the winner.\n\n\u201cThrough the testimony I\u2019ve listened to over the past three days, I believe a new election should be called,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear to me that the public\u2019s confidence in the 9th District seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted.\u201d\n\nHarris and Democrat Dan McCready have been battling to represent the 9th Congressional District, three months after voters went to the polls Nov. 6.\n\nIn a case marked by twists and turns, Harris testified Thursday saying political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr. told him his team wouldn't handle absentee ballots, which is in violation of state law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget. He said it again and again. He said: We do not take the ballot,\u201d Harris testified.\n\nHarris\u2019 son, John Harris, an assistant U.S. attorney in North Carolina, testified Wednesday that he warned his father about some questionable practices of Dowless.\n\nHarris, who cried as his son testified, has said he didn\u2019t know of any ballot problems.\n\nThe race is the last of the 2018 midterms to be decided.

Some witnesses working for Dowless testified that, among other things, they forged signatures.\n\nDowless refused to testify.\n\nWhat are state election officials investigating?\n\nThe State Board of Elections delayed certifying election results last fall because it said it would launch an investigation into charges of voting irregularities.\n\nDowless, a political operative in the area, is accused of leading an effort that had workers encouraging voters to request an absentee ballot, then collecting those ballots and turning them in, which is illegal in North Carolina. The allegations led to charges of ballot tampering.\n\nPolitical operative Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr. stands outside his home in Bladenboro, North Carolina, on Dec. 5, 2018.

But it took a turn after charges of voter fraud surfaced.\n\nThe State Board of Elections didn\u2019t certify the election.\n\nThe North Carolina race was one of several that raised concerns about voter fraud and voter suppression by Democrats and civil rights groups. Georgia election officials had come under scrutiny after Democrats charged that they tried to suppress the rights of black voters.

What is this always-fatal condition and how do people fight its spread? Wochit-All\n\nAs people wonder what might happen if humans eat meat from \"zombie\" deer, there is at least one group of people who already know.\n\nOn March 13, 2005, a fire company in Oneida County, New York, fed the meat of a deer that tested positive for chronic wasting disease to 200 to 250 people. The company didn't know the meat was from a diseased deer. Laboratory tests for one of the deer served came back positive for CWD later.\n\nBecause little was known about what happens to people who eat infected meat, the Oneida County Health Department monitored the group's health through a surveillance project. About 80 people who ate the venison agreed to participate. Together with the State University of New York-Binghamton, health experts checked in with the group of mostly white males over the course of six years to see whether they developed any unusual symptoms.\n\nStart the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing delivered to your inbox\n\nIn a study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Public Health, researchers found the group had \"no significant changes in health conditions.\" They did report eating less venison after the whole ordeal. Otherwise, observed conditions, including vision loss, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, weight changes, hypertension and arthritis, were credited to old age.\n\nMore: Will deer with chronic wasting disease attack humans?\n\n\"It\u2019s the only study I\u2019m aware of that has this progressive follow-up of a known point source contamination where we know the people ate a contaminated animal,\" researcher Ralph Garruto, professor of biomedical and biological sciences at Binghamton University, told USA TODAY.\n\nGarruto said his team checks in with the group every two years and plans another follow-up in spring. Though he said the chance of symptoms appearing dwindles with time, there's a small possibility that someone might show signs of the disease.\n\n\"It only takes one case,\" he said.\n\nChronic wasting disease is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, reindeer, sika deer and moose.

Without them, she couldn't undergo lifesaving surgery. After azcentral investigated, she received good news. Rebekah L. Sanders, The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nPHOENIX \u2013 Caitlin Secrist, a 21-year-old college student blocked from lifesaving surgery because she can't get copies of her medical records, will receive the file after Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and a judge intervened Wednesday.\n\nSecrist can't eat, can't work, delayed her college graduation and is in constant pain because of acute pancreatitis. She wears a feeding tube around the clock and depends on handfuls of medications. More than a dozen hospitalizations later, the next pancreatitic attack could kill her.\n\nAll conventional treatments have failed. Secrist hopes a drastic surgery to completely remove her pancreas, spleen and appendix could help.\n\nBut a top doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital refuses to perform the operation without a complete understanding of Secrist's health history, including what her organs looked like when she was originally diagnosed, she said. Without the first scans taken in 2017, Secrist can't move forward.\n\nCaitlin Secrist, 21, and her parents Suzette and Bill are struggling to get Caitlin's medical records from a bankrupt Arizona hospital. On Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2019, a judge ruled that the way to get the records was to use the hospital's remaining assets. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)\n\nSecrist is among more than 300 patients who have tried and failed to get their medical records since Florence Hospital at Anthem and Gilbert Hospital went bankrupt and closed last summer, The Arizona Republicreported. Creditors have been bickering since then over who should cover the $92,000 needed to access the repossessed electronic-records system.\n\nFeb. 20: College student could die because she can't get copies of her medical records\n\nFeb. 11: Apple lets veterans track their health records on the iPhone\n\nAfter reading the Republicstory, Ducey directed his staff to see whether they could help Secrist obtain her records. Their efforts are underway.\n\n\"We've spoken with the patient's family and other outside organizations that could help with this to find any avenue possible to get these records to her,\" said Patrick Ptak, a spokesman for the governor.\n\nPleading her case in court\n\nSecrist and her parents drove an hour and a half from their Florence, Arizona, home to a court hearing on the impasse Wednesday, hoping to speak to the judge.\n\nSecrist had penned a heart-wrenching letter to Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Roger Brodman the day before. Her doctor also wrote the court, saying that Secrist was in \"dire need\" of the records.\n\nBrodman considered competing proposals to resolve the situation:\n\nMake patients pay potentially thousands of dollars for their records.\n\nSend the bill to former hospital executives.\n\nForce the electronic-records company to shoulder the costs.\n\nDig into hospital assets that otherwise would go to the senior creditor, a New York investment firm, which opposed the plan.\n\n\"Everybody agrees this is a critical issue,\" Brodman said. \"The hospital has the duty to produce the records. The inherent problem here is there is no hospital. The hospital has gone kaput.\"\n\nSecrist didn't get to speak during the court proceedings. But as it turned out, the judge didn't need Secrist's encouragement.\n\n\u201cEverybody agrees this is a critical issue. The hospital has the duty to produce the records. The inherent problem here is there is no hospital. The hospital has gone kaput.\u201d Judge Roger Brodman\n\nBrodman ruled quickly that the most efficient, fastest and probably least expensive option was to use remaining hospital assets.\n\nThat plan will reactivate the electronic-records system for 90 days, launch a publicity blitz to alert patients and hire employees to collect the records and respond to requests.\n\nIndigo-DLI Holdings, the New York lender that opposed the plan because it would eat into the money it would recoup from the hospitals, may appeal to stop the plan, attorney Kyle Hirsch said in court.\n\nHe was the only attorney in the lawsuit that has not expressed sympathy for patients.\n\n\"This is a very important issue,\" Hirsch told the judge. \"If the patients want their records they should pay a reasonable fee. ... But imposing the entire expense on Indigo doesn't seem fair.\"\n\nFor now, the plan will move forward.\n\nNext steps for patients\n\nIf all goes well, Secrist can expect to receive her file in two to three weeks, attorneys said.\n\nShe could get the records even faster if Ducey's office can locate her files through a third-party records vendor the state has a relationship with.\n\nAny patients who need records from Florence and Gilbert hospitals \u2014 and have not already requested them \u2014 should do so as soon as possible.\n\nThe window of opportunity to receive records is expected to be roughly March through May.\n\nCLOSE Caitlin Secrist is in constant pain from a severe illness, pancreatitis. And now she could die because she can't get copies of her medical records. Arizona Republic\n\n'It's a good feeling'\n\nSecrist and her parents said the decision was a \"big win\" for her and hundreds of other patients.\n\n\"It's a good feeling,\" Secrist said outside the courthouse. \"I can finally get those records and get on my way to getting better.\"\n\nAn aspiring nurse, Secrist hopes to schedule her surgery soon so she can get back to school and a more normal life.\n\nJan. 17: Johnson & Johnson teams with Apple study to help reduce the risk of strokes\n\nNov. 11: A $35,000 kidney stone?

It was way more than I expected.\"\n\nSolutions to broader problem\n\nSecrist's case poses the wider question of why Arizona patients were put at risk at all.\n\nDisputes between health care facilities and software and server companies over billing, access and obligations to patients have cropped up as medical records across the country have been moved online. There are not always clear answers in current federal and state law.\n\nFor instance, attorneys for Medhost, the electronic record company used by Florence and Gilbert hospitals, argued that it is not a \"health care provider\" and thus was not subject to records-retention regulations that apply to hospitals and doctors.\n\nAnd the Arizona Department of Health Services declined to intervene in the case despite requests from attorneys. It's not clear why.\n\nThe Governor's Office hopes to review state laws for possible loopholes that contributed to the quagmire, Ptak said.\n\n\"We are open to discussions about how to prevent something like this from happening in the future if a hospital were to close,\" he said.\n\nFollow Rebekah L.

But that's not enough. Congress must step in to hold abusers accountable.\n\nLast month, the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, lost heat and electricity for several days, forcing nearly 1,600 incarcerated men and women to endure paralyzingly cold temperatures.\n\nActivists and politicians denounced this inhumane treatment. Family members and friends \u2014 sick with worry about their loved ones inside \u2014 joined in the protests.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons and the warden of the Brooklyn facility are now being sued.\n\nThen, two weeks ago, news broke that incarcerated people had been drinking water with unsafe levels of arsenic at the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta. While initial tests were conducted in November, they weren\u2019t completed until recently because of delays caused by the federal government shutdown.\n\nEach person incarcerated in this country deserves basic rights, regardless of the circumstances that led to the incarceration. And Congress should exercise its oversight role and hold hearings to fully expose and understand the extent of prison negligence, and hold those accountable who continually perpetuate abuse.\n\nThe acting director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and newly minted Attorney General William Barr must work to pull bad actors from the system and put safeguards in place to ensure the fair treatment of people who are incarcerated.\n\nCaren Burton, of Bayshore, Long Island, holds a sign so her incarcerated son Tyrone Robinson can see it as she protests jail conditions from outside the Metropolitan Detention Center. Inmates were without heat, hot water, electricity and sanitation for several days. (Photo: Kathy Willens/AP)\n\nA long history of abuse\n\nIncidents like the ones in New York and Georgia are, unfortunately, nothing new. Incarcerated people across the country are routinely subjected to inhumane conditions.\n\nIn Mississippi, the state Department of Corrections was sued last year over extremely inhumane conditions that people were forced to endure for years, including excessive force and poor mental health care.\n\nYet another lawsuit was filed in Flint, Michigan. It stated that prison officials refused to hand out bottled water to and instead forced people locked up in the Genesee County Jail to drink tap water after they knew it was contaminated with lead.\n\nThese types of abuses are exacerbated in times of extreme weather. In 2017, incarcerated people at the Federal Correctional Institute in Beaumont, Texas, were left in their cells as the city flooded during Hurricane Harvey.\n\nIn South Carolina, Hurricane Florence prompted massive evacuations, yet reports showed that state officials chose not to evacuate some prisons in the hurricane\u2019s path. In Arizona, the Phoenix New Times reported that during the Summer of 2017, indoor temperatures in many Arizona prisons reached more than 100 degrees, with some temperatures rising as high as 113 degrees.\n\nFarther north, on Rikers Island, an infamous set of New York City jails, people have endured temperatures above 100 degrees with no central air in the summer and freezing cold temperatures in the winter. The air quality on Rikers has made people sick as the infrastructure built atop a landfill deteriorates. When Hurricane Sandy struck New York, incarcerated people were not evacuated from the sinking island. Dangerous conditions, exacerbated during extreme weather, remain a primary reason the entire 10-jail facility must be closed.\n\nInhumane penal conditions date to the beginnings of incarceration in America. In the 19th century, prisons were used as a new means for housing black people and forcing them, after slavery ended, to continue to provide free labor. The 13th Amendment banned involuntary servitude except as punishment for criminal conviction.\n\nOther nations do better, so can we\n\nLast year, JustLeadershipUSA joined a delegation of U.S. criminal justice reform organizations and corrections professionals who visited prison facilities in Germany and Norway.\n\nThe basic human rights of people in those institutions were respected. They were housed in clean facilities with access to good medical care and educational and recreational opportunities. They were given private time with their families as a matter of routine. The facilities were climate controlled; deprivation of heat was never a concern.\n\nConditions in the United States can and should be better. We cannot denounce human rights violations beyond our borders while tolerating and permitting such atrocities domestically. Surely, we can effectively protect incarcerated people from life-threatening weather, drinking water contamination and other appalling conditions.\n\nRaising awareness and publicly denouncing human rights abuses such as those that took place most recently in Atlanta and Brooklyn is important. But as long as our country sees incarcerated people as second-class citizens undeserving of human dignity, we will never address the ongoing pattern of racial injustice, negligence and dehumanization.\n\nDeAnna R.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nDuke star freshman Zion Williamson is listed as \"day-to-day\" while he recovers from a Grade 1 knee sprain, the school announced on Thursday.\n\nLess than a minute into the Blue Devils' 88-72 loss to North Carolina on Wednesday, Williamson suffered the right knee sprain on a bizarre play that saw the 6-7 forward's shoe blow apart when he planted his foot.\n\nHe immediately clutched at his legs upon going down, and shortly after went to the locker room. Duke then announced that he was shut down for the rest of the game and afterwards coach Mike Krzyzewski told the media that the injury was a \"mild sprain\" and that Williamson's knee was \"stable.\"\n\nDuke Blue Devils forward Zion Williamson (1) reacts after falling during the first half against the North Carolina Tar Heels at Cameron Indoor Stadium.

If Williamson is back to full strength by Selection Sunday, the selection committee will provide leeway for any outcomes that occur with the national player of the year candidate out of the lineup. The team has five regular-season contests before the ACC tournament tips off.\n\nDuke, North Carolina and Virginia are in a three-way tie for first place in the ACC title race. The Blue Devils face a Syracuse team they lost to earlier this season at 6 p.m. ET on Saturday. Duke is 1-1 without Williamson since he missed almost all of the team's last-second win over Florida State earlier this season."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/21/los-angeles-snow-snow-falls-hollywood-pasadena-malibu/2943525002/", "text": "CLOSE Parts of Los Angeles saw hail coming down as a big blast of cold air moves into Southern California.

But I want to ask everyone feeling angry, hurt and disappointed to channel those emotions into productive activism \u2014 because there are thousands who are targeted by hate violence each year who need our help.\n\nThe rising tide of hate violence has had a devastating impact on black people, LGBTQ people, religious minorities and those living at the intersections. At least 26 transgender people were killed in 2018 alone \u2014 and many were clearly bias-motivated crimes.\n\nStopping the epidemic of hate violence will require concrete action from lawmakers through improved and mandatory reporting of all hate crimes (hate crime reporting by local authorities is voluntary), passage of state laws that protect LGBTQ people, and expanded education and training for law enforcement. It also requires that we create a climate where survivors are believed and empowered to come forward knowing their crimes will be thoroughly investigated.\n\nPlease join me in calling for action on policies that can end this scourge of violence and calling attention to people impacted by hate violence already this year:\n\n\u25baLast month in Houston, Candice Elease Pinky \u2014 a black trans woman \u2014 was chased down, shot several times in broad daylight, and left in a gas station parking lot.\n\n\u25baElizabeth Cole, a transgender woman from, Henderson, Nevada, was shot in the neck by her neighbor.\n\n\u25baIn Austin, Texas, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry \u2014 a gay couple \u2014 were severely beaten outside a bar.\n\n\u25ba In Montgomery, Alabama, Dana Martin \u2014 a black trans woman \u2014 was found brutally murdered, and officials continue to misgender her to the public.\n\nChad Griffin is president of the Human Rights Campaign.

If it\u2019s true that Smollett staged this attack, he will have made it all the more challenging for the next actual victim of such violence to be heard and believed. The surrounding furor could even deter victims from reporting. That kind of harm is concrete and tangible. Real people will suffer.\"\n\nNew York City Anti-Violence Project, statement: \"The clients who walk into our offices every day are surviving a culture of violence against LGBTQ people, especially people of color and those of trans experience. It's unfortunate if anyone, especially someone with this large of a platform, would falsify any parts of a story of hate violence. Still, the reality is that far too many survivors aren't believed and don't get justice for the violence they experience. That's why we are quick to affirm and believe survivors when they share their stories.\"\n\nMegan McArdle, The Washington Post: \"Bogus attacks may feel more authentic than actual ones because, luckily, most of us know these extreme forms of violence only from what we\u2019ve seen on-screen. We amplify stories that tickle our narrative neurons, overlooking more complicated real attacks where the significance must be explained. This does a grave disservice to real victims.

USA TODAY\n\nAfter USA TODAY Network published a review of more than 900 yearbooks, which found a plurality of racist images, our readers had some thoughts.\n\nUSA TODAY Network began a nationwide review of college yearbooks after startling images of blackface and a Ku Klux Klan hood were discovered on the 1984 medical school yearbook page of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\nWhy do this investigation at all?\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nSomeone at USA TODAY had the bright idea of sending a herd of reporters to look at yearbooks only for images that are now deemed racial.\n\nThe search was no doubt successful, but why was it done in the first place? The only reason I can think of is to stir up racial tensions. Why?\n\nFor eight years, America had a bi-racial president, and more African-Americans are serving in Congress and in their communities.\n\nAre race relations perfect? Probably not, but looking at countries all around the world, I think it's safe to say that most have racial or religious tensions at varying degrees. However, I don't think that there's a country on earth that has done more to ensure equality with all of its citizens than America has.\n\nSo, again, the reason for digging up 30-40+ year old photos is?\n\nTom Reeves; Auburndale, Fla.\n\nRead USA TODAY's investigation: Blackface, KKK hoods and mock lynchings: Review of 900 yearbooks finds blatant racism\n\nThis is telling of the racial climate that prevails today\n\nComments and tweets are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nI'm not surprised by the findings of USA TODAY's investigation. I always felt that this just the tip of the iceberg. I'm sure that a lot of racism and discrimination took place on many college campuses. The research done and revealed is so telling of the racial climate and attitudes which prevailed in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, and still prevails today.\n\n\u2014 Florence Graydon\n\nIt's so strange that racist imagery could be so common in our yearbooks, yet I had no idea about it, probably due to the fact that I doubt these people would be comfortable being so blatantly racist, if they had even one black person in the room.\n\n\u2014 @kahlildozier\n\nRacism is worldwide and it comes in all shapes and sizes. The Irish were enslaved and nearly wiped out by the English. The Jews were nearly eliminated by the Germans. Africans fought each other and sold captured tribes into slavery. America is not unique in its struggles dealing with racism.\n\nIt is time to put the past behind and move forward as one nation.

Just this week a paper in Alabama had an editorial where a person is requesting a Ku Klux Klan terrorist action against people now!

If only I could have been as courageous in acknowledging them in our yearbook.\n\nIf you are a white southerner like me, you might have done what I did last week. I pulled my dusty yearbooks off the shelf to look for pictorial evidence of the racism that pervaded my childhood in Jackson, Mississippi. This I did with a heightened trepidation, because I was the editor of my 1966 high school yearbook.\n\nThere were no blackface photos, thank goodness. But I found something I'm ashamed of all the same.\n\nBeing named yearbook editor was important to me, but it was not the most life-changing thing that happened my senior year. For that, I credit eight classmates who bravely followed in the footsteps of the more famous Little Rock Nine, who desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957.\n\nUSA TODAY editor in chief: I became part of our story on racist images in college yearbooks. I'm here to apologize for publishing that photo\n\nThe \u201cMurrah High School Eight,\u201d as we called them, came along almost a decade later, because Mississippi officials more fiercely resisted the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate that separate was not equal. For that reason, I attended segregated public schools for 11 grades \u2014 all while Brown v. Board of Education was supposed to be the law of the land.\n\nSchool integration in 1960s America\n\nMy parents taught me this was wrong, so as a teenager I started getting quietly involved in the civil rights movement \u2014 working, for example, as a teacher aide in the first Head Start program in the 1960s. That\u2019s how I got invited by the local NAACP chapter president to meet with the Murrah Eight before school started.\n\nThe author's yearbook of the 1965-66 school year. (Photo: Family handout)\n\nThey wanted to know what to expect, and frankly, I was terrified for them. The best they could expect was to be ostracized by almost everyone, to be excluded from all activities except their classes, to be ignored or bullied by some teachers who had made their racist views well known to us white students.\n\nRead the USA TODAY investigation: Blackface, KKK hoods and mock lynchings: Review of 900 yearbooks finds blatant racism\n\nI tried not even to imagine what might be the worst they could expect. It was 1965. This was barely a year after the murders and church bombings of Freedom Summer, and just two years after Medgar Evers was gunned down in his driveway a couple of miles from my home.\n\nI could not imagine having their sheer courage. As the first day of school approached, I took to praying for them every night. I was praying for me, too. I was praying I might have the courage \u2014 just a small fraction of theirs, of course, but enough to stand up for my convictions on that first day of school, enough to openly welcome my new classmates, to sit with them at lunch, to be shunned by my friends and maybe worse.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nVirginia's blackface meltdown shows how slavery and tribalism still warp our politics\n\nWhy politicians shouldn't always be purged over past blackface incidents\n\nI did muster the courage of my convictions that day, but as for my eight new classmates, they endured a miserably difficult senior year. My friend Brenda White Swaggard told me recently \u2014 a full half-century later \u2014 that sometimes the psychic wounds still feel fresh. But Brenda and all the Murrah Eight persevered to become my high school\u2019s first black graduates.\n\nOmitted from the yearbook \u2014 yet another insult\n\nTheir courage inspires me to this day. Indeed, I credit their example for setting me on my life course as a civil rights and civil legal aid lawyer.\n\nSo my heart sank last week to be reminded that the story of the Murrah Eight is nowhere to be found in the pages of the yearbook I edited. Some of their photos are in the \"seniors\" section of the yearbook, but nothing explicit about their heroism or their challenges. A few vague references in the opening photo essay \u2014 to the effect that \u201cMurrah faced changes\u201d in the \u201cgreat national quest for civil rights\u201d \u2014 were all I dared submit for approval to my faculty sponsors. I might have been right that they would have rejected any more explicit reference to the most momentous thing that happened to us that year, but I didn\u2019t make the ask.\n\nSure, no blackface photos, but there is more than one way for a yearbook to do damage.\n\nIt is too late to re-edit old yearbooks. But as events of recent weeks attest, it is high time to unearth the stories that still need telling and to rededicate ourselves to our longstanding quest to eliminate race discrimination root and branch. It is a quest both national and personal. Let\u2019s don\u2019t miss the opportunity to call ourselves \u2014 as well as our elected leaders \u2014 to account.\n\nMartha Bergmark is executive director of Voices for Civil Justice and was founding president and CEO of Mississippi Center for Justice.

In one of the most striking images \u2013 from the 1981 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign yearbook \u2013 a black man is smiling and holding a beer while posing with three people in full KKK regalia.\n\nReporters collected more than 200 examples of offensive or racist material at colleges in 25 states, from large public universities in the South, to Ivy League schools in the Northeast, liberal arts boutiques and Division I powerhouses.\n\nSTORY BEHIND THE STORY: How \u2014 and why \u2014 we reviewed 900 yearbooks\n\n\n\nThe yearbook photos reflect campus communities that tolerated open displays of racism at the parties they attended, parades they marched in and posters they hung \u2013 despite the hard-learned lessons of the civil rights movement they grew up with. In almost every picture, people appear happy.\n\n\n\nMinority students from that era say the comfort with public behavior that would likely meet swift condemnation today further marginalized minorities on campus. And the choice to publish the images for posterity cut even deeper.\n\n\n\nCassandra Thomas, a black student at the University of Texas in the late 1970s, remembers seeing the photograph of someone wearing a KKK costume draped in a Confederate flag in her yearbook. But she felt she had no recourse on a campus where an almost all-white student body and administration decided what was acceptable and what wasn\u2019t.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was about keeping your head down,\u201d said Thomas, 60. \u201cWe were trying to get our degree and get out with the least amount of trouble.\u201d\n\nThe volume of shocking imagery found in the examination, which was not comprehensive, suggests that there are likely more yearbooks that recorded racism on campuses nationwide \u2013 and countless more acts never captured on camera or submitted for publication.\n\nThe review also gives new perspective to an array of cases that have emerged since reports showed that Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's 1984 medical school yearbook page features a person wearing blackface and another in a KKK hood. The image, uncovered in early February, has endangered Northam\u2019s career and galvanized student newspapers and local outlets around the country to dig up other cases of politicians in racist situations.\n\nNo politicians were identified by USA TODAY Network\u2019s review, which focused on the same time period as Northam\u2019s yearbook, in the era after sweeping civil rights reform. Few images had captions to provide names or context and people\u2019s faces were often hidden behind hoods or blackface.\n\nIn one yearbook, from Arizona State University, reporters discovered that USA TODAY Editor Nicole Carroll had designed a page that included a photo of two people, at a fraternity\u2019s Halloween party, in black makeup as actress Robin Givens and boxer Mike Tyson. Carroll, who was editor of the yearbook in 1989 when the photo ran, expressed regret after learning of the photo.\n\nEDITOR'S COLUMN: I became part of our story on racist images. I'm here to apologize for publishing that\n\nFROM ARIZONA: More on the yearbook\n\n\n\n\u201cI was shocked when a colleague told me of my role in publishing a racist and hurtful photo in my college yearbook,\u201d Carroll said in a statement. \u201cI am truly sorry for the harm my ignorance caused then, and the hurt it will cause now, 30 years later.\u201d\n\nImages pulled from multiple yearbooks reviewed by USA TODAY. None\n\nExperts say that even if school officials don\u2019t have direct oversight over the yearbooks, responsibility rests with the entire institution: A campus culture that fostered racist behavior; yearbook staffs that chose to memorialize it; and administrations that failed to condemn the images when they were published for the world to see.\n\nAndre M. Perry, a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, has studied his alma mater\u2019s yearbooks at the University of Maryland. He said racism in higher education has a way of involving everyone on campus, so he wasn\u2019t surprised to see it documented so regularly.\n\n\u201cThe way to fit in, sadly, is to make fun of black people,\u201d Perry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unifying act. It\u2019s sad but racism pulls people, particularly white people, together.\u201d\n\nThe yearbooks in the USA TODAY Network examination also show students saluting in Nazi uniforms on Halloween or wearing orange paint and a headdress to depict a stereotype of a Native American on game day. There are \u201cslave sale\u201d fundraisers that auctioned off young women, \u201cplantation parties\u201d and a \u201csharecroppers ball.\u201d One picture shows a swastika banner hung up on what appears to be a dormitory wall.\n\nBut the vast majority of the offensive material show racist imagery, such as students in blackface or KKK robes, sometimes just pages away or even alongside images of minority students and university leaders.\n\nBLACKFACE: What it means and why it won't go away\n\nRead more: Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam slammed for referring to 'first indentured servants from Africa' instead of slaves\n\nSince the Northam news broke, Steve LaCarter, 64, said he has been waiting for a phone call about the party he and his fraternity friends threw at the University of South Carolina in the 1976 school year. They put shoe polish on their faces, wore matching pink suits and lip synced soul music on stage. Someone took a picture, which he said he keeps in a bible at home along with other old photographs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I harmed anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were no black people in the room watching that.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t know the yearbook had published it, which seemed to recalibrate his position.\n\n\u201cI can see that, for black people, even in the '70s, seeing that in the University of South Carolina yearbook, that\u2019s not right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think about that. I didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d\n\nSimilar scenes are splashed across the yearbooks: There are white people dressed up as Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Aunt Jemima for skits. A \u201csleazy pimp\u201d in blackface at a fraternity\u2019s \u201cPimps and Whores\u201d party. Some students painted their face like 19th-century minstrel shows. Others marched in parades wearing blackface. Groups of friends put on KKK robes for costume parties and Halloween.\n\n\u201cIf you dress like that for Halloween and you knock on the door of a black family, how would they perceive your costume?\u201d said Mia Moody-Ramirez, a professor at Baylor University who researches depictions of race and gender in the media. \u201cWould you still feel as comfortable if you\u2019re in the company of African-Americans and you\u2019re wearing blackface?\"\n\nAs more offensive images surface from yearbooks, Americans are trying to weigh how to reckon past actions with today\u2019s cultural norms, sharpened by more empowered minorities and social consciousness.\n\nImages pulled from multiple yearbooks reviewed by USA TODAY. None\n\nExperts said this is an opportunity for colleges not only to address the past, but also to focus on the racial inequalities that are still present on campus, just better hidden and more readily cast as separate from the school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forbid things when you know they\u2019re going on behind closed doors,\u201d Perry said.\n\nHilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington Bureau, said there is likely a range of intentions behind all of the photographs. The students in blackface dressing up for Halloween as a favorite black celebrity may have been trying to be funny and were just insensitive or oblivious to the harm they caused. The ones in KKK robes, or those who used blackface in a mocking way, might have worse motivations.\n\n\u201cThey can argue they were ignorant to it, but it was still racist,\u201d Shelton said. The more meaningful distinction is how those same people respond in retrospect \u2013 whether they accept responsibility and apologize or deny having done something wrong.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bigger problem,\u201d said Shelton. \u201cIgnorant arrogance, which is a very dangerous thing.\u201d\n\n\"How does that get into the yearbook?\"\n\nUSA TODAY Network reached out to each university and fraternity named in this story where reporters found offensive pictures in yearbooks.\n\nNearly every president or spokesperson condemned the images as antithetical to school values and said they\u2019ve taken steps over the years to become more inclusive, distancing themselves from the past while also acknowledging history\u2019s stain on the campus.\n\n\u201cMany of these photos are extremely offensive and painful to view,\u201d Jim Ryan, president of the University of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cBut while the photos themselves are shocking, their existence is not.\u201d\n\nImages pulled from multiple yearbooks reviewed by USA TODAY. None\n\nBut experts say schools have a long way to go to solve disparities still entrenched in higher education today.\n\n\u201cThe patterns of behavior in place in 1975 are not perhaps that different,\u201d said psychologist Beverly Daniel Tatum, a former Spelman College president who graduated from Wesleyan University that year and has since written several books about racism in education.\n\nSome universities, including American, Elon and Wake Forest, released findings from their own internal reviews to identify offensive images in past yearbooks.\n\nOn the New York school\u2019s 150th anniversary in 1979, the Rochester Institute of Technology yearbook published a photo of nine students in KKK robes, one holding a noose. The photo is grainy, which makes it difficult to know for certain, but posing with them is either a white student in blackface or a black student.\n\nThe school blocked access to its digital archive on the web after receiving inquiries from a reporter.\n\n\u201cWe find the photos highly offensive and not reflective of today\u2019s RIT,\u201d spokeswoman Ellen Rosen explained in an email, \u201cso we did not want them easily shared.\u201d\n\nTom Grotta, who now owns and curates a contemporary art gallery with his wife, was the editor of the RIT yearbook in 1979. He said the school was a progressive campus with little racial tension and that he did not remember including the photograph.\n\nAfter viewing the photo, which shares a page with photos from a Halloween party, Grotta suspected that the students had just acted in a play because of the canvas wall behind them. Like the vast majority of the images reviewed by USA TODAY, it has no caption and very little context outside of other photos around it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret the picture,\u201d Grotta said. \u201cI regret not having a caption.\u201d\n\nAt Cornell, the Sigma Nu fraternity submitted KKK and Nazi references instead of the members\u2019 names for captions in their 1980 yearbook photo.\n\nImages pulled from multiple yearbooks reviewed by USA TODAY. None\n\nThree former fraternity members at the time, including two who are Jewish, said they hadn\u2019t seen the yearbook page until a USA TODAY reporter emailed it to them. Both said they never felt hostility from peers at the fraternity \u2013 even if some were less welcoming than others \u2013 but were stunned to learn what had been published.\n\n\u201cI lived in the house with all these guys,\u201d said Eric Babat, a freshman at the time and now an attorney in New York. \u201cHow does that get into the yearbook without somebody flagging it? I don\u2019t understand. This was in the Cornell yearbook?\u201d\n\nSigma Nu spokesman Drew Logsdon denounced the \u201cdeeply offensive images\u201d in a statement.\n\nAfter publication, Martha Pollack, the president of Cornell University, denounced the captions. A spokesman for the university had initially declined to comment.\n\nA Tradition of Racism\n\nThough many colleges began prohibiting Confederate flag displays on campus decades ago, Confederate imagery remains a part of the fabric at some schools in the South.\n\nFor generations, the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity at schools across the South, including the University of South Carolina and Auburn University, maintained traditions of the \u201cOld South\u201d with parades and parties in Confederate clothing and flags, some the size of a basketball court, all recorded in dozens of yearbooks.\n\nThe fraternity has since banned the display of the flags, and in 2010 prohibited members from wearing Confederate uniforms at events. Kappa Alpha Order spokesman Jesse S. Lyons said in a statement that the racist acts documented at fraternity parties \u201care not appropriate at any time, do not reflect who we are, and would not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nRead More: In blackface controversy, Virginia remains haunted by its Confederate past\n\nAt the University of Texas, prejudice at the school was so acute and institutionalized that some professors lectured about black inferiority in the classrooms, former student Cassandra Thomas recalled.\n\nThomas shared another moment that stung: Her white roommate freshman year moved out immediately after discovering she had been paired with a black student. She said she could go a whole day without seeing another person of color.\n\n\u201cWe weren't trying to change the world then the way we would do it today,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nWhile southern schools may be the crucible for racist customs, the photos captured by the USA TODAY review show they extend to other parts of the country as well.\n\nIn schools across the Midwest and North, campuses often touted as bastions of liberalism and tolerance, yearbooks chronicle some of the same displays.\n\nUntil 1969, the University of Vermont celebrated a \u201cKake Walk\u201d festival that featured white students who dressed in blackface as an homage to minstrel shows. But references to it, including blackface, emerged in the yearbooks in the following decades.\n\nMinstrel shows had helped perpetuate negative stereotypes about black people \u2013 who weren\u2019t allowed to play themselves \u2013 before the growing black political and social power of the civil rights movement squashed it from popular culture in the 1960s.\n\nExperts say those same sort of displays can show the extreme power structures on campuses today, where the pressure to conform and protect yourself often outweighs your sense of injustice.\n\n\u201cPeople ask, 'Why are the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?\u2019\u201d said Beverly Daniel Tatum, the psychologist and author. \u201cIt\u2019s because they are protecting themselves from this kind of toxic environment.\u201d\n\nReporters found five examples of black students appearing in or alongside KKK robes, including the 1981 Illinois photograph from a Halloween party.\n\n\u201cAs a black or brown student, you have to navigate those social relationships: Try to fit in or get punished by that same social structure?\u201d said Andre M. Perry at the Brookings Institution. \u201cMany students just grin and bear it. They know deep down this is wrong; they\u2019re making fun of people like me.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Barkstall, 57, was one of few black students who attended Illinois at the time the yearbook published the picture of a black man, who is not identified, posing with three individuals hidden by KKK outfits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure at the time they probably thought that was funny,\u201d said Barkstall, now a realtor in Illinois.\n\nHe paused for a moment to consider his time at college almost 40 years ago and whether he might have known who was behind the Klan hoods.\n\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be senators under those masks.\u201d\n\nWith contributions from: Elisha Anderson, David Andreatta, Rachel Axon, Clairissa Baker, Dave Bangert, Megan Banta, John Barry, Natasha Blakely, Bonnie Bolden, Giacomo Bologna, Anthony Borrelli, Katie Sullivan Borrelli, Matt Brannon, Mary Chao, Trish Choate, Ellen Ciurczak, Mark Curnutte, Nicole Higgins DeSmet, Michael Diamond, Will DiGravio, Byron Dobson, Bob Dohr, Alana Edgin, Allison Ehrlich, Rilyn Eischens, Kirsten Fiscus, Maggie Gilroy, Jason Gonzales, Emily Havens, Holly Hays, Samantha Hernandez, Brinley Hineman, Brandon Holveck, Tyler Horka, Stephanie Ingersoll, Kyle Jones, Sara Karnes, Monica Kast, Corinne Kennedy, Cameron Knight, Rachel Leingang, Dann Miller, Trevor Mitchell, Justin Murphy, Amanda Oglesby, Tovah Olson, Darrin Peschka, Dan Radel, Gege Reed, Mike Reicher, Gus Garcia-Roberts, Peggy Santoro, Jeff Schwaner, Caryn Shaffer, Devi Shastri, Svetlana Shkolnikova, Georgie Silvarole, Mollie Simon, Seth Slabaugh, Nichelle Smith, Zachary Smith, Matt Steecker, Joe Szydlowski, Sarah Taddeo, Jason Truitt, Natasha Vaughn, Rose Velazquez, Katie Wadington, Tom Whitehurst Jr. and Candy Woodall"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/02/21/pope-francis-sex-abuse-summit-bishops-act-now-end-scourge-abuse/2936247002/", "text": "CLOSE As Pope Francis holds a summit on clergy sex abuse at the Vatican, survivors are demanding accountability and transparency from church leaders and assert that the time of sex abuse cover-ups is over. (Feb. 21) AP\n\nPope Francis urged high-ranking church officials from around the globe gathered Thursday at the Vatican to \"hear the cry of the little ones\" who are victims of sexual abuse by priests.\n\nFrancis spoke at the beginning of a four-day summit that brought together almost 200 high-ranking church officials, including leaders of bishop conferences from more than 100 nations. The summit will focus on making bishops aware of their responsibilities regarding sexual abuse, as well as accountability and transparency, the Vatican said.\n\nThe pope cited the \"scourge\" of sexual abuse and said it was the responsibility of church leaders to \"confront this evil afflicting the Church and humanity.\"\n\nFrancis offered 21 proposals for the clergy to weigh. Some would require new laws; others would be easier to adopt.\n\n\"The holy people of God look to us and expect from us not simple and predictable condemnations but concrete and effective measures to be undertaken,\" he said. \"We need to be concrete.\"\n\nThe summit began with an African woman who was not identified recounting how her priest raped her and forced her to have three abortions over a dozen years after he started violating her at age 15.\n\nIt ended with Colombian Cardinal Rub\u00e9n Salazar G\u00f3mez warning the clergy that they could all face prison if they let such crimes go unpunished.\n\nLast week, Francis defrocked former U.S. cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88, after Vatican officials found him guilty of sex crimes against minors and adults. McCarrick is the most senior Catholic official to be defrocked for such crimes.\n\nExperts said McCarrick's case sends an important signal that even cardinals and powerful archbishops will be held accountable.\n\nMore than 30 years after the scandal first erupted in Ireland and Australia and 20 years after it hit the USA, bishops and Catholic officials in many parts of Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia still either deny that clergy sex abuse exists in their regions or downplay the problem.\n\nFrancis, the first Latin American pope, called the summit after drawing sharp criticism for his handling of a wide-ranging sex abuse coverup case in Chile last year. He vowed to demand accountability from church leadership.\n\nAmong the proposals Francis offered were protocols for accusations against bishops \u2013 a reference to the McCarrick scandal \u2013 and directions for transferring seminarians or priests to prevent predators from moving freely among parishes.\n\nPope Francis attends the opening of a global summit aimed at protecting children from sexual abuse. (Photo: Handout, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTuesday, two groups representing the leadership of Catholic religious orders apologized for their failure to quickly act to halt sexual abuse.\n\n\"We bow our heads in shame at the realization that such abuse has taken place in our congregations and orders, and in our church,\" said the statement from the Union of Superiors General and its female counterpart, the International Union of Superiors General.\n\nAbuse survivors came to Rome to demand accountability, and organizers of the summit met with some of them Wednesday.\n\nPhil Saviano, who helped expose the U.S. abuse scandal by priests two decades ago, demanded that the Vatican release the names of abusers and their files.\n\n\u201cDo it to break the code of silence,\u201d he told the organizing committee on the eve of the summit. \u201cDo it out of respect for the victims of these men, and do it to help prevent these creeps from abusing any more children.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/02/21/pope-francis-sex-abuse-summit-bishops-act-now-end-scourge-abuse/2936247002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2019/02/21/jim-boeheim-syracuse-crash/2937156002/", "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: Rochester Democrat and Chronicle's Steve Bradley details how Jim Boeheim killed a pedestrian in a car crash and the affect on the team.

Mark Hoffman/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nBut in late 2014, farm milk prices started to plummet. The downturn, fueled by overproduction and failing export markets, has lasted more than four years and has wiped out dairy farms from Maine to California.\n\nThe price farmers receive for their milk has fallen nearly 40 percent.\n\n\"This downward cycle has been brutal,\" said Kevin Schoessow, a University of Wisconsin-Extension agent in Washburn County.\n\nWisconsin lost almost 700 dairy farms in 2018, an unprecedented rate of nearly two a day. Most were small operations unable to survive farm milk prices that, adjusted for inflation, were among the lowest in a half-century.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, Wisconsin had 8,046 dairy herds, down 40 percent from 10 years earlier, according to state Department of Agriculture data.\n\nRemaining dairy farmers have burned through their farm equity and credit to remain in business. Often, at least one family member works an off-farm job to put groceries on the table or pay for health insurance. Some work double shifts, farming during the day then heading to a local factory for the night. It's exhausting, but it keeps families in agriculture and preserves a cherished way of life.\n\nMuch of Wisconsin's $88 billion farm economy hangs in the balance. Hundreds of towns across the state depend on the money that dairy farmers spend at equipment dealerships, feed mills, hardware stores, cafes and scores of other businesses.\n\nEach dollar of net farm income results in an additional 60 cents of economic activity, according to University of Wisconsin research.\n\nThis spring, though, farmers face crucial decisions. Some are running out of feed for their cattle. Do they seek operating loans to plant crops for livestock rations? Or do they quit and cut their losses that can add up to thousands of dollars a month?\n\nOften the fate of their livelihood isn't in their hands.\n\n\"Banks are wary of taking on more risk,\" said Michael Slattery, an economic adviser for Wisconsin Farmers Union, a trade group based in Chippewa Falls.\n\nNearly every dollar the Spauldings have earned from their milk the last few years has gone toward their debts and farm insurance, leaving them with little income except for Chuck's Social Security check and selling some livestock and hay.\n\nTheir milk checks, after deductions are taken out, come imprinted: \u201cVoid.\"\n\nA check from the dairy cooperative is shown voided because the bank has first dibs on money from the milk sold by S & S Dairy. Mark Hoffman, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\n\u201cIt's been such a struggle just to keep things going,\u201d Sue said. \u201cWe have managed, but now it is getting hard to pay even our basic everyday bills. I don\u2019t know how much longer we can do this.\u201d\n\nAs Sue spoke, she faced a $900 electric bill due in only four days. The barn needs repairs and there's farm equipment that should have been replaced long ago.\n\n\u201cWe are running out of resources,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to sit here and watch things fall apart.\u201d\n\nHow Wisconsin became 'America's Dairyland'\n\nWisconsin didn\u2019t start out as a dairy state.\n\nIn the mid-1800s, one-sixth of the wheat grown in the United States came from Wisconsin. White settlers from the East Coast didn\u2019t need much initial investment and found the crop easy to manage.\n\nBut varying yields, rising competition from neighboring states and an insect infestation forced wheat farmers to consider alternatives. Dairy farming emerged in the latter half of the century as a better fit for the state\u2019s terrain and climate.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, 90 percent of Wisconsin farms had dairy cows, and by World War I the state led the nation in butter and cheese production. It held the milk production title until 1993 when that recognition went to California.\n\nWisconsin, though, remains No. 1 in terms of connecting dairy with its cultural identity.\n\nFor nearly 80 years, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dairyland\u201d has been imprinted on the state\u2019s license plates. And for the last four decades, foam Cheesehead wedges have been a staple at sporting events and in tourist shops. Dairy contributes more to Wisconsin\u2019s economy than citrus does to Florida or potatoes to Idaho, and more than a quarter of the nation\u2019s cheese comes out of the state.\n\nFor all the pride Wisconsin takes in its heritage, some national consumer trends have been headed in a different direction. Sales of milk as a beverage have fallen steadily since the 1970s, with fewer parents encouraging their children to drink milk than ever before. Soy milk and almond milk \u2014 which dairy farmers point out aren't real milk \u2014 and scores of sports drinks have flooded the beverage market.\n\nFollow four Wisconsin farms Amid years of sagging milk prices, Wisconsin dairy farms face a grim future. Meet the operators of four farms across the state we are following this year.\n\nAnd although consumption of cheese, yogurt and butter have all increased, they've not always kept pace with runaway production. Today, for instance, U.S. commercial and government cheese stockpiles are at about 1 billion pounds \u2014 the highest level in a century.\n\nAt the same time, foreign markets for American dairy products have shrunk in response to tariffs that President Donald Trump placed on foreign steel and aluminum. Cheese shipments to China have fallen almost 65 percent, according to industry figures, and exports to Mexico are down more than 10 percent.\n\nMexico and Canada have targeted rural America as a way to punish Trump, and the economic harm could be felt for years to come, said Laurie Fischer, CEO of the American Dairy Coalition.\n\n\"This should have changed in November when Trump declared success with his newly rechristened U.S.-Canada-Mexico Trade Agreement replacing NAFTA,\" Fischer said.\n\n\"In retrospect, it was a disingenuous statement: The administration has not lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexican and Canadian products, and in response, those countries are refusing to (ratify) the pact or lift retaliatory tariffs, impacting dairy products and other items.\"\n\nWisconsin farmers are getting about $10 million in payments from Trump\u2019s farm bailout program announced late last year. It was designed to help producers of milk, pork, soybeans, corn and other commodities who have seen prices tumble in trade battles.\n\nA 55-cow dairy farm would receive a one-time payment of $725 from the bailout but stood to lose between $36,000 and $48,000 in income last year from low milk prices, according to the Wisconsin Farmers Union. A 290-cow dairy would get $4,905 but would lose several hundred thousand dollars.\n\nFurther, dairy farmers have only been getting about 25 percent of the average retail price for cheese, the lowest portion since 2012, according to Fischer.\n\n\"There's no magic bullet on the horizon,\u201d she said. \u201cA shakeout will continue in the dairy sector until markets stabilize and supply and demand realign. Until then, dairy professionals at all levels are working on a day-by-day, if not hour-by-hour, basis to keep their operations afloat.\"\n\nFarmers hurt from being too productive\n\nThe prices farmers receive for their unprocessed, unpasteurized milk are largely determined by the forces of supply and demand, and government programs.\n\nMinimum prices are set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture using complicated formulas based on the wholesale market value of various dairy products such as cheese, butter and whey.\n\nMany farmers see themselves as pawns in an agricultural system stacked against them. Faced with few options to control the price for what they produce, they ramp up production and hope markets don't buckle under the strain.\n\nDairy farmers don't even know what they'll be paid for their milk until 30 days after it's hauled off the farm.\n\n\"Every time we see the price go up a little it makes us very hopeful. And then when it drops ... everybody goes back to feeling pretty awful,\" Fischer said.\n\nIn 2012, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced an incentive program to produce, as a state, 30 billion pounds of milk a year by 2020 \u2014 a 15 percent increase. The state offered farmers grants for business planning, facility engineering and animal nutrition. The program, \"Grow Wisconsin Dairy 30x20,\u201d required them to put up their own money as well.\n\nDespite record production every year since 2002, Walker urged farmers to step it up even more. \u201cThe reality,\" he said, \"is the growth is not fast enough for the opportunities that are here before us.\"\n\nDairy farmers not only met the challenge, they reached 30 billion pounds in 2016 \u2014 four years ahead of schedule.\n\nBy then, however, the market had turned and many dairy farmers were having trouble breaking even on their new investments.\n\nSome felt duped by the agribusiness system.\n\n\u201cThe more surplus farmers produce, the lower the price of agricultural commodities for food processors,\" said Kara O'Connor, government relations director for the Wisconsin Farmers Union.\n\n\"All of the most powerful players in the industry, except the farmer, benefit from overproduction.\"\n\nThe amount farmers are paid for their milk varies monthly based on the USDA price, individual contracts, quality and other factors. Some farmers say they've been getting around $15 for every hundred pounds of milk they produce, roughly 12 gallons. Their costs: $20 or higher.\n\nThese are like prices from 40 years ago, said Dennis Rosen, who recently quit milking cows at his St. Croix County farm.\n\nBack then, there were 39 dairy farms within 20 miles of Rosen's home. Of those farms, only three are left.\n\n\u201cWe used to live in a very vibrant area of family agriculture,\u201d he said.\n\nWith collapsed prices of milk, grain and other commodities, many farmers have lost money for months at a time. At some point, the losses become unsustainable.\n\n\u201cJust ask any of the 36 dairy farmers who are no longer farming in my neck of the woods today,\u201d Rosen said.\n\nSome farmers have flushed milk down the barn drain because they couldn't find a processing plant to take it.\n\nThat happened in January at Laura Binder\u2019s 70-cow dairy farm near Marshfield.\n\n\u201cWe no longer have a dairy plant to ship to, so we are dumping our milk,\u201d Laura said. \"What a waste of money.\"\n\nFarm auctions have become an all too common occurrence in her area.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any better,\u201d she said. \"I just think it's going to keep going down until all that's left are mega-size farms. There won't be any place for little farms.\"\n\nSome farmers have shot calves because the newborn animals had no market value and were considered too expensive to raise for beef.\n\nIn December, an Iowa farmer posted Facebook photos of calves he'd killed, trying to make a point of how desperate things were. Shortly afterward his milk cooperative, Prairie Farms, dropped him as a member, according to Steven Potter, the farmer's brother in Preston, Iowa.\n\n\"I don't know what he was thinking,\" Potter said.\n\nMore Wisconsin farmers are calling Farm Aid crisis line\n\nThe stress farmers have endured in trying to keep everything together has been overwhelming, especially on farms passed down for generations. Nobody wants to be the one to close the gates.\n\n\"It feels like you've failed,\" said Schoessow, the UW-Extension agent.\n\nJoe Schroeder answers the crisis line for Farm Aid, a group launched during the farm crisis of the mid-1980s and known for its annual concerts organized by Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, Neil Young and Dave Matthews.\n\nSchroeder has talked with farmers in the darkest periods of their lives. He\u2019s kept some from committing suicide; he\u2019s convinced others to get guns out of their house to avoid rash decisions.\n\nThese days, from his base in Cambridge, Mass., he's getting more calls from Wisconsin dairy farmers whose lives have gone off the rails.\n\n\"They\u2019re often the farmers who have the fewest options, the toughest ones to help,\" Schroeder said.\n\nJeff Ditzenberger has been in their shoes. One summer night he walked into an abandoned house near his farm in Green County, lit a fire, and waited to die.\n\nFollowing months of mental health issues, and unable to get help from a rural health system lacking resources, he planned his own death that August evening in 1992.\n\n\u201cTake the worst day, the worst feeling you\u2019ve ever had \u2026 multiply that by a hundred. Add 10. Then you kind of get it,\u201d he said.\n\nJeff Ditzenberger has become a lifeline for other farmers who've contemplated suicide. Mark Hoffman/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nThe flames crept up the walls, and the house filled with smoke.\n\n\u201cYou get a sense of morbid peace,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s like you won\u2019t be a burden or a disappointment to anybody anymore.\u201d\n\nAt the last moment he changed his mind and hurried out of the burning building.\n\n\"Thankfully, I failed miserably\" at suicide, he said.\n\nHe's since started a mental health support group for men, and he's spoken with many farmers struggling with stress, depression and thoughts of ending their lives.\n\n\"I have caught more of my friends in the middle of their suicide plots than I care to mention,\" Ditzenberger said. \u201cSuicide doesn\u2019t give a sh-- what your occupation is. It\u2019s just wicked.\"\n\nAgency looks for ways to help farmers\n\nThe Wisconsin Farm Center, part of the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, has been getting about 200 calls a month on its toll-free crisis line.\n\nThe Farm Center offers farmers a wide range of free services including mediation with creditors. It also offers vouchers that farmers and their families can use to get counseling.\n\nThe staff has decades of experience in agriculture.\n\n\"They understand what people are going through, and they\u2019re really good listeners,\u201d said Farm Center Director Kathy Schmitt.\n\nThe agency looks for ways to keep farms in business or find an exit strategy.\n\n\u201cWe will come right to your kitchen table, or if you want to meet at a McDonald\u2019s we will do that too. It's whatever you feel comfortable with,\" Schmitt said. \u201cSome creditors will accept reduced amounts. And even if we can\u2019t come to an agreement, being able to talk it through with them is good for the relationship.\"\n\nFederal court data shows that western Wisconsin had the highest number of Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies in the nation in 2017. And that's only a glimpse into the dairy crisis since Chapter 12 is a relatively rare tool used in farm closures.\n\nIt allows farmers to \u201ccram down\u201d secured debt such as land mortgages to a more affordable level.\n\n\u201cBut one of the big problems is that it cannot be used by farmers whose debt exceeds $4,153,150. That sounds like a big number, but in the dairy farming world where equipment, machinery, feed and operating expenses are very high, it is not,\u201d said Elizabeth Rich, an attorney from Plymouth and president of the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund Foundation.\n\n\u201cFifth- and sixth-generation dairy farmers are losing their farms; many are killing themselves. We can and must do better,\u201d she said.\n\nFirst stress, then stroke\n\nThe Spauldings were one of those families who turned to the Wisconsin Farm Center in January.\n\nThe question was whether time was too short, and the problems too severe.\n\nIn October 2017, Chuck had a stroke.\n\nHe was out raking hay, then put the tractor away and headed into the house for a glass of water. His hands were numb that day, but he figured it was from the vibrations of steering the tractor.\n\nThen he dropped the glass. He was on the kitchen floor trying to clean up the mess, \"talking mumbo jumbo,\" as Sue recalls.\n\nShe called her son-in-law to come over right away.\n\n\"We drove so fast to the hospital we had the cops chasing us,\" Sue said.\n\nChuck was flown to Eau Claire for treatment. The stroke left him paralyzed. He couldn't talk, and for a while he couldn't remember his wife's name.\n\nThen, back home for a day, he had a brain hemorrhage.\n\nAnother emergency medical flight, this time to a hospital in Marshfield.\n\nNow, after about a year of physical therapy, he\u2019s able to work on the farm again but not like before. His right side is weak; he can manage driving a tractor but not a car.\n\nStill, \"he is a true miracle,\" Sue said.\n\nChuck remains hopeful that milk prices will turn around, Sue said, like they did after previous slumps that lasted a year or two. But this one is much worse in that it's dragged on for such a long time.\n\n\"It's almost like there's hope, but then there isn't,\" Sue said.\n\nAdding another layer of stress, the Spauldings briefly lost their milk buyer \u2014 a blow that could have spelled the end of their dairy operation.\n\nShe and Chuck sought a loan from their local bank to keep the farm afloat until money starts coming in from the new milk buyer.\n\n\u201cI am scared. If we lose the farm, we lose our home, too,\u201d Sue said. \"We just remain in survival mode.\"\n\nSue Spaulding is shown with a 3-week-old calf, Hope, which had some health issues. It died a few days later. Mark Hoffman / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nDairy farms are too productive\n\nThough dairy farms of every size are struggling, some remain profitable if their operating costs are low enough to handle fallen milk prices or they have enough income from other sources.\n\nVery large dairy farms, which can have anywhere from 1,000 to 8,000 cows or more, benefit from economies of scale \u2014 meaning they can negotiate lower prices for necessities such as animal feed and are better financed to weather a downturn.\n\n\"The big dairies almost seem to be in perennial expansion mode,\" said Hans Breitenmoser Jr., who has a 430-cow farm in Lincoln County.\n\n\"There are farms pumping out a ferocious amount of milk, whereas a generation ago if farms fell by the wayside, production also went down,\" he said.\n\nThe current slump, now in its fifth year, has lasted long enough that farmers are questioning whether it's become the new normal in dairy.\n\n\"I will be perfectly honest, I am scared about that,\" Breitenmoser said.\n\nDairy farms are so productive these days, partly from improved cow genetics, they can quickly flood markets.\n\n\"We are very good at what we do,\" Breitenmoser said.\n\nFurther, farmers who have invested heavily in their milking operation can\u2019t afford to just turn off the spigot. Instead, as profit margins shrink, they try to squeeze out ever-higher amounts of milk to cover their costs \u2014 even if it adds to the overall surplus.\n\nSome farmers say the U.S. needs a milk supply management system, like Canada has, that imposes production quotas and protects farmers' income.\n\nCritics of Canada's system say it has resulted in trade barriers to U.S. dairy products.\n\n\"But whether the answer is a system similar to Canada's supply management program or something completely different, we can't just sit back and continue down the same current path without trying to find something that actually works for farmers,\" Brad Rach, dairy director for the National Farmers Organization, wrote in a blog.\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nEven quitting can be challenging.\n\nTwenty years ago, a farmer could hold a farm closure auction and other farmers in the area would come and buy almost everything. There aren't as many buyers now, said Jim Goodman, a former organic dairy farmer from Wonewoc and president of the group Family Farm Defenders.\n\nBanks have applied more pressure, and not just in Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cThree young farmers in foreclosure that I know of and herds being liquidated,\u201d a country lawyer in New York state said in a recent email to Goodman.\n\n\u201cYoung, unseasoned people in shell shock. Feed companies suing farmers for past-due feed bills. \u2026 There is a crying need for emergency help right now to get through the winter or there is going to be another round of sell-offs.\"\n\nLast fall, Goodman called it quits after more than 40 years of milking cows on his third-generation family farm. He sold off his 45-cow herd, whose lineage could be traced back more than a century.\n\n\"If there was light at the end of the tunnel, and you could say things would be looking up by the summer, that would be one thing. But nobody has an idea that's going to happen,\" he said.\n\nOne positive note in the recent farm bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump is an improved income insurance plan \u2014 partially funded by the government and from premiums paid by farmers \u2014 to help when the gap between milk prices and cattle feed prices widens to a certain point.\n\nStill, it's no substitute for a strong marketplace.\n\n\"The farmers I know would rather receive fair prices for their products at the farm gate than having to live with the stress of volatile markets and the unknowns of whether emergency relief and insurance will kick in,\" said O'Connor with the Wisconsin Farmers Union.\n\nEven if milk prices improve this year, it could be too little, too late, for many farmers who have \"simply run out of financial and emotional strength to continue,\" said Peter Hardin, publisher of The Milkweed, a dairy industry publication in Brooklyn, Wisconsin.\n\n\"You can tell people that things are going to get better, but until they see it in their milk checks they won't \u2014 and shouldn't \u2014 believe it,\" Hardin said. \"The only comparable example now is the Great Depression.\"\n\nSpaulding family runs S & S Dairy in Shell Lake Sue and Chuck Spaulding have partnered with their daughter and her husband to run the farm, S & S Dairy, in Shell Lake. Mark Hoffman, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nTrying to hang on\n\nThe Spauldings say they\u2019ll hang on for as long as they possibly can.\n\n\"Chuck has worked his whole life for this place,\" Sue said, and he wants to give it another year before deciding whether to sell the cows.\n\nThey raised seven children on the farm, through a blended family from previous marriages, and they've been through some lean years.\n\n\"But we were always able to put food on the table, have clothes for the kids, and live a good life,\u201d Sue said. \u201cNow, I'm glad we don't have little kids.\u201d\n\nThe Spauldings' youngest daughter and son-in-law, Christy and Jeremy Spexet, also rely on the farm for their livelihood. They live in a mobile home nearby and put in long hours to keep the milking operation going.\n\n\"We are lucky to have them,\" Sue said.\n\nBut Chuck and Sue cannot afford to pay them much. In a nod to both desperation and technology, Sue started a GoFundMe campaign to get some help from the public. Other farmers have done the same.\n\n\"We set a $30,000 goal for our campaign because we didn't want to scare people away,\u201d Sue said. \u201cBut we probably owe about a quarter of a million dollars.\"\n\n\"I feel bad for reaching out because I know there are a lot of other people worse off. But at this point even a $10 donation feels like $100,\" she said.\n\nShe and Chuck would like the farm to be their legacy, a place for their family to carry on traditions. A lot of other farmers wanted that too, but it wasn't meant to be.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking,\" Sue said.\n\nChuck Spaulding moves his 1964 John Deere tractor into a shed while doing chores on their farm in Shell Lake. Mark Hoffman/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nAnger at a broken system\n\nDanielle Endvick, from Chippewa County, said her dream of becoming a dairy farmer died when her father\u2019s farm shut down.\n\n\u201cFrom the time I was a young girl, trailing dad out to the barn to feed calves, I remember boldly declaring my plans for my future: \u2018I\u2019m going to be a farmer, too,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy world revolved around our dairy farm. I woke early to help dad with morning chores and headed straight back to the barn when the school bus dropped me off after school. Some of my best memories were those chore times spent with dad, ambling along beneath the whitewashed barn beams.\"\n\nShe also remembers the farm slipping away from her father as, month after month, the milk checks kept getting smaller.\n\n\u201cAnother price drop \u2026 Dad had become a regular at our small-town bank. He was a sound farm manager and worked full time at the local feed mill for the insurance and extra paycheck. But with milk prices on an ever dipping-and-diving roller coaster, our chances of digging out looked slim,\u201d she said.\n\nA few years after she left the farm, her father sold the herd. As she saw dairy farms falling apart in the current crisis, she wrote a remembrance of that time not long ago.\n\n\u201cI remember the dreary day spent following the cattle broker as he walked through the barn, eyeing up the cows I\u2019d raised from calves, as he turned over in his mind which would bring the prettiest penny. And I remember all too well that emotional last milking, where dad and I again found ourselves gathered around the bulk tank, this time with my infant son, Blake, who slept peacefully in a corner of the milk house.\"\n\n\u201cWhen the cattle trailer backed up beside the milk house, our big Brown Swiss, Brownie, was among the first to load. I paused to scratch her head one last time before nudging her across the gutter and out the door. One by one the cows filed out, closing a chapter on the farm.\u201d\n\nLater, Endvick relived the pain as she watched her uncle's cows head out the door of his barn one last time.\n\n\"Two farms erased from Wisconsin's dairy industry,\" she said. \"Two among thousands lost these past few years.\"\n\nIn 2015, Endvick realized her dream of having her own farm, now named Runamuck Ranch, where she and her husband, Jesse, raise beef cattle, goats and chickens.\n\nBut they're not milking cows.\n\n\"Some days I'm thankful for the foresight dad had. A lifetime in the dairy industry told him that we were on a runaway train that was only headed for heartache,\" Endvick said.\n\n\"Other days I'm angry that I didn't try to fight it out and do what I love, no matter how hard the struggle. But ... as I see fear stirring in my friends who are dairy farming, I'm angry at a system that has been broken for so many years.\"\n\nAndrew Mollica of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/21/trump-tweets-he-wants-new-5-g-and-6-g-networks-u-s-asap/2937110002/", "text": "CLOSE Cellular technology is about to make an evolutionary leap. 5G is almost here.

We must always be the leader in everything we do, especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019\n\nIt is unclear what prompted the President to tweet about the new wireless network race.\n\nCarriers around the world, notably in South Korea and China, are racing to deploy 5G across their mobile networks though as with the U.S. many of the wide rollouts won't begin until later this year or in 2020. The new technology promises improved speeds and lower latency, laying the groundwork for other technologies such as self-driving cars.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a USA TODAY request for additional comment.\n\nIn a statement the CTIA, the trade association representing the U.S. wireless communications industry, appreciated the support from the President.\n\n\u201cWe share the President\u2019s commitment to leading the world in next-generation 5G wireless. Thanks to the innovation, hard work and investment of America\u2019s wireless industry, the first commercial 5G deployments are happening now, in communities across the country.\"\n\n\"With the Administration's continued backing, the U.S. wireless industry can bring more robust 5G networks to more communities faster.\u201d\n\nThe current 5G race\n\nFrom (l-r): Samsung Galaxy S10 5G , Galaxy S10+, Samsung Galaxy S10, and Galaxy S10E.

(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\n\nIn the U.S., AT&T has already launched its mobile 5G network in 12 cities late last year, with Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile all rushing to launch their own mobile 5G services this year.\n\nVerizon on Wednesday announced that it will be the first to launch the Galaxy S10 5G in the U.S., though other carriers will get it later.\n\nMore: Galaxy S10: Samsung celebrates line's 10th anniversary with four new models, including 5G\n\nAT&T has even, controversially, relabeled its updated 4G LTE network as \"5G E\" or \"5G Evolution\" in a bid to convince customers that it has a wider 5G network than it actually does. The company has gone so far as to update Android icons to display a 5GE logo and advertise that it has \"5G E\" in television spots.\n\nThe move has drawn the ire of rival carriers and technology followers, with Sprint suing AT&T earlier this month claiming the ad was \"false advertising.\"\n\nOn a separate note, Sprint and T-Mobile are currently in the process of trying to complete their own $26-billion merger, claiming that they need to partner in order to deploy 5G nationwide.\n\nGiven the concerns about the U.S. carrier market shrinking from four to three in this deal, it is unclear how Trump's latest tweet might impact the case the two companies are making to get their merger approved by lawmakers.\n\nWhile companies are moving quickly, rolling out new networks takes time and nationwide 5G deployments could take a few years. The 6G, Trump tweeted about doesn't yet exist beyond the theoretical and likely won't come into focus for several years.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/21/trump-tweets-he-wants-new-5-g-and-6-g-networks-u-s-asap/2937110002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/21/burger-king-adds-new-flamed-grill-chicken-sandwich-menu/2929895002/", "text": "CLOSE America's fastest drive-thru chain of 2018 will not only shock you, but probably cause a fight among friends.

The increase in life expectancy at birth, as well as the likelihood of living a long life, vary considerably across the United States.\n\nTo identify the states where people are expected to live the longest, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed life expectancy at birth figures for 2010-2015 obtained from the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF).\n\nLife expectancy in some states increased by just three years since 1980, and by as much as nine years in others. These variations are closely related to differences in a host of factors. For example, long-standing research has found that Americans with lower socioeconomic status tend to have lower life expectancies than more affluent Americans.\n\nPharmacists, lawyers, CEOs: A look at the highest paying jobs for women\n\nWhat size home can you afford?: A look at how much house you can buy for $200,000 in each state\n\nMississippi (Photo: Damian Entwistle from Nelson, Lancashire, England / Wikimedia Commons)\n\n50. Mississippi\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 74.7 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 71.6 years (2nd lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 3.1 years (5th smallest)\n\nLife expectancy at birth in Mississippi is the lowest of all states and has historically been low. As is generally the case in states with low life expectancy, Mississippi struggles with poverty, and residents report relatively unhealthy behaviors. At 19.8 percent, no state has a higher poverty rate. Mississippi also has the largest share of adults who do not exercise, at more than a third of the local adult population.\n\n49. West Virginia\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 75.3 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.8 years (10th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 2.5 years (2nd smallest)\n\nLike every other state, life expectancy in West Virginia has improved in recent decades. Even though a baby born in West Virginia is expected to live longer than a newborn in 1980, the 2.5 year increase was the second smallest. The state's life expectancy rank dropped from 10th lowest in 1980 to second lowest of all states in 2015.\n\nObesity and smoking may be contributing factors. Mortality among smokers in the United States is three times higher than among people who have never smoked, and West Virginia has the highest adult smoking rate, at 24.8 percent. The state's adult obesity rate of 35.5 percent is also the highest of all states.\n\n48. Alabama\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 75.4 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.3 years (5th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 3.1 years (6th smallest)\n\nSimilar to other states with the shortest life expectancies, Alabama struggles with poverty, and residents report relatively unhealthy behaviors, such as adult obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

A 2014 study found individuals in the lowest income quartile had more healthful behaviors and lived longer in areas with more college graduates. The share of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher in the Cotton State is low, at 25.5 percent.\n\n47. Louisiana\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 75.6 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 71.6 years (the lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.0 years (15th smallest)\n\nPoverty and poor health are closely related. Having little money increases the chance of poor health because of poorer access to health care and to healthy food and lifestyle choices. Further, the cost of going to the doctor as well as the possible treatment that may follow can be devastating financially.\n\nLouisiana is the state with the second largest share of the population living below the poverty line. Relatively high numbers of households in the state live on incomes considerably lower than the poverty threshold. The Creole State has the highest number of households living with less than $10,000 a year.\n\n46. Oklahoma\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 75.7 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.6 years (23rd lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 2.1 years (the smallest)\n\nLife expectancy at birth in Oklahoma has increased since 1980 by just over two years, the smallest increase among all 50 states. In 1980, Oklahoma was ranked 23rd in life expectancy. By 2015, its rank had dropped to 46th.\n\nIn addition to excessive drinking, obesity, and lack of physical activity -- the Sooner State ranks high in all three -- Oklahoma has the second highest share of the population without health insurance, at 14.2 percent. Research has shown that uninsured adults have worse access to care, receive poorer quality of care, and experience worse health outcomes than insured adults.\n\nKentucky (Photo: Jacqueline Nix / Getty Images)\n\n45. Kentucky\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 75.8 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.9 years (13th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 2.9 years (4th smallest)\n\nEven though only 5.4 percent of Kentucky's population does not have health insurance, many residents engage in unhealthy behaviors -- the state has the the sixth largest share of adults who are obese and the second largest share of adults who smoke.\n\nIn addition, there are just over 66 primary care doctors available for every 100,000 residents of the Bluegrass State, the ninth lowest ratio in the country. Lack of primary care has been linked to poor health. Kentucky has the highest share of Medicare enrollees who would not have had to be hospitalized had they seen a doctor, at 76 per 1,000 people.\n\n44. Arkansas\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 75.8 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.9 years (14th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 2.9 years (3rd smallest)\n\nLife expectancy in Arkansas is longer compared to 1980 but only by 2.9 years, the third smallest increase in the United States over that time period. Lack of physical activity, which is a major cause of chronic diseases, may partially explain the relatively small improvement.\n\nThe state has the second lowest share of adult residents who exercise regularly, at just over 32 percent, and the fifth lowest share of the local population with access to places for physical activity. Adult residents report feeling unhealthy an average of five days a month, the second most in the country.\n\n43. Tennessee\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 76.1 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.8 years (12th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 3.3 years (7th smallest)\n\nAs is frequently the case in states with relatively low life expectancies, Tennessee has among the highest poverty, obesity, and smoking rates. The average number of both mentally and physically unhealthy days per month reported by state residents are also some of the highest compared with other states. .\n\nLack of access to high quality medical care is also a major factor in life expectancy. Tennessee is one of several states that have not expanded Medicaid to single, low-income adults between 19 and 64 years of age.\n\n42. South Carolina\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 76.8 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 71.8 years (3rd lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.0 years (19th largest)\n\nThe average newborn in South Carolina is expected to live 76.8 years, versus the national average life expectancy at birth of 78.6 years.\n\nNo other state has fewer people with access to a gym or other place where they can exercise, at only 54.2 percent of the state's adult population. Staying physically active is a key component of a healthy lifestyle. Regular exercise can help prevent obesity, which is associated with a host of adverse health outcomes. South Carolina's obesity rate of 32.0 percent is the 10th highest of all states.\n\n41. Indiana\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 77.2 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.6 years (24th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 3.8 years (9th smallest)\n\nWhile life expectancies have risen in all states over recent decades, life expectancy has declined in some states since 2014. Indiana's life expectancy at birth in 2014 was 77.7 years; it is now 77.2 years. As is the case in many states, the decline in life expectancy is mostly due to rise in suicides and fatal drug overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOther unhealthy behaviors may also help explain Indiana's relatively low life expectancy at birth. The state's adult smoking rate, for example, at 21.1 percent, is the 10th highest of all states.\n\n40. Georgia\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 77.4 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.0 years (4th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.4 years (13th largest)\n\nGeorgia residents have improved their lifestyle since 1980. The result has been the 13th largest increase in the state's average life expectancy at birth. The state moved from having the fourth lowest life expectancy to 11th lowest of all states.\n\nWhat is still holding Georgia back is its high poverty rate of 14.90 percent as well as the large share of residents who do not have health insurance of 13.40 percent -- the fourth highest in the country. Working people with no health coverage have 40 percent higher mortality risk than those who have private insurance, according to research published in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\n39. Missouri\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 77.4 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.4 years (21st lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.01 years (16th smallest)\n\nMissouri's life expectancy at birth had improved compared to 1980, but their life expectancy rank has dropped over the same period from 21st to 11th lowest. Similar to other states where life expectancy has not improved much compared to other states, Missouri has a high share of residents with no health coverage and a high share of preventable hospitalizations.\n\nOther contributing factors are likely the 22.15 percent adult smoking rate, the seventh highest in the country; the 25.80 percent share of adults who do not exercise, the 11th highest; and the 31.80 percent adult obesity rate, the 12th highest.\n\nOhio (Photo: Sean Pavone / Getty Images)\n\n38. Ohio\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 77.5 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.3 years (19th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.2 years (18th smallest)\n\nOhio, the seventh most populous state in the country, has the sixth highest unemployment rate at 5.00 percent. The national jobless rate is 4.40 percent. People who do not have an income face many health challenges, including being more likely to develop a stress-related conditions, such as stroke, heart attack, heart disease, or arthritis. High unemployment in a single year will likely do little to affect the longevity of residents, but sustained joblessness could have an impact on life expectancy.\n\nGeorgians report feeling mentally unhealthy for 4.3 days a month, higher than the national average of of 3.8 mentally unhealthy days a month.\n\n37. New Mexico\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 77.8 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.0 years (24th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 3.76 years (11th smallest)\n\nNew Mexico's life expectancy rank compared to other states has significantly worsened since 1980, dropping 13 spots from 24th highest to 14th lowest. Lowering poverty can improve health outcomes. No state has a larger share of households living on less than $10,000 a year or using food stamps. New Mexico's poverty rate of 19.70 percent is the second highest poverty rate in the country and compares to a national poverty rate of 13.40 percent.\n\nJust 72.77 percent of diabetics in the Land of Enchantment test their blood sugar on regular basis, the lowest share and compares to national share of 85.00 percent. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been linked to shorter life spans of about 11 and five years, respectively.\n\n36. North Carolina\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 77.9 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.8 years (10th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.11 years (18th largest)\n\nNorth Carolina's relatively high poverty rate, uninsured rate, and share of households with an annual income of less than $10,000 are likely contributing to the state's relatively low life expectancy at birth.\n\nThe life expectancy of residents varies with where in the state they live, according to research by NC Child, a nonprofit. People who are born today in Watauga County, which is not far from the northern border with Virginia, have a life expectancy of 82 years, compared to people born in Swain County, which is about 140 miles south, and who are expected to live 73 years.\n\n35. Michigan\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 78.0 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.4 years (20th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.6 years (24th smallest)\n\nThe differences in states life expectancy at birth are closely related to differences in socioeconomic and and health-related behaviors and outcomes, such as home values, the share of college educated adults, and smoking rate. In Michigan, the typical home value of $155,700 is well below the national median of $217,600. The percentage of Michigan adults with at least a bachelor's degree of 29.1 percent, while high compared to other states with relatively short life expectancies, is below the national percentage of 32.0 percent. Approximately one in every five adults in the state smoke, among the highest proportions of all states.\n\n34. Nevada\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 78.1 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.7 years (7th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.4 years (12th largest)\n\nNevada has one of the highest uninsured rates as well as one of the highest share of adults with no access to places for physical activity. The Sagebrush State also has among the lowest shares adult with a bachelor's degree or higher.\n\nEducation contributes to more active communication, which, research has found to be crucial in health care. Better-educated people tend to ask more questions, have better ability to interpret medication labels, and are more likely to take medication properly.\n\n33. Alaska\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 78.1 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.5 years (6th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.6 years (11th largest)\n\nThe increase in life expectancy at birth in Alaska since 1980 is among the highest in the country. Life expectancy has improved significantly especially in remote areas in Alaska due to better access to quality medical care and decreasing the rate of premature deaths.\n\nAlaska has the third highest share of residents without health insurance. It also has the seventh highest share of preventable hospitalizations at 36.05 per 1,000 people.\n\n32. Wyoming\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 78.4 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.2 years (22nd highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.2 years (19th smallest)\n\nThe least populous state in the country has the sixth highest percentage of residents who do not have health insurance coverage and the fifth highest injury mortality rate per 100,000 people, at 90.1, compared to a national average of 65.0. Wyoming is among the states with the lowest share of diabetics who check their blood pressure on a regular basis. For insulin-taking diabetics, self-monitoring blood sugar levels has been recognized as crucial for self-care because it can help keep glucose levels within an acceptable range.\n\n31. Texas\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 78.5 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.6 years (25th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.9 years (23rd largest)\n\nThe second most populous state in the country has the highest share of the population with no health insurance, at 17.3 percent, compared to a national share of 8.7 percent. About 4.5 million Texas residents are uninsured, some 700,000 of them children. Lack of coverage has been linked to serious health problems such as such as higher prevalence of illnesses and injuries, chronic diseases, and higher mortality.\n\nPennsylvania (Photo: Jnovack7 / Getty Images)\n\n30. Pennsylvania\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 78.5 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.2 years (16th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.3 years (16th largest)\n\nAbout a fifth of adults do not engage in physical activity, which is about the national average. Lack of exercises has been consistently linked to poor physical health, which, research has found, is also associated with poor mental health. The number of both mentally and physically unhealthy days a month adults in the state reported of 4.3 and 3.9, respectively, is higher than the national average of 3.8 and 3.7, respectively.\n\n29. Kansas\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 78.5 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 75.1 years (10th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 3.4 years (8th smallest)\n\nKansas' life expectancy at birth rank relative to other states has declined significantly since 1980, from 10th highest to 22nd lowest. What seems to be driving this change is the high obesity rate in the state. Some 32.4 percent of adults are obese, the eighth highest obesity rate of all states and higher than the national rate of 28.0 percent.\n\n28. Delaware\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 78.6 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.8 years (11th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.8 years (8th largest)\n\nDelaware is one of the 10 states with the largest share of households with an annual income of less than $10,000, adults who do not exercise, and driving deaths involving alcohol. The First State has a shortage of dentists. There are 49.1 dentists per 100,000 people, the third lowest concentration in the United States. Dentists can check for unhealthy teeth and gum disease, which some research suggests can even be an indication of heart problems. The concentration of primary care doctors is also below the nationwide average. There are 72.1 primary care doctors per 100,000 state residents, compared to 75.8 per 100,000 nationwide.\n\n27. Montana\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 78.9 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.3 years (21st highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.7 years (25th smallest)\n\nNearly half of of driving deaths in Montana involve alcohol, the second highest share of all states and well above the national share of 29.0 percent. The state also has the fourth highest injury mortality rate, at 91.3 per 100,000 people, compared to 65.0 per 100,000 nationwide. The premature age-adjusted mortality rate in Montana of 345.4 premature deaths per 100,000 people is also significantly higher than the national rate of 336.4 deaths under age 75 premature deaths per 100,000 people.\n\n26. Maine\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.0 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.5 years (19th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.5 years (22nd smallest)\n\nLife expectancy in Maine has dropped from 79.3 years in 2014 to 79.0 years just a year later. Reducing drunk driving deaths may increase life expectancy as the state has the third highest percentage of driving deaths with alcohol involvement. In addition, a third of adult residents are obese, about the same as national obesity rate. And 20.5 percent of adults report excessive drinking, also above the 18.8 percent share nationwide.\n\n25. South Dakota\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.1 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.9 years (13th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.2 years (20th smallest)\n\nSouth Dakota's life expectancy at birth rank compared to other states has significantly declined, from having the 13th highest life expectancy in 1980 to 23rd highest just 35 years later. Adults report the fewest mentally unhealthy days a month and among the fewest physically unhealthy days a month. The state also has the lowest share of adults who report being in poor health. What may be driving South Dakota's life expectancy ranking lower, however, is the share of excessive drinking and the percentage of driving deaths involving alcohol. Some 20.2 percent of adults report excessive drinking compared to 18.0 percent nationwide, and 37.2 percent of driving deaths involve alcohol, the sixth highest share in the country.\n\n24. Idaho\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.1 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 75.2 years (7th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 3.89 years (13th smallest)\n\nIdaho is another state where the life expectancy rank has dropped significantly since 1980, from the seventh highest to 24th highest. While the share of adults smoking, drinking excessively, and those who are obese is close to national averages, the share of state residents who lack health insurance coverage is higher than the national share. More than 10.1 percent of residents are uninsured compared to 8.7 percent of Americans nationwide.\n\n23. Illinois\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.1 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.3 years (18th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.9 years (7th largest)\n\nIllinois has improved its life expectancy standing over the last four decades due to a near 5.9 years increase in life expectancy -- the seventh largest improvement in the country. The Prairie State has higher than average concentrations of primary care doctors and dentists per 100,000 residents, and a lower than the national average adult smoking rate. However, the share of adults drinking excessively is high (21.1 percent), as is the share of preventable hospitalizations (54.8 per 100,000 people) compared to the national figures of 18.0 percent and 49.0, respectively.\n\n22. Virginia\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.2 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.1 years (15th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 6.1 years (5th largest)\n\nCompared to 1980, life expectancy at birth has risen in all states. The improvement in Virginia has been especially large. A typical Virginia newborn in 1980 was expected to live 73.1 years, the 15th lowest expectancy of states at that time. Today, the state's life expectancy at birth of 79.2 years is in the higher half of states.\n\nVirginia's relatively long life expectancy at birth, while still lower than 21 states, is likely partly the result of high college attainment and high incomes, both factors shown to improve health and life expectancy in populations. Of adults in the state, 38.7 percent have at least a bachelor's degree, the fifth largest percentage of all states. The typical household in the state has an annual income of $71, 535, the ninth highest income in the nation.\n\n21. Maryland\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.2 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 72.8 years (8th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 6.45 years (4th largest)\n\nExposure to air pollution, lack of access to healthy food, lack of access to high quality (expensive) medical care, and a host of other health risk factors are more common in poorer areas. All of these are are associated with low life expectancy, and states with low incomes tend to have higher life expectancies. Maryland has the highest median household income of any state, at $80,776.\n\nLife expectancy in Maryland has improved notably in recent decades. A typical Maryland newborn in 1980 was expected to live 72.8 years, in the bottom 10 of states at that time.\n\nNebraska (Photo: 41294655@N00 / Flickr)\n\n20. Nebraska\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.4 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 75.4 years (6th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.1 years (17th smallest)\n\nNebraska's life expectancy at birth ranking over the last four decades has dropped significantly, from sixth highest in 1980 to 20th highest in 2015. Some 21.1 percent of state adult residents report excessive drinking, the fifth highest share of all states and higher than the national share. Similarly, the state's adult obesity rate is higher than the national share. These factors might be contributing to the state's decline in ranking.\n\n19. Arizona\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.5 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.1 years (23rd highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.4 years (14th largest)\n\nUnlike most states with higher-than-average life expectancy at birth, the poverty rate and uninsured rate in Arizona are relatively high. Nearly 15 percent of Arizonans live in poverty, and more than 10 percent do not have health insurance, each the 11th highest percentage of all states.\n\n18. Oregon\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.5 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.8 years (15th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.8 years (25th largest)\n\nJust as lack of access to medical care can adversely affect life expectancy, a strong health system can help explain a relatively high life expectancy. For every 100,000 Oregon residents, there are 95 primary care physicians, 81 dentists, and 454 mental health providers -- all in the top 10 compared to all states.\n\n17. Wisconsin\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.5 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 75.2 years (9th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.3 years (21st smallest)\n\nAt 26.1 percent, no other state has a higher share of adults who drink excessively than Wisconsin. Defined as having at least five drinks during one occasion for men and four for women, excessive drinking has been linked to higher risk of heart disease, cancer, and mental health problems, all of which can lead to premature death. The state's adult obesity rate of 30.6 percent is higher than the national rate of 28.0 percent.\n\n16. Iowa\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.5 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 75.7 years (5th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 3.8 years (12th smallest)\n\nIowa had one of the smallest life expectancies improvement between 1980 and 2015, and as a result, its ranking dropped, from fifth highest in 1980 to 16th highest in 2015. The Hawkeye State would likely benefit from a lower adult obesity rate as well as having adults exercise more and drink less. All three measures compare poorly relative to all states.\n\n15. Florida\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.6 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.0 years (25th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.6 years (10th largest)\n\nA person born in Florida in 2015 is expected to live 79.6 years, a full year longer than the average American newborn that year and the 15th highest life expectancy of all states. The state has also had one of the larger improvements in life expectancy, increasing by 5.6 years since 1980.\n\nWhile socioeconomic factors like health insurance coverage rates and median household income frequently help explain differences in life expectancy, this is not always the case. In Florida, 12.9 percent of people are uninsured, unusually high for a state with a relatively long life expectancy at birth. Florida's median annual household income of $52,594 is also exceptionally low for the state's position in this ranking. The state's low income is likely high due to the high share of retirees residing in the state.\n\n14. Rhode Island\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.6 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.7 years (17th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.9 years (22nd largest)\n\nThe smallest state by area has the fourth largest concentration of primary care doctors and the sixth largest concentration of mental health providers per 100,000 people. The state's adult smoking and obesity rates are slightly below the national rates of 28.0 percent and 18.0 percent, respectively.\n\n13. Utah\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.6 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 75.9 years (3rd highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 3.7 years (10th smallest)\n\nDespite declining in ranking for life expectancy of states since 1980, Utah has remained among the states with a higher life expectancy. Utah has a relatively low adult obesity and physical inactivity rates -- with a number of national parks and monuments in the state it is hard to stay inside. These factors may explain why Utah is still in the top 15. What could be contributing to its decline in ranking however, is the state's fairly large share of uninsured people, which at 9.2 percent is the 15th highest of all states. People with no health insurance coverage have worse access to health care due to high cost and are less likely to receive care.\n\n12. North Dakota\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.8 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 75.8 years (4th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.0 years (14th smallest)\n\nDespite still ranking among the 15 states with the highest life expectancy, South Dakota used to rank even higher. Several factors might be contributing to the Peace Garden State's drop in ranking. Some 31.8 percent of state adults are obese, higher than the 28.0 percent nationwide, and the state has the second highest share of adults who report excessive drinking. Further, 48.1 percent of car accident deaths in the state involve alcohol, the highest share of all states.\n\nVermont (Photo: Sean Pavone / Getty Images)\n\n11. Vermont\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.9 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.5 years (18th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.4 years (14th largest)\n\nGood access to health services across a population often translates to better health outcomes because of the better odds of treating chronic health issues and of catching serious health problems early. No state has more primary care physicians per capita than Vermont, where for every 100,000 people there are 112.4 doctors serving communities. The concentration of mental health providers, at 407.2 per 100,000, is fourth highest of all states.\n\nVermont's life expectancy at birth in 1980 was higher than most other states. Since then it has improved faster than most states, rising by 5.4 years.\n\n10. New Hampshire\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 79.9 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.9 years (12th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.0 years (21st largest)\n\nLife expectancy in New Hampshire has continued to be among the highest over the years. Two reasons may help explain the consistent relatively high expectancy: relatively high educational attainment and low poverty, both of which have been linked to better overall health and longer life expectancy. No other state has a lower poverty rate, and only one has a lower share of households with an annual income of $10,000 or less. The Granite State has the eighth highest share of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher.\n\n9. Washington\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 80.2 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 75.1 years (10th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.1 years (17th largest)\n\nWashington state has had among the longer life expectancies of all states over the last four decades. One possible reason may be the high share of the population who engage in physical activity. Only 17.1 percent do not exercise, the third lowest percentage, compared to 23.0 percent nationwide. The Evergreen State is also among those with the highest concentration of primary care doctors, dentists, and health care providers per 100,000 residents.\n\n8. Colorado\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 80.2 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 75.2 years (8th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.0 years (19th largest)\n\nColorado's average life expectancy at birth has remained eighth highest since 1980. The Centennial State has the lowest adult obesity rate in the country. In terms of overall health measures, Colorado has among the lowest shares of obesity, cancer deaths, and children living in poverty.\n\n7. New Jersey\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 80.2 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.5 years (22nd lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 6.7 years (2nd largest)\n\nNew Jersey's life expectancy at birth has significantly improved over the last four decades, more so than other states. As a result, its ranking improved from having the 22nd lowest life expectancy in 1980 to seventh highest in 2015. The Garden States has among the highest education attainment rates and household incomes of all states, and among the lowest poverty rates. These factors may have contributed to the state's 6.7 year increase in life expectancy, the second largest of all states.\n\nMassachusetts (Photo: grantreig / Getty Images)\n\n6. Massachusetts\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 80.4 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.7 years (16th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 5.7 years (9th largest)\n\nMassachusetts has significantly improved its standing when it comes to life expectancy, jumping 10 spots since 1980. One factor that may help explain this jump is health insurance coverage. No state has a lower share of uninsured residents. Other contributing factors may be the state's fourth lowest adult obesity rate. In addition, the Bay State has the highest concentration of mental health providers and dentists per capita, and the third highest concentration of primary care physicians.\n\n5. New York\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 80.5 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 73.2 years (17th lowest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 7.3 years (the largest)\n\nAs is often the case in states with high life expectancies, measures such as New York's relatively low obesity rate and high college attainment rate reflect healthy lifestyles and advantages that support longer lives. One in four state adults are obese, versus approximately one in three adults nationwide. The percentage of adults with at least a bachelor's degree of 36 percent is 10th highest of all states.\n\nNew York's life expectancy at birth rose by over seven years between 1980 and 2015, the largest improvement in the nation. To the extent that economic status relates to life expectancy, however, the gains in life expectancy are not enjoyed equally across the state. New York is the nation's most unequal state, with incomes at the 20th percentile nearly six times greater than the incomes at the 80th.\n\n4. Connecticut\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 80.8 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.9 years (14th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 6.0 years (6th largest)\n\nConnecticut has the highest concentration of primary doctors, dentists, and mental health providers per 100,000 people. The state has fourth lowest adult smoking rate as well as among the lowest shares of adults who report being in poor health.\n\n3. Minnesota\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 80.8 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 76.0 years (2nd highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.8 years (24th largest)\n\nMinnesota has been in the top three states for life expectancy since at least the 1980s. Socioeconomic factors, such as the fourth lowest poverty rate in the country and the lowest share of households living on less than $10,000 a year, may help explain this. The state also has the third lowest share of uninsured people, at only 4.4 percent compared to a national share of 8.7 percent.\n\nCalifornia (Photo: Art Wager / Getty Images)\n\n2. California\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 80.9 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 74.3 years (20th highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 6.6 years (3rd largest)\n\nResidents of California have significantly improved their lifestyle, improving average life expectancy in the state significantly, and jumping from the 20th position in 1980 to second in 2015. The Golden State has the third lowest share of obese adults, the fifth lowest share of adults who do not exercise, and the second lowest share of adults who smoke. Also, 268.8 people under age 75 die per 100,000 people every year, the third lowest premature mortality rate and well below the national rate of 336.4 per 100,000.\n\n1. Hawaii\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 2015: 81.3 years\n\n\u2022 Life expectancy at birth in 1980: 76.8 years (the highest)\n\n\u2022 1980-2015 life expectancy change: 4.5 years (23rd smallest)\n\nHawaii continues to be the state with the longest life expectancy year after year. The Aloha State has the second lowest obesity rate in the country, the third lowest smoking rate, and the among the primary care doctors and dentists per capita.\n\nThe state has the second lowest share of residents with no health insurance, which may explain why are only 23.3 preventable hospitalizations per 100,000 people, the lowest preventable hospitalization of all states.\n\nDetailed findings\n\nHigher incomes are closely associated with longer life expectancy. The difference in life expectancy at the age of 40 for Americans in the richest 1 percent and the poorest 1 percent is 15 years for men and 10 years for women, according to a 2016 research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOf the 23 states with a shorter life expectancy (at birth) that the average nationwide 17 have poverty rates that exceed that national rate of 13.4 percent. The opposite is generally the case across states with above-average life expectancies.\n\nExposure to air pollution, a general lack of access to health care, unhealthy behaviors, lack of access to healthy food, and other health risk factors -- which are all more common in poorer areas -- also contribute to lower life expectancies in some parts of the country.\n\nUnhealthy behaviors such as smoking and physical inactivity can also help explain an area\u2019s life expectancy. All but three of the 23 states with life expectancies at or below the national average report a higher adult smoking rate than the 17.0 percent national rate. Of the states with longer life expectancies, only seven report smoking rates that exceed the national rate.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the states with the longest and shortest life expectancy, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed 2010-2015 life expectancy at birth figures obtained from the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). Figures for life expectancy at birth in 1980 came from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Data on smoking, excessive drinking, and obesity rates came from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps program, a collaboration between RWJF and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Data on the 2017 income and poverty rates came from the U.S. Census Bureau. All data are for the most recent period available.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

His favorite meal is a cheeseburger and Cherry Coke. Newslook\n\nHere are some important questions the Oracle of Omaha could answer.\n\nWarren Buffett is set to release his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway(BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) shareholders on Saturday.\n\nThere's some information we know will be in there. For example, Buffett talks about how each of the company's major business segments performed and has a discussion of its major stock holdings.\n\nWe recently got a glimpse of what Buffett and his stock-pickers did with the company's stock portfolio during the fourth quarter, and it was underwhelming.\n\nIn short, with stocks plunging during that quarter and with more than $100 billion in cash sitting on its balance sheet, many investors expected Buffett and his team to go on a buying spree.\n\nHere are some specific questions investors should keep in mind when they're reading the letter.\n\nKing takes on colonel: Burger King trolls KFC' with new grilled chicken sandwich\n\nBeer battle: MillerCoors, Anheuser-Busch fight over farmers in aftermath of Bud Light ad\n\n(Photo: The Motley Fool)\n\nWhy did Berkshire have such an inactive fourth quarter?\n\nTo the surprise of many, Berkshire was barely a net buyer of stocks during the fourth quarter. The $5.6 billion it spent on on stock purchases was the lowest total in several quarters, and it was even less exciting when considering Berkshire sold several billion dollars in stock over the same time period.\n\nIn the letter, look for any clarification as to why. Did Buffett think stocks would keep falling? Is he holding on to cash in anticipation of a big acquisition in 2019?\n\nHow much cash does Berkshire have?\n\nSpeaking of cash, we can say with virtual certainty that Berkshire's cash hoard increased during the fourth quarter -- unless the company bought back a massive amount of its own stock. Berkshire finished the third quarter with $103.6 billion in cash, but given the stock portfolio activity and the cash-generating potential of Berkshire's businesses, I wouldn't be surprised if this ballooned to well over $110 billion by year's end.\n\nSuccession plan updates\n\nWarren Buffett is 88 years old, and Vice Chairman and right-hand-man Charlie Munger is 95. While we certainly hope both men are around for a while, the reality is that they won't be running Berkshire forever.\n\nOver the past few years, we've gradually learned more details about Berkshire's succession plans. Specifically, we know that Ted Weschler and Todd Combs are likely to take over the management of Berkshire's massive stock portfolio, and that potential CEO successors have been narrowed down to Ajit Jain and Greg Abel. Investors will be watching closely for any further clarification on Berkshire's plans for its future leadership.\n\nHow much money are Ted and Todd managing now?\n\nOver the past few years, Weschler and Combs have been given investment discretion over more and more of Berkshire's $200 billion investment portfolio. As of last year's letter, the two men were managing a combined $25 billion.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

More newsletters\n\nIt will be interesting to see the current total, as more and more of Berkshire's recent significant stock moves have been attributed to them, such as the recent sale of some Apple shares.\n\nHow much stock is Berkshire buying back?\n\nBerkshire modified its buyback authorization in mid-2018 to allow Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to buy back stock whenever both men agreed that it was trading at an attractive price. During the third quarter, the first after the modification was made, Berkshire bought back nearly $1 billion in stock.\n\nWell, if Berkshire thought its stock was undervalued during the third quarter, there were some times during the fourth quarter when Buffett and Munger may have really thought it was a good value.\n\nTax struggles: Some Americans face a costly surprise this tax season: tiny refunds or bigger bills\n\nThoughts on acquisitions\n\nTo be perfectly clear, Buffett doesn't want Berkshire to buy back stock. It would even be fair to say that investing in common stocks isn't Buffett's first choice when it comes to putting Berkshire's capital to work.\n\nBuffett wants to buy entire companies. Unfortunately, the acquisition environment has been less than ideal in recent years, to put it mildly. As Buffett said in last year's letter, one of his essential parameters for an acquisition is a \"sensible purchase price,\" and \"that last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far from spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high.\"\n\nIn other words, potential acquisition targets had been demanding unjustifiable premiums. I'm curious if this may have changed a bit as stock valuations came crashing down to reality in the latter part of 2018.\n\nBuffett's annual investing 'lesson'\n\nFinally, Buffett includes a valuable investing lesson in his letter every year, although we have no idea what the topic will be until the letter is published. For example, last year's letter contained a lesson about why index fund investing is smarter than investing in actively managed vehicles like hedge funds, and it included some of the important takeaways from Buffett's successful bet on a S&P 500 index fund over a 10-year period.\n\nOne thing is for sure: Buffett has some valuable investing wisdom in his mind, and Berkshire shareholders can't wait to hear a little more of it.\n\nMatthew Frankel, CFP, owns shares of Apple and Berkshire Hathaway (B shares).

However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nUnless you identify with Monica Gellar and Marie Kondo, I'm willing to bet cleaning does not top your list of your favorite things. And really, I don't blame you. Life is busy and we never really have as much time to clean as we want. But robot vacuums can help ease some of the burden of keeping your floors looking like you have it all.\n\nRight now, there's a really great deal on a robot vacuum we think you might like. The Ecovacs Deebot 901, which typically costs $399, is on sale for one day only at Amazon for $299. The lowest price we've seen on this vacuum until now was $349, so the extra $50 discount is super exciting.\n\nMore: The best affordable robot vacuums of 2019\n\nHow does this robot vacuum stack up against the competition?\n\nWe test a LOT of robot vacuums here at Reviewed, including this model, which is a slightly watered down version of the pricier Deebot Ozmo 930 ($449.99 at Amazon). It is not the best robot vacuum we've ever tested, but it's nowhere near the bottom of the barrel, either. It's got average suction power, but it's packed with features that set it apart from other models in this price range.\n\nWhat makes this robot vacuum special?\n\nThe Deebot 901 can connect to WiFi, which gives you control over the vacuum right from your phone, or with Alexa or Google Home voice commands. That's all well and good, and there are plenty of smart robot vacuums that offer this feature as well.\n\nWhere the 901 sets itself apart from other affordable smart robot vacuums is its laser guidance system. With Smart Navi 3.0 Navigation & Mapping, the 901 scans your home and builds a virtual map. From there, you can tell it where you do and do not want it to clean. This is great if you've got an open floor plan and a shag carpet that would stop any robot vacuum in its tracks. Overall, it stops the vacuum from going where it shouldn't, which is not a feature commonly found in this price range.\n\nThis robot vacuum also analyzes your floor plan and optimizes its cleaning path to be more efficient so it can clean more before its battery runs low. You can also schedule cleaning times, set it to clean when you're at work and forgot the in-laws are coming for dinner, and keep track of how it's performing. The app even lets you know if the Deebot encounters a problem so you can shut it off remotely if it does get stuck.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.

Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY\n\nSamsung has done what a year ago would have almost seemed impossible: The South Korean tech giant has managed to make all the $1,000 smartphones on the market sound cheap. Well, almost.\n\nThat\u2019s because the new Galaxy Fold foldable device costs roughly twice as much as those other handsets, and we\u2019re talking about the price of the \"entry\" 4G LTE version. You may have to take out a mortgage to afford the 5G model whose price has not yet been announced.\n\nIn what is arguably the biggest understatement ever applied to a smartphone, Samsung executive Justin Denison labeled the Galaxy Fold a \u201cluxury\u201d device.\n\nGalaxy Fold: As Galaxy S turns 10, Samsung looks to future with first foldable phone\n\nWhat buyers really want: Forget 5G and foldable. We just want it to last all day\n\nGalaxy S10: Samsung celebrates line's 10th anniversary with four new models\n\nSamsung Galaxy Fold (Photo: Samsung)\n\nActually, it might be shortchanging the Fold to pigeonhole it as a smartphone. Yes, in its folded form it functions as one, with a 4.6-inch display that should let you do all the usual things you do on an Android phone.\n\nThough when you unfold it \u2013 an action made possible through a hidden, interlocking hinge system \u2013 it is converted into a 7.3-inch tablet with enough screen real estate to display and use three apps at once.\n\nNo, this isn't the flip phone of yesteryear.\n\nAvailable April 26, in four color options \u2013 black, green, silver and blue \u2013 the Fold has six cameras and comes with 512 GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. It\u2019s got two separate built-in batteries. And onstage at its Galaxy Unpacked press event in San Francisco, Samsung demonstrated how apps such as Netflix or Google Maps viewed in \"phone mode\" can be expanded to take advantage of the larger tablet display.\n\nJudging how seamless all this turns out to be comes later, when we get our hands on the device and put it through its proper testing.\n\nIt's not too soon, though, to raise the question that has to be on most readers\u2019 minds: Is Samsung going to get any of you to come into the fold, given Galaxy Fold's sticker shock?\n\nThe front and back of Samsung's Galaxy Fold. (Photo: Samsung)\n\nPrior to Samsung\u2019s formal announcement of the Fold itself but with rumors floating around that some sort of foldable device was in the offing, USA TODAY, via SurveyMonkey Audience, asked smartphone buyers which features would get them excited about buying a new phone. Only 19 percent of those with an Android device said a flexible or foldable design would fill the bill.\n\nMeanwhile, in the same survey, only 3 percent of buyers said they were willing to spend more than $1,000 on any new smartphone. So you can only presume that puny number will get even smaller.\n\nThat may be beside the point, though. For one thing, many of us have pointed to smartphone innovation as having hit a wall these past several years. So whatever you end up thinking about the Fold, you can\u2019t say that it isn\u2019t different or doesn't represent change.\n\nAnd this is just the start of it. Other foldable phones of one type or another are believed to be coming along from LG, Lenovo, Xiaomi and Huawei.\n\nMoreover, while you can\u2019t fathom that this first Samsung Fold device will become a mainstream blockbuster, what will be telling, over time, is the reception it gets among affluent early adopters who do go out and buy the thing. (Yeah, you could see some people buying it as a status symbol.) If that reaction is positive and Samsung ultimately delivers a Galaxy Fold 2 or Fold 3, how expensive will those be? They\u2019re unlikely to be cheap either. But they ought to be at least closer in line with what some of you might be willing to pay.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/20/samsung-galaxy-fold-costs-nearly-2000-you-willing-spend-it/2930194002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/business/2019/02/21/nutella-shuts-down-factory-temporarily-over-quality-issues/39091903/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/money/2019/02/21/consumer-reports-top-car-picks-2019/2929891002/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/nation-now/2019/02/21/kfc-enlists-colonel-robocop-protect-secret-recipe-thieves/39091483/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/21/nafta-replacement-regional-trade-pact-could-derailed-drug-prices/2938919002/", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The clash over free trade in North America has long been fought over familiar issues: Low-paid Mexican workers. U.S. factories that move jobs south of the border. Canada's high taxes on imported milk and cheese.\n\nBut as Democrats in Congress consider whether to back a revamped regional trade pact being pushed by President Donald Trump, they're zeroing in on a new point of conflict: Drug prices. They contend that the new pact would force Americans to pay more for prescription drugs, and their argument has dimmed the outlook for one of Trump's signature causes.\n\nThe president's proposed replacement for the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement is meant to win over Democrats by incentivizing factories to hire and expand in the United States. Yet the pact would also give pharmaceutical companies 10 years' protection from cheaper competition in a category of ultra-expensive drugs called biologics, which are made from living cells.\n\nPrescription costs: Democrats examine drug prices\n\nBernie Sanders: Why is Catalyst Pharmaceutical pricing a once-free drug at $375,000?\n\nShielded from competition, critics warn, the drug companies could charge exorbitant prices for biologics.\n\n\"This is an outrageous giveaway to Big Pharma,\" Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said in an interview. \"The government guarantees at least 10 years of market exclusivity for biologic medicine. It's a monopoly. It's bad policy.\"\n\nThe objections of DeLauro and other Democrats suddenly carry greater potency. The need to curb high drug prices has become a rallying cry for voters of all political stripes. Trump himself has joined the outcry. The revamped North America trade deal must be approved by both chambers of Congress, and Democrats have just regained control of the House.\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, the new chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, told The Associated Press that \"I don't think candidly that it passes out of my trade subcommittee\" with the biologics provision intact.\n\n\"The biologics are some of the most expensive drugs on the planet,\" Blumenauer said.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

(Photo: Julio Cortez, AP)\n\nThe original NAFTA, which took effect in 1994, tore down most trade barriers separating the United States, Canada and Mexico. Like Trump, many Democrats blamed NAFTA for encouraging American factories to abandon the United States to capitalize on lower-wage Mexican labor and then to ship goods back into the U.S., duty-free.\n\nHaving long vilified NAFTA, Trump demanded a new deal \u2014 one far more favorable to the United States and its workers. For more than a year, his top negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, held talks with Canada and Mexico. Lighthizer managed to insert into the new pact provisions designed to appeal to Democrats and their allies in organized labor. For example, 40 percent of cars would eventually have to be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least $16 an hour \u2014 that is, in the United States and Canada and not in Mexico \u2014 to qualify for duty-free treatment.\n\nThe new deal also requires Mexico to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions.\n\nLate last year, the three countries signed their revamped deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. But it wouldn't take effect until their three legislatures all approved it. In the meantime, the old NAFTA remains in place.\n\n2019 tax season: How long should it take to get my tax refund this year?\n\nLots of compromise: What happens when your small business partner is also your spouse\n\nThe question now is: Are Democrats prepared to support a deal that addresses some of their key objections to NAFTA and thereby hand Trump a political victory? Some Democrats have praised the new provisions that address auto wages, though many say they must be strengthened before they'd vote for the USMCA.\n\nProtection for drug companies is another matter. Many Democrats had protested even when the Obama administration negotiated eight years of protection for biologics\u2014 from cheap-copycat competitors called \"biosimilars\" \u2014 in a 12-country Pacific Rim trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.\n\nTrump abandoned the TPP in his first week in office. But the pharmaceutical industry is a potent lobby in Washington, and Trump's negotiators pressed for protection for U.S. biologics in the new North American free trade deal. They ended up granting the drug companies two additional years of protection in the pact.\n\nTop biologics include the anti-inflammatory drug Humira, the cancer fighter Rituxan and Enbrel, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe administration and drug companies argue that makers of biologics need time to profit from their creations before biosimilars sweep in, unburdened by the cost of researching and developing the drugs. Otherwise, they contend, the brand-name drug companies would have little incentive to invest in developing new medicines.\n\nThey note that a 2015 law authorizing presidents to negotiate trade deals requires American officials to push other countries toward U.S.-level protections for intellectual property such as biologic drugs. (The same law, somewhat contradictorily, directs U.S. negotiators to \"promote access to medicines.\")\n\nSupporters also note that existing U.S. law gives makers of biologics 12 years' protection. So the new pact wouldn't change the status quo in the United States, though it would force Mexico to expand biologics' monopoly from five years and Canada from eight years. In fact, supporters of the biologics monopoly argue that the pact might cut prices in the United States because drug companies would no longer face pressure to charge Americans more to compensate for lower prices in Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut critics say that expanding biologics' monopoly in a trade treaty would prevent the United States from ever scaling back the duration to, say, the seven years the Obama administration once proposed.\n\n\"By including 10 years in a treaty, we are locking ourselves in to a higher level of monopoly protection for drugs that are already taking in billions of dollars a year,\" said Jeffrey Francer, general counsel for the Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents generic drug companies. \"The only way for Congress to change it is to back out of the treaty ... Does the United States want to be in violation of its own treaty?\"\n\nFor Democrats, higher drug prices are shaping up as a powerful political argument against approving the president's new North American trade deal. In December, Stanley Greenberg, a leading Democratic pollster and strategist, conducted focus groups in Michigan and Wisconsin with Trump voters who weren't affiliated with the Republican Party. Some had previously voted for Barack Obama. Others called themselves political independents. They're the kinds of voters Democrats hope to attract in 2020.\n\nGreenberg said he was \"shocked\" by the intensity of their hostility to drug companies \u2014 and to the idea that a trade pact would shield those companies from competition.\n\n\"It was like throwing a bomb into the focus group,\" said Greenberg, who is married to DeLauro. He said the voters' consensus view was essentially: \"The president was supposed to go and renegotiate (NAFTA) so that it worked for American workers. But it must be that these lobbyists are working behind the scenes\" to sneak in special-interest provisions.\n\nThat perception gives Democrats reason to reject the new pact as the 2020 election approaches.\n\n\"Democrats have no incentive to do this,\" said Philip Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a White House economist under President George W. Bush. \"Before you know it, the presidential election season is going to be upon us.\"\n\nU.S. trade rules are designed to force Congress to give trade agreements an up-or-down vote \u2014 no nitpicking allowed. Still, there are ways to bypass those restrictions. Congressional Democrats could, for example, push the administration to negotiate so-called side letters with Canada and Mexico to address their concerns. President Bill Clinton did this with the original NAFTA.\n\n\"Lighthizer and his team are very creative,\" said Blumenauer, chair of the House trade subcommittee. \"This is something that can be handled.\"\n\nFollow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at https://twitter.com/PaulWisemanAP\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/21/nafta-replacement-regional-trade-pact-could-derailed-drug-prices/2938919002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/smallbusiness/2019/02/21/running-small-business-couple-comes-tough-talk-compromise/2938605002/", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2013 Debbie and Gary Douglas sometimes need to remind each other, this is your business partner talking.\n\nIn business together for 16 years, the Douglases have found that being co-owners of a public relations firm requires them to be more direct with each other than they once were as spouses.

But the couple tried it again in 2013, this time with each of them handling specific responsibilities. She is a writer. He does the consulting and administrative tasks.\n\n\"My wife would far rather be free to do work for her clients \u2013 essentially working in the business while I'm working on the business,\" Ben Taylor says.\n\nWarren Buffett letter: 7 things to look for in his annual note to Berkshire shareholders\n\nBig beer battle: MillerCoors, Anheuser-Busch fight over farmers after Bud Light's Super Bowl ad\n\nSpouses who co-own companies say friction, while unpleasant in the moment, ultimately helps them strengthen their relationships.\n\n\"We have learned to get through disagreements the old-fashioned way \u2013 through arguing and eventually coming to a compromise that one or both of us are happy with,\" says Clinton Smith, who owns the retirement planning firm Government & Civil Employee Services with his husband, Galen Bargerstock.\n\nThe couple founded the business in 2010, five years into their relationship. At first, it was rocky. Smith remembers the fights they had over who should be doing what. But the company, based in Indiana, Pennsylvania, thrived, and \"this was when we knew no matter what, we had to keep working hard,\" Smith says.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

That's how Wendy and Scott Schultz reconciled their differing styles that, as Wendy Schultz put it, turned decision-making into a battlefield.\n\n\"I would see an opportunity to expand our business in the form of a new investment and would want to act quickly. He would see all of the reasons the investment could go wrong and wanted to take time to assess all the pros and cons,\" says Wendy Schultz, CEO of The Simple Life Hospitality. The Green Bay, Wisconsin-based company invests in and manages vacation rental properties; Schultz founded it in 2013 and her husband joined her in 2016.\n\nDebbie Douglas, left, and her husband and business partner, Gary, pose for a photo in Newport Beach, Calif. on Feb. 6, 2019. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP)\n\nThere was also tension between the couple over who was in charge, and the fact that running a business isn't a 9-to-5 occupation, like the job Scott Schultz previously worked at. They began working with a coach to understand and change their dynamics.\n\n\"There wasn't a defining moment where we resolved our differences, but over time, we've found ways to make our styles complementary for the success of our business,\" Wendy Schultz says. \"Through our own trial and error, we've developed a happy medium.\"\n\nSometimes, working well together takes brutal honesty. Cynthia Smoot remembers struggling with her husband Randy for several years after she joined his advertising agency, Gangway Advertising, in 2008. They had an ongoing clash of egos and a hard time accepting each other's point of view. She remembers one argument during which he was pretty blunt.\n\n\"You want to do your own thing? What do you think you're bringing to the table?\" Cynthia Smoot recalls her husband saying. \"Some things that I thought were strengths, he saw as weakness. That was an eye-opening exercise.\"\n\nPart of the problem was too much closeness \u2013 being together 24/7 didn't work. So, they transitioned from sharing a home office to two separate rooms in different parts of their house in Dallas.\n\n\"I was as far away as I could get from him,\" Cynthia says. \"I told him, 'don't even come walking in here. Google-chat me!'\"\n\nNow, she says, they share harmony and a successful company.\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at @JoyceMRosenberg.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/smallbusiness/2019/02/21/running-small-business-couple-comes-tough-talk-compromise/2938605002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2019/02/18/best-deals-week-walmart-and-jet-com-kitchenaid-dyson-vacuums-ipads-and-more/2904069002/", "text": "These are the 5 best Walmart deals you can get right now\n\nSave money on home products and more with these deals.

Thankfully, every so often you can find a brand new one at a reasonable price. The Dyson V8, for instance, is our second favorite cordless vacuum, and right now it's nearly half off at Walmart. We loved this vacuum because it comes with a ton of useful attachments, picked up a bunch of dirt and debris, and can run up to 40 minutes on a single charge.

Thankfully, robot vacuums exist to keep things nice and tidy before deeper cleanings, and right now you can get a Eufy Robovac 11 for just $180. In our tests, we found that the Robovac 11 has great pickup and was easy to control compared to other robot vacuums.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nTravel season never stops, which means you always need some sturdy, trusted luggage for when you're on the go.\n\nWhether by plane, train, boat, car, bus or horse and buggy, wherever you're going, you also have to get your stuff there with you. That means hauling bags across airports, shoving them into cargo bins and re-arranging bags to make everything fit.\n\nBut it's not all travel doom and gloom, below is a list of the best luggage bags and accessories that we tested in 2019 along with some other popular picks that will have you traveling practically, stylishly and comfortably \u2014 until you hit airport security lines, of course.\n\n1. The best checked luggage bag we tested: Travelpro Platinum Magna 2 29\" Expandable Spinner Suiter\n\nTravelpro (Photo: Seamus Bellamy/Reviewed)\n\nTravelpro's Platinum Magna 2 is the best suitcase to invest in right now. It\u2019s made well enough that it\u2019ll survive years of vacations, trips back and forth from university, or extended business travel.\n\nThe 29-inch design offers 137 liters of packing space, which was more than adequate to house all of the items we packed into it during testing. Its rugged Cordura exterior ensures it'll come out of your plane's cargo hold in one piece, no worse for wear.\n\nThere are also plenty of pockets to fit and house your every need on both the interior and exterior of the bag, while the bag itself is expandable, too. You should know that while this suitcase does come in a couple of different colors, it\u2019s not the most stylish bag. For something a little more fashionable, check out The Large AWAY Travel Suitcase or the Briggs & Riley Large Expandable Spinner.\n\nGet the Travelpro Platnum Magna Expandable Spinner Suiter on Amazon for $326.81\n\n2. The best hard-sided checked bag we tested: The Large AWAY Travel Suitcase\n\nAWAY bag (Photo: Seamus Bellamy/Reviewed)\n\nIf you're looking for a new hard-sided suitcase to take on your next adventure, we think that The Large AWAY Travel Suitcase is a great option. Its tough yet flexible polycarbonate outer shell is available in a wide variety of colors and\u2014with its textured, matte finish\u2014is less susceptible to picking up scuffs and dirt than other hard-sided suitcases that we considered or tested.\n\nThere aren't any pockets on the outside of this suitcase, but the roomy interior features several mesh pockets and a clip-in compression panel that'll help you keep your belongings organized while you're on the road. As your trip wears on, you'll be able to separate your dirty clothes from your clean stuff using the suitcase's included laundry bag. And once everything you want to take with you is safely packed away, you can secure your belongings with the built-in combination lock.\n\nOur only real beef with The Large AWAY Travel Suitcase is that its wheels didn't always track well on rough terrain, but this isn't a serious enough issue to keep us from recommending it.\n\nGet the Large AWAY Travel Suitcase for $295\n\n3. The best wheeled carry-on bag we tested: Samsonite MightLight 2 21\" Spinner\n\nSamsonite (Photo: Seamus Bellamy/Reviewed)\n\nThe Samsonite MightLight 2 is the best carry-on bag of the moment. Despite the bag's total dimensions, the carry handle op top compressed down far enough that I was able to fit it into our sizing device, wheels and all\u2014and what wheels they are.\n\nThe bag's wheels are strong enough to handle tough surfaces with ease and it's also easy to maneuver, with plenty of handles for carrying. And as for pockets, there is plenty of space for all your carry-on needs, plus clothes and other smaller items plus a TSA-approved lock to seal the main compartment.\n\nThe only real complaint about this bag is that when not in use, it can\u2019t be compressed down for storage. If that\u2019s a deal breaker, check out our pick for Best Soft-Sided Carry-On.\n\nGet the Samsonite MightLight Spinner on Amazon for $199.99\n\n4. The best soft-sided carry-on bag we tested: Tom Bihn Aeronaut 45\n\nTom Binh (Photo: Seamus Bellamy/Reviewed)\n\nThe Aeronaut 45 is small enough to fit easily into an overhead compartment and can be compressed to make it even smaller for storage. It has waterproof zippers and comes in two different fabrics that will wear tough or stay cleaner in a variety of colors.\n\nThe frameless Aeronaut 45 feels featherlight compared to a spinner. Tom Bihn equipped the bag with handles, backpack straps and the ability to attach a shoulder strap for all modes of transportation.\n\nAnd in terms of compartments, the bag has a big main compartment that allows for organization in any way you choose and smaller ones on either end of the bag with tiny compartments in them.\n\nGet the Tom Binh Aeronaut for $295\n\n5. One of our favorite hard-shell carry-ons: The AWAY Carry-On\n\nAWAY Carry On (Photo: AWAY)\n\nWhile we haven't tested AWAY's The Carry-On yes, people are obsessed with it. We did test AWAY's checked luggage and it won our best hardshell suitcase, so we know they make great stuff.\n\nIt even comes in millennial pink, which is a popular color for the bag.\n\nGet the AWAY Carry-On for $225\n\n6. One of our favorite luxury checked bags: The Tumi Alpha 2 Carry On\n\nTumi (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe Tumi Alpha 2 Carry On is a bag we have not tested, but is one we like for those who are willing to spring for a higher-end bag. The Tumi is a popular bag and has plenty of space and features to back up its price tag.\n\nGet the Tumi Alpha 2 for $625\n\n7. The best packing cubes for travelers who need every inch: eBags Six-Piece Packing Cube Value Set\n\neBags (Photo: Seamus Bellamy/Reviewed)\n\nThis set of six packing cubes from eBags is a great choice for anyone looking to organize the contents of their suitcase or carry-on.\n\nFor just under $50, you get a number of different-sized cubes for different items that allow you to organize with ease.\n\nThe cubes are made of lightweight nylon and boast durable, fully finished interior seams, along with YKK zippers that open and close easily. eBags also sells similar cubes in a sets of three and four, in case you usually have more or less stuff to pack.\n\nGet the eBags Packing Cubes on Amazon for $44.99\n\n8. The best luggage scales for travelers to pre-weigh bags: Dr. Meter Digital Luggage Scale\n\nDr. Meter (Photo: Seamus Bellamy/Reviewed)\n\nThe Dr. Meter Digital Luggage Scale is our pick for the best luggage scale, and it wins on a number of fronts. Most importantly, it was able to accurately measure all of the weights we threw at it to within a few decimal places, and it can do so in either pounds or kilograms. It comes with a bright and easy-to-read backlit display, its buttons are well placed, and its aluminum and plastic body feels tough enough to provide years of service. Since it only weighs 3.25 ounces, you\u2019ll never even notice that you have it with you until it comes time to put it to use.\n\nTo use it, you simply turn it on, attach it to the handle of your luggage, and lift. Easy. Once it obtains a solid reading, the measurement shows up solidly on the display.\n\nGet the Dr. Meter Digital Luggage Scale on Amazon for $8.99\n\nThe contents of this story originally appeared on Reviewed.com.

Tax preparation companies such as TurboTax and H&R Block are also filing tax returns to the IRS on behalf of their customers beginning Monday.\n\nThe agency recalled all its employees after the government reopened on Friday. It said in a statement Monday that it's \"working to promptly resume normal operations.\"\n\nThe IRS expects 150 million individual returns to be filed this year, with the first refunds to go out in the first week of February. In general, the agency expects most refunds to be issued in less than 21 days. You can check the status of your refund by going to the agency's \"Where's my refund?\" tool online or by mobile app.\n\nColored square beads spelling out TAXES.

Soon, you'd expect the couple to run out the door, jump in the car and head to a more budget-friendly spot with a drive thru. Stay tuned.\n\nThe bank can help consumers who want to participate track spending by category as the customer uses Huntington debit and credit cards.\n\nThe bank can help you get started by setting up a few budget categories based on your spending history. Beginning in early 2019, the Heads Up program will integrate artificial intelligence tools to provide customers with up to 40 key insights into their financial wellness as they set goals.\n\nTalking about money around the kitchen table\n\nHarmening said the \"Heads Up\" approach came out of focus meetings where bankers literally sat with customers in their homes around the kitchen table asking them what matters the most to them. He said the \"proverbial kitchen table\" is the centerpiece of where real conversations happen.\n\nThe bank created what it calls \"The Hub,\" a new digital banking experience that's free to all its customers. The bank is able to review spending trends for the past 12 months and help people set a budget. The bank's philosophy is that it's not just big events that require some planning and a heads up. Little everyday moments need some financial planning, too.\n\nThe game plan includes helping customers categorize their spending so they can better understand how to change some habits going forward. Customers also are able to set up a monthly spending limit by category. So if you only want to spend $100 a month on eating out, you'd do a better job tracking that spending throughout the month.\n\nMore: Government shutdown: How small businesses are hurt\n\nMore: 7 things small businesses should do when fighting inflation\n\nMore: 5 ways to trim businesses expenses, cut costs and make more money in 2019\n\nA look-ahead calendar also provides a financial view of the month to come, so customers get a better handle on when bills and deposits will hit their accounts and plan accordingly.\n\nSuch programs can help customers review where they're already spending money. As a result, for example, customers may find it easier to spot recurring subscriptions to services they didn't even realize they were still paying for but not using.\n\nCustomers said they wanted help keeping their financial goals front and center, according to Huntington.\n\n\"They said: 'Make it easy. Be proactive. We might not always appreciate it. But we need it,' \" Harmening said.\n\nWatch out for big and small money drains\n\nMost people can use some help tracking the big money drains in their life. Maybe it's all that money they're spending buying lunch each day. Or getting a coffee on the way to work. Or splurging on a new video game or a new sweater a few times a month.\n\nMaybe you spend too much money when you're trying to impress a date. Or you're overtired and shopping online late at night.\n\nIn the old days, people would talk about using spending envelopes to set aside cash that you can use on groceries or rent. Or people would be encouraged to write down how much they were spending each day on incidentals.\n\nNow we're living in a digital world where you are able to set up another sort of system. For those already facing big bills, tracking small expenditures really can add up and help with a budget.\n\nTake someone who is juggling college loan payments. \"What happens with student lending is it creates pressure on your cash flow,\" Harmening said.\n\nBut if you're able to suddenly save an extra $100 or $200 a month, it makes it a lot easier to pay that $300 student loan bill each month.\n\nKicking mindless money habits is a theme that we'll likely hear more about in the New Year.\n\nAfter big spending moments \u2013 which can include everything from Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales to holiday gift giving and trips to visit family \u2013 plenty of households start out 2019 in the red. Even finding small ways to cut back right now can help as many wait it out before receiving a big tax refund in February or March.\n\nTake something out of the cart and put it back\n\nAlly Bank announced in late December that it put 48 of its customers to a test of sorts with four savings challenges to overcome \"absent-minded and needless spending habits.\"\n\nOn average, the bank said, the customers found they could easily save $50 using just one of the strategies.\n\nHow did they do it? Some took a hard look at what they were buying each week and then focused on cutting out one or two such purchases each week.\n\nSome signed up for a \"shopping cart challenge\" and agreed to review what's in the grocery cart before they check out. Then they'd remove a few items each trip, particularly if the goods turned out to be more of a \"want\" than an legitimate \"need.\"\n\nSome eliminated spending money each month on services that they weren't using each month \u2013 such as streaming music, online video games and the like. Others aimed to shop \"responsibly\" online. The idea was to leave items in the online cart, wait a while and then avoid making whatever purchases that you can.\n\nSome found the best savings by reconsidering their online purchases by waiting a day or two.\n\nMindfulness is a buzzword for all sorts of things these days. Being aware of your present self and surroundings can help cut back on stress, improve sleep and, yes, maybe even control your spending.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nHospitals across the country rang in the New Year with a federal mandate to reveal their once-secret master price lists, although it's unclear whether the new requirement will assist many patients or contain ever-rising health care costs.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, hospitals must publish online the starting price tags for every service or procedure. These detailed lists, known as chargemasters, include thousands of entries.\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act required hospitals to make these lists available to the public, but until this week, hospitals were not required to publish them. The new mandate marks an effort by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to improve price transparency in health care.\n\nHowever, health care experts stress that consumers \u2013 even those with high-deductible plans or even no insurance \u2013 should not consider these lists to be realistic price guides.\n\nMore: Is one of your New Year's resolutions to exercise more?

Hungry diners want even more convenience than having food handed to them through their car windows: They want it brought directly to their homes, offices or hangouts.\n\nUber Eats, Seamless, DoorDash and Grubhub are among the third-party services that announced new partnerships, while Domino's tried delivering to places without regular street addresses, like parks and landmarks.\n\n\"The consumer is demanding it in a lot of markets,\" said Jefferies equity analyst Andy Barish. \"Most of the industry has partnered up in 2018.\"\n\nJohn Zolidis, president of Quo Vadis Capital, credited all the improvement in restaurant sales in 2018 versus 2017 to delivery, with delivery growing by 9 percent this past year as compared to 4 percent in 2017 and 2016.\n\n\"The reason why people are gaga for delivery is it's a channel that\u2019s growing,\" he said. \"The reason for that is it feeds into the e-commerce-enabled customer's desire for convenience and customization.

The desire to drum up business plays a big role.\n\n\"Lots of brands are trying to connect with younger consumers who have a social conscience and purpose.

Now, with the launch of its Amazon Go store of the future last January, Amazon's impact on brick-and-mortar retail may be even more direct.\n\nThe core of the Amazon Go experience is simple: no lines or checkout required. Instead, customers enter the store and scan the Amazon Go app they've downloaded on their iPhone or Android handset, and from then on, they're good to go even if the battery on the device dies.\n\nAmazon says the Just Walk Out technology used in Amazon Go stores is similar to the technology found in self-driving cars: incorporating computer vision, sensors and \u201cdeep learning.\u201d\n\nWhen a product is lifted off a store shelf, it is automatically added to a virtual cart. Put it back, and it\u2019s removed. When customers are finished shopping, they can just walk out of the store with their items. Their Amazon account is charged automatically, and Amazon will send a receipt later.\n\nThough a key point is to be able to avoid long check out lines, there are still Amazon employees in the store, should shoppers need any kind of help.\n\nThere are questions about whether the concept can work in stores that sell bigger ticket items than the bread, milk and other meal and snack options that are found in the Go stores.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily work in every retail segment,'' says Mark Bunney, director of go-to-market strategy at Ingenico, a company that helps merchants with payments solutions. \"I think it\u2019s going to be an evolution for retailers, and you\u2019re not going to see it overnight change from the current format.\u201d\n\nFor now, Amazon has opened four stores in its Seattle backyard, including a small freestanding one with restricted access inside a Macy\u2019s. Three more Amazon Go stores have opened in Chicago and one in San Francisco, with more planned in those cities, and elsewhere. Bloomberg has reported, citing unnamed sources, that Amazon is considering opening as many as 3,000 Amazon Go stores by the end of 2021.\n\nShoppers can use Home Depot's mobile app to find various products. (Photo: Home Depot)\n\nGap Inc. has also rolled out the tech. It's placed price checkers primarily in its Old Navy stores so shoppers can scan an item's barcode to find out the cost. And when a product is dwindling on the shelves, employees at Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta and, increasingly, Old Navy stores receive alerts on their mobile devices through an app.\n\nPreviously, 40 percent of the time items believed to be out of stock were actually still available in the back of the store, the company says. Thanks to the app\u2019s ability to better track inventory, the out-of-stock rate has fallen to 1 percent.\n\n\u201cTo make a trip to the store, there needs to be a reason beyond what you can experience just sitting on your couch,'' says Sebastian Di Grande, Gap Inc.'s executive vice president of strategy and chief customer officer. \"It\u2019s not just technology for technology\u2019s sake There\u2019s a tremendous amount of opportunity for us ... so we\u2019ve been addressing and exploiting that opportunity as much as we possibly can and as quickly as we possibly can.\u2019\u2019\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nIndustry observers and players agree that there is much more change to come.\n\n\u201cI think we are in the beginning stages,'' says Santa Cruz, noting that tech innovations are often tested in just a handful of markets or locations. \"For technologists like us and also retailers to be able to learn the most from what customers want, it has to be rolled out at scale.''\n\nBut the more shoppers get used to experiences like paying for purchases with their mobile phones, she says, the bigger the push will likely be for more tech innovations.\n\nBy the end of this year, 60 percent of all retail locations in the U.S. will support Apple Pay, Apple says. Some of the newest chains to accept it are Costco and Neiman Marcus where shoppers can now use Apple Pay at more than 40 stores.\n\nThe growing number of online retailers opening up physical storefronts should also usher in new concepts.\n\n\"I think that will elevate the entire retail landscape,'' Santa Cruz says. \"I think in the next two years we'll see a lot of retail change.\"\n\nAmong the concepts on the horizon: more use of virtual and augmented reality.\n\nMastercard has worked with Saks Fifth Ave. on a prototype in which customers can stroll around a store wearing smart glasses and digitally dress a mannequin with items they see and like. If they decide to buy, their identity is verified with a scan of the iris. Then they make their purchase through Masterpass, Mastercard's digital payment service.\n\n\"It's about finding the right experience,'' says Stephane Wyper, Mastercard's senior vice president for new commerce partnerships and commercialization. \"I think we're going to see more demand and adoption in the next year or so in the augmented reality'' space.\n\nRetailers have only just begun, says Di Grande of Gap Inc.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done,'' he says. \"These (concepts) are the tip of the iceberg.''\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/12/27/amazon-shopping-experience-makes-retailers-up-their-tech-game/2350988002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/12/06/taxes-2018-you-owe-year-get-refund/2207406002/", "text": "CLOSE The higher standard deduction in the tax law signed by Donald Trump last year may require a few new moves for you to lessen your tax burden this year.

It also estimates what percentage of state residents will owe more, less, or the same compared with 2017.\n\nThe calculator also can be customized by income, filing status and number of dependents to provide a rough idea of what to expect from your federal return in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe are helping taxpayers understand their total tax picture,\u201d says Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant and tax expert with TurboTax.\n\nTurboTax gave USA TODAY early, exclusive access to the calculator.

The average savings in Colorado, Massachusetts and Texas, for example, could total $1,000 or more.\n\nIn most states, about 80 percent of tax filers will owe less than they did for 2017. Between 3 percent and 5 percent of taxpayers will owe more on average in each state, including New York. There are a handful of states where a higher proportion of filers are estimated to owe more, including California, Connecticut and Georgia at 6 percent; New Jersey at 7 percent; and Maryland at 8 percent.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

More newsletters\n\nPeople who earn up to $25,000 benefit from the new tax law the least, I found.\n\nFor instance, 62 percent of New Yorkers in that lowest income bracket will owe less in 2018, compared with 83 to 96 percent of New York residents in the higher income groups. Instead, 36 percent of these lower-income taxpayers will see no change to what they owe to Uncle Sam versus 2017.\n\nThat disparity holds true across the states, I noticed. There are a couple of reasons for this, Greene-Lewis says. First, the tax rate stayed at 10 percent for those in the lowest income range, while the rate was reduced between 1 to 4 percent for higher incomes.\n\nPeople with lower incomes also may not get the full benefit of the child tax credit, which was doubled by the new tax law but remains non-refundable. That means the credit can't reduce your tax liability below zero and be refunded to you.\n\nItemize vs. standard deduction\n\nThe tool also provides several tabs at the bottom to illustrate how some of the biggest changes from the tax law will affect taxpayers, including the higher standard deduction, the cap on state and local taxes, and the doubling of the child credit.\n\nLet's take the standard deduction, which increased to $12,000 from $6,350 in 2017 for single filers and to $24,000 from $12,700 for married couples filing jointly. TurboTax forecasts that 90 percent of taxpayers will take the standard deduction for 2018, up from 70 percent the year before.\n\nPass the SALT\n\nAnother big change from the tax legislation is the $10,000 limit placed on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT. Previously, taxpayers could deduct all income, property and sales taxes they paid during the tax year to their state or municipality.\n\nThe new cap hurts taxpayers in states with high income and property taxes, such as California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and the District of Columbia.\n\nTo ease the pain, many who took the SALT deduction last year will skip itemizing and take the higher standard deduction instead. In New York, the TurboTax calculator estimates that 70 percent of taxpayers who deducted SALT last year will switch to the standard deduction. The result: 88 percent will owe less, while 12 percent will owe more. I'm hoping to be in the first camp.\n\nGet specific\n\nTurboTax\u2019s calculator also shows how your filing status (single or married), your income and the number of dependents you have affect your tax situation. Children can be a big help.\n\nThe child tax credit increased to $2,000 from $1,000 per child, while a new $500 credit for non-child dependents was created. These credits also don't phase out until a married couple\u2019s income exceeds $400,000, up from $110,000 previously.\n\nEntering my specific tax filing situation for household income (above $150,000), dependents (only one) and filing status (married), here's what I found.\n\nTurboTax estimates that I will owe $4,600 less in 2018 than in 2017. Eighty-six percent of similar filers will owe less, and 14 percent will owe more. Again, fingers crossed for that first group.\n\nOf course, this is a general estimate, and such factors as my paycheck withholdings, gains or losses from asset sales, mortgage interest and charitable contributions, affect my 2018 tax return.\n\n\u201cThe calculator should be used as an educational tool,\" Greene-Lewis says, \"that allows taxpayers to easily get a deeper understanding of how the new tax law impacts taxpayers with similar situations.\u201d\n\nCLOSE With the 2019 tax season around the corner, here are some deductibles you probably didn't know about.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWithout fail, my wife and I randomly acquire a fresh calendar every December.\n\nIt\u2019s always something different, and we always come to possess it in some peculiar way. A few years ago, a funeral home sent us one with Norman Rockwell images. Then one year, my mother-in-law bought us a calendar filled with pugs. And this year, my 6-year-old son made us a calendar at school, adorned with pictures he drew representing each month, including a Picasso-esque picture of his mother for the month of May.\n\nI love calendars. But not for the images. I\u2019m a numbers guy. I\u2019m interested in identifying when I\u2019ll catch my breaks. I\u2019m going to catch at least three breaks in 2019. The first occurs in January, the next in July and then potentially a couple later in the year. By identifying them sooner rather than later, I\u2019m able to take full advantage of them when they arrive.\n\nI want to help you find your breaks. Anecdotally, I\u2019ve observed most people catch three breaks per year, but depending on how your financial life runs, you might be fortunate to receive more than three.\n\nMore: Why you can stop worrying about having a perfect credit score\n\nMore: Financial planning: How to meet your money goals in 2019\n\nMore: Worry, then be happy: Having a plan to tackle your financial fears can offer relief\n\nA break, for our purposes, is when you experience an unordinary influx of money or the disappearance of a monthly obligation. What you choose to do with that break is another story, which we\u2019ll address here in a moment. But before you leverage it or waste it, you first need to know how to identify one.\n\nThere are two types of breaks you should be looking for. The first involves more money than usual flowing into your household in a given month. And the second sort of break involves the temporary absence of an expense that you\u2019re used to dealing with.\n\nThe most obvious example of an influx of money is an income tax refund. We\u2019ll save the debate as to whether or not getting a refund is a good idea for another day, but when the money finally arrives, it still feels like extra money.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

More newsletters\n\nThe frequency in which your employer pays you can also create breaks for your financial life. If you happen to get paid every other week, then there will be two months in which you receive three paychecks. Most of the people I know who receive biweekly paychecks set their household budget around two pays per month. Therefore the three-pay months represent opportunity. In fact, these two \u201cextra\u201d pays account for nearly eight percent of your annual earnings. You wouldn\u2019t want to waste eight percent of your annual earnings, would you?\n\nFor those paid weekly, there are two months in which you receive five paychecks instead of four. While these two extra pays only represent about four percent of your annual wages, they still aren\u2019t worth wasting. Sorry if you get paid monthly or twice per month; there are no breaks in this category for you.\n\nOn the other end of the break spectrum you will find expenses which are temporarily suspended.\n\nFor instance, achieving the maximum contribution level for retirement accounts or health savings accounts (HSAs) before December can lead to a bigger paycheck. Because once the accounts are maxed out for the year, the deductions from your paychecks cease. And depending on your wage level, you may also max out the amount of FICA or Social Security tax you\u2019re required to pay. Again, this will result in a larger paycheck, once your obligation is satisfied.\n\nThe best way to evaluate the breaks I mentioned, and other opportunities, is to grab a calendar and spend time thinking your way through the year. Determine what expenses get eliminated and what additional income flows into your household.\n\nAnd while the idea of catching a financial break is certainly appealing, wasting the opportunity to create stability or calm is a common reality because of poor foresight and planning. Catching a break is great when you harness it to stabilize your life. Catching a break to simply blow money, on the other hand, will put more pressure on your finances.\n\nI can\u2019t put a bow on this topic until I illuminate the dark side of knowing the timing of your breaks. I\u2019m of course talking about the perpetual rescue. If you know help is right around the corner, you may be inclined to create your own trouble. You know, lean into the scheduled influx. This is precisely what people do with income tax refunds when they use them to pay off credit card debt year after year after year. Running up the tab only to pay it off with a planned break is a misuse of a good opportunity.\n\nGrab your calendar, find your breaks and create stability. Those are this week\u2019s marching orders.\n\nPeter Dunn is an author, speaker and radio host, and he has a free podcast: Million Dollar Plan. Have a question about money for Pete the Planner?

Critics and gamers hailed the game as a masterpiece and work of art exhibiting an unyielding commitment to realism.\n\nBut after Rockstar Games, the company behind RDR2, last week unlocked a beta version of \"Red Dead Online,\" a multiplayer expansion of the game last week, many of its fans have mercilessly lambasted the company for what they decried as an economy that seems designed to eventually force gamers to use real world money to balance it out. As a result, players who once marveled over intricate details \u2013 like how the horses physically responded to weather changes \u2013 now post rants online about the price of a virtual can of beans.\n\n\u201cThis online economy is a mess,\u201d is a common refrain from RDR2 gamers on the website Reddit, where commenters have compared it to the dire, real-life situation in modern Venezuela.\n\nThe online game\u2019s missions pay out a period-appropriate pittance, they say, but the items for sale \u2013 which can be anything from varmint rifles to hair pomade \u2013 are oppressively priced.\n\n\"Red Dead Redemption 2\" (Photo: Rockstar Games)\n\nDisgruntled players on Reddit have become amateur historians and economists, digging up century-old ads to prove that a Mauser pistol only cost $35 in 1899, roughly one-thirtieth of what the online game charged at launch. Others have used inflation calculators to ridicule the price of goods, such as RDR2's virtual can of baked beans, which at $1.20 in the game would equate to nearly $40 in today's real dollars.\n\nEverything costs so much fake money that rather than enjoying the missions and other aspects of the game, players say they turned full-time to \"grinding\" \u2013 hunting and fishing for hours in order to scrape themselves out of poverty. During the virtual visit to Valentine, the grimy town butcher had a constant line at his stand to pawn animal skins and carcasses, bringing to mind a soup queue during the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cThe game might look good, but you tell me \u2013 is this what you want to be spending your time doing?\u201d Anas asked. His redhead received $38.44 from the butcher for her efforts, not even a dent in the cost of the thousand-dollar Mauser pistol sitting like an unattainable bauble in the gun shop's catalog.\n\nRockstar, whose parent company is the New York-based Take-Two Interactive, has pointed out that the game\u2019s online version is still in beta mode. On Thursday, the company responded to the criticism by reducing in-game costs, increasing gameplay rewards and even issuing gifts and refunds to players who had paid the previous exorbitant prices for goods.\n\nAs an added thank you, we're also awarding everyone that joined in to play the Red Dead Online Beta at any point thru midnight PST today with a gift of RDO$250 and 15 Gold Bars. Gifts should start arriving today and will hit all eligible players by Friday Dec 14. \u2014 Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) December 6, 2018\n\nRockstar did not respond to a request for comment for this story. But in a post on Rockstar's web site Thursday, the company said that the changes were the \"first set of adjustments\" to the online game \"geared towards creating a more balanced, fun and rewarding overall experience, across all modes and missions.\"\n\nBut the controversy is indicative of broader issues in the industry that aren\u2019t going away. Video games are becoming increasingly online-based, which means the financial transaction doesn't need to end after someone plunks down $60 for a disc. The potentially limitless opportunities for downloading additional game content range from a prequel that feels like a whole new game to something frivolous such as horse armor.\n\nOften it works, and players happily spend more money to add a new chapter or episode to a hit game or to customize a character. But in some cases, the dynamic can leave gamers feeling like developers are specifically engineering games to make them unplayable unless they constantly shell out money for a game they already bought.\n\nRockstar has not yet introduced to \"Red Dead Online\" the ability to complete microtransactions, the term for in-game purchases in which players can pay for online goods with real money. Critics have derided microtransactions as turning the meritocracy of video gaming on its head, especially when the games involve player-vs-player battles. For example, a player willing to spend real money to upgrade from a pistol to a tank could have an advantage over someone who tries to earn the upgrade by completing tasks within the game.\n\nSome \"Red Dead Online\" players have theorized that the game economy\u2019s hyperinflation was setting the table for those willing to skip the endless hunting and fishing grind by simply entering their credit card information for that brand new Mauser.\n\nThe company continues to make a fortune on microtransactions off of its other massive and ongoing hit, \"Grand Theft Auto V,\" a game that was first released in 2013. On top of roughly $6 billion Rockstar earned from retail game revenue, it has reaped an additional $1.5 billion in \"GTA Online\" microtransactions as players bought supercars and helicopters, according to Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities and a longtime video game industry analyst.\n\nBut players should be open-minded and realize that the game is still in beta testing mode, Pachter says. Other popular games, even longtime hit World of Warcraft had some initial bad reviews, he says. \u201cThey fixed everything people didn\u2019t like as they went,\u201d Pachter said. \u201cI am certain (Rockstar is) going to fix it and this is making a mountain out of a mole hill.\u201d\n\nGame designers and publishers have a vested interest in tweaking an online game to suit its gamers, says Scott Steinberg, trends expert for consulting and research firm TechSavvy Global and founder of Select Magazine: Your Cities Secrets Unlocked. \u201cHowever, anytime you introduce economics into a game \u2013 let alone one of this size, scale, and popularity \u2013 they\u2019re going to be subject to extreme scrutiny, especially coming from a developer and publisher of Rockstar\u2019s profile and pedigree,\u201d he said.\n\nCriticism about games seems to be growing. The outcry over \u201cRed Dead Online\u201d follows other recent video game kerfuffles, including gamers last month flooding Metacritic with negative reviews of recently released game \u201cFallout 76\u201d and rioting on social media and during the real-world unveiling of the upcoming multiplayer mobile \"Diablo Immortal\" at the Blizzcon convention.\n\nComplaints about the glitches in \"Fallout 76\" are \"legit,\u201d Pachter said. But in the case of the \"Diablo\" announcement, gamers are \u201ccomplaining because they wanted something else,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks to the internet, everyone has a venue to vent. But that doesn\u2019t mean they should, Pachter said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean all gamers are entitled whiny little babies. There is a very, very vocal 2 percent who are really whiny and there\u2019s probably 10 percent who kind of feel the same way and don\u2019t whine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most people scratch their heads and say, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe injection of real money into virtual worlds has created significant financial, ethical and legal dilemmas for game makers. \"Red Dead Online\" players suspect the online version has two systems of currency \u2013 dollars and gold bars, the latter which are extremely difficult to accumulate and will likely be purchasable through microtransactions \u2013 so that poker and blackjack can be introduced into online play without the developers being accused of establishing an illegal gambling platform.\n\nAnd last week, Federal Trade Commission chairman Joe Simons said his agency would investigate \u201cloot boxes,\u201d randomized prize packages online players can pay for in many games that critics have compared to gambling. International Game Developers Association executive director Jen MacLean responded to the probe by calling for the game industry to create a standard approach to loot boxes.\n\n\u201cWe cannot ignore the fact that video games face increased scrutiny, concern, and regulation because of their immersive nature,\u201d MacLean wrote in a letter to the video game industry.\n\nTake-Two\u2019s president Karl Slatoff has said that he does not consider loot boxes to be gambling, though the company has not disclosed whether it plans to introduce them to \"Red Dead Online.\"\n\nSome game developers have turned to experts to grapple with the implications of a massive virtual economy. The video game company Valve hired a well-known scholar, Yanis Varoufakis, as its economist-in-residence in 2012. A few years later, he went on to become Greece\u2019s Minister of Finance.\n\nThe space simulation game \"Eve Online\" also employed an economist to navigate such concepts as money supply and mineral distribution across its more than 7,000 virtual solar systems.\n\nThe game, with 300,000 players, had one of the industry\u2019s more dramatic showdowns over microtransactions. In 2011, gamers who were angry that their finely-tuned meritocracy would potentially be undermined by those who were able to purchase advantages over others with real dollars staged an online riot by occupying a trading station in the game and firing nonstop on a statue. The riot ended when the game's developers agreed to hedge any microtransactions that might give a paying player an advantage.\n\nHilmar Petursson, the CEO of \"Eve Online\" parent company, Iceland-based CCP games, called it \"our Occupy Wall Street moment.\" Instead of microtransactions, his company recoups revenue in part through subscriptions and a tax on players trading with each other. The statue that players shot up remains destroyed as a virtual \u201cmonument,\u201d as Petursson describes it, to a seminal event in the game\u2019s history.\n\nPetursson said it appeared that the creators of \"Red Dead Online\" are dealing with similar growing pains. But while he handled his insurgency in the relative obscurity of a gaming niche, the critical acclaim surrounding \"Red Dead Redemption 2\" and its online expansion means \u201cthey are obviously doing it on a very large stage.\"\n\nRockstar\u2019s concessions on Thursday afternoon ensured that, at least for now, there will be no riots in the virtual streets of Valentine.\n\nAmong its fixes was, for those who had played the online beta version up to that point, a \u201cgift\u201d of $250 in game dollars and 15 gold bars. After Rockstar made the announcement, Anas \u2013 the Canadian man moonlighting online as a deadly redhaired outdoorswoman \u2013 logged back on to check out his cut of that economic stimulus package. Including a partial refund for money he had spent on a rifle and bow, he had $260 newly deposited in his virtual bank account.\n\nAdjustments being made today include increasing cash and gold payments across a number of different activities, reducing the prices of most weapons in the Catalogue and Gunsmiths and balancing values of pelts, skins and fish. pic.twitter.com/IBO6bsfI77 \u2014 Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) December 6, 2018\n\nAnas was happy with the bonus and the more balanced economy but skeptical that Rockstar wouldn\u2019t later on figure out how to coerce players to engage in microtransactions on the billion-dollar-plus scale seen in \"GTA Online.\" \u201cRight now it\u2019s sort of that public PR let\u2019s-sweep-this-under-the-rug thing,\u201d Anas said.\n\nHe also acknowledged, though, that he was at no point anywhere close to abandoning the online version of the game. He admitted he had come to enjoy joining a friend to track big game in the snow-covered mountains north of Valentine, even if they almost froze to death because they can't afford warm clothes.\n\nHe said, in a begrudging nod to Rockstar\u2019s acumen: \u201cWhen you find a point where the consumer complains but they still partake, it\u2019s like that perfect business point.\u201d\n\nMore: 'Super Smash Bros.

Elizabeth Keatinge has more. Buzz60\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nMy brain goes through the exact same exercise around 5 p.m. every Dec. 31. As I don my tuxedo for a night of revelry \u2013 OK, fine, I\u2019m usually in sweatpants settling in for a night of board games \u2013 I reflect back on the year that was.\n\nOf course I think about fun family moments such as vacations, birthday parties and youth soccer goals, but I\u2019m primarily evaluating numbers: Did we move forward or backward? And by how much?\n\nI don\u2019t raise these queries out of greed. Instead I\u2019m trying to determine whether or not I\u2019m a liar. That's because at the beginning of every year, I declare a series of goals that can be quantified. And by New Year's Eve, I've either delivered on those promises or not.\n\nThe primary categories I evaluate my progress against include college fund deposits, health savings account (HSA) deposits, 401(k) deposits, charitable contributions, and savings account balances.\n\nThis list has changed drastically over the years. I used to focus on investment account balances, but I realized that was a giant mistake. Yes, the balances will eventually fund my goals, but I can\u2019t control their variable nature, so I was finding myself focusing on something I couldn\u2019t control \u2013 a practice as pointless and frustrating as me trying to elegantly wrap holiday gifts. So if my investment balances fall because of some significant global or domestic event, I\u2019ve made the decision to not care.\n\nBut while those accounts may go backward through no fault of our own, if a savings account goes backward, it\u2019s generally our doing. Therefore, I am willing to set a particular deposit goal with a savings account.\n\nWith that as background, it\u2019s worth revisiting the elements of effective financial goal-setting, especially as we reach the end of the year.\n\nBe declarative and use numbers\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

More newsletters\n\nI prefer to start with the phrase \u201cI will.\u201d I like its declarative nature. It doesn\u2019t hedge the way \u201cI\u2019d like to\u201d does. \u201cI\u2019d like to have zero debt\u201d pales in comparison to \u201cI will have zero debt.\"\n\nFive thousand dollars in savings, $6,500 deposited in investment account or zero dollars in credit-card debt are all better than saying subjective words like less, full or more. \u201cI will have less debt\u201d or \u201cI will have more savings\u201d leave you way too much wiggle room.\n\nDates are vital too. If you don\u2019t use them, you have an idea, not a goal. \u201cI will have $5,000\u201d is monumentally different than \u201cI will have $5,000 by Dec. 31.\u201d\n\nWhat's the purpose?\n\nRecently I began describing what accomplishing a goal will allow me to do. For instance, \"I will have $12,000 in my emergency fund by Dec. 31, and it will allow me to focus on saving for a down payment on a home, going forward.\u201d\n\nI highly recommend you adopt this add-on. It leads you to what\u2019s next. There\u2019s no resting on your laurels or keeping your future at bay. The time wasted between goals is very valuable time, ripe with momentum. Use it.\n\nStart early\n\nI\u2019m pulling the trigger early this year. Primarily because something funny happened last year. Well, it wasn't so much funny as it was an exercise in advanced face-palming. I had inadvertently forgotten to make a deposit. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever tried to make money immediately appear in an investment account at 5:15 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve, but it\u2019s impossible. And just like that, I was a liar in 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s how effective goal-setting works. Your declaration either will be your reality on the predetermined date, or it won't. There\u2019s no kinda. There\u2019s no sorta. And almost doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t know whether or not you accomplished a goal, you didn\u2019t. This sentiment scares people away from goal-setting, but those frozen in fear will never experience the glory of consistently hitting well-structured and meaningful goals.\n\nAs you set goals for 2019 and beyond, force your own hand. Set up a scenario in which, in the end, you\u2019re either a liar or you aren\u2019t. It\u2019s better than not knowing.\n\nPeter Dunn is an author, speaker and radio host, and he has a free podcast: Million Dollar Plan. Have a question about money for Pete the Planner?

The average rate at New York City hotels is a whopping $254 a night, according to a recent Statista report \u2013 America\u2019s most expensive average nightly rate. With prices like that, visiting New York on a budget may seem impossible.\n\nBut pricey hotels aside, New York City is actually a surprisingly attractive destination for budget travelers, especially if you\u2019re willing to do a little advance planning. Read on to learn how to save money in New York City, including tips for dining on the cheap, getting discount tickets to Broadway shows, saving on public transportation and finding the city\u2019s best free attractions and events.\n\nPlanning a trip to New York on a budget\n\n1. Get out the map. Group the sights that you want to see by neighborhood, so that you visit one area of the city each day (for example, visit the Statue of Liberty and Wall Street one day, and Central Park and Times Square another day). This will make the most of your time and save you money on the subway, and on Uber and taxi rides.\n\n2. Expand your reach. Spend at least part of your trip exploring residential neighborhoods like NoHo, Tribeca and Greenwich Village rather than sticking to the tourist traps. You\u2019ll get to see the real New York without paying out the wazoo.\n\nHow to save money on New York City attractions\n\n3. Purchase a tourist pass. If you know you\u2019ll be packing a lot of popular attractions into your stay, you may be able to save with a city pass. The New York Pass gives you entry into dozens of attractions over a set number of days for one fixed price. Another option is CityPass, which includes admission to either three or six museums and sights, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Empire State Building, over nine days. Passes such as these not only save you money, but also let you skip the lines.\n\n4. Look for reduced admission. Check the websites of museums you plan to visit to find out whether they offer any free or reduced-price admission days. For example, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is free every Friday between 4 and 8 p.m. Some museums also offer coupons or discounts on their websites, so make sure to check before going.\n\n5. Take advantage of freebies. Some attractions are free all the time \u2013 including Central Park, where there are almost always street performers and musicians roaming around, and the High Line, a public park recently created from an old elevated rail line. The Downtown Boathouse offers free public kayaking programs.\n\n6. Stock up on coupons. For discounts on food, shopping, spas and attraction admissions, search discount sites like Groupon and LivingSocial. Those who know they\u2019ll be traveling to New York City can stock up on some good deals prior to visiting.\n\n7. Take the ferry. Skip the touristy (and pricey) harbor cruises and take the Staten Island Ferry instead for fantastic views of New York Harbor \u2013 it\u2019s free!\n\nHow to save on NYC shows and entertainment\n\n8. Find low-cost events. Travelers visiting New York on a budget should take advantage of the many free or inexpensive concerts, readings, art exhibits and other events happening all over the city on any given day. The only challenge is finding them. For a start, try the \u201cFree in NYC\u201d page of New York\u2019s official tourist board.\n\n9. Save on Broadway tickets. The popular TKTS booths are great places to check for discounted Broadway tickets, but they\u2019re not your only option. There are often even better deals to be had on discount ticket websites like BroadwayBox.com.\n\nMore: Broadway on a budget: 7 tips for snagging cheap tickets\n\n10. Go to the source. Theaters will often sell leftover tickets (for as little as $25) a couple of hours before shows at their respective box offices \u2013 but sometimes it\u2019s standing room only, or seats may not be together if you\u2019ve got a group. Some theaters may give discounts to seniors or students with ID; it never hurts to ask.\n\n11. Get a subscription. Theater lovers who visit New York regularly or are planning a lengthy trip should consider an Audience Extras membership. For a yearly fee, you get access to last-minute tickets for local shows and concerts that have empty seats to fill. Tickets are free, other than a small ticket service charge. The membership pays for itself after just a few shows.\n\nHow to save on New York transportation\n\n12. Buy a subway pass. If you\u2019re planning a longer trip to the city, it\u2019s often cost-efficient to buy subway passes that give you unlimited rides for a week or longer (depending, obviously, on how long you\u2019ll be in town). This is especially true if you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going because if you make a mistake and have to redirect, it may involve swiping your card several times more than you anticipated.\n\n13. Consider driving. If you\u2019re coming into the city with a group of people, it might actually be cheaper to take a car (though also more annoying). Say you pay $40 for parking, $15 for tolls and $10 for gas \u2013 it might be less than $30 x 4 for train tickets into the city. But be sure to weigh that against the convenience of taking the train.\n\n14. Plan your parking. If you do decide to drive into the city, print out coupons or a parking pass ahead of time that will allow you to park all day for a flat rate, rather than paying horrendous hourly fees. One good option is Icon Parking, which is well-known throughout the city and has several locations. On its website, you can enter the dates and times of your arrival and departure \u2013 give yourself a buffer of a couple of hours each way, in case you arrive early or get tied up and leave late \u2013 and choose your parking garage location using the map. It\u2019ll then give you a printable confirmation that guarantees your flat rate for that time frame. You can either pay in advance online or get a coupon to bring to the site.\n\n15. Use your feet. Manhattan is very walkable and you\u2019ll see a lot more on foot than you would by public transport or taxi. Plus, it\u2019s free.\n\n16. Hop on a bike. Biking is a fun and inexpensive way to get around the city \u2013 just be sure to wear a helmet and stick to bike lanes for safety. There are some wonderful cycle routes around Manhattan, especially along the Hudson and East rivers. New York has a bike-share program called Citi Bike; for a very small fee, you can borrow a bike for anywhere from 30 minutes to three days.\n\nHow to save on meals in New York City\n\n17. Follow the young folks. If upscale lounges and fancy restaurants aren\u2019t your thing, skip the touristy Times Square area and eat where the students eat. Neighborhoods with colleges and universities \u2013 such as the East Village near New York University \u2013 often have unique local eats at fantastic prices.\n\n18. Hit the streets. In a city renowned for its street food, you\u2019re missing out if you eat all your meals in restaurants. From familiar hot dog carts to trucks bearing every kind of ethnic fare you can imagine, you can eat your way around the globe without ever leaving the Big Apple \u2013 or paying more than a few bucks at a time. A thorough site called New York Street Food highlights some of the best options.\n\n19. Explore ethnic neighborhoods. Areas like Chinatown, Little Italy and Little India are a great bet for authentic meals at affordable prices. One of my favorite dining experiences is to get up early on a Sunday and head to Chinatown for dim sum. Locals far outnumber tourists in the busy restaurants there, which offer small tapas-style plates for just a few dollars each.\n\n20. Don\u2019t worry, be happy. To save money at the bar, go out early and take advantage of happy hour prices and less crowded venues.\n\nWhere to stay in New York on a budget\n\n21. Stay outside Manhattan. Thanks to New York\u2019s comprehensive public transportation system, there\u2019s no need to pay through the nose for a Midtown hotel when you can stay in one of the other boroughs \u2013 or in New Jersey \u2013 and take the train wherever you want to go. Even after factoring in the cost of extra transportation, the savings can be significant.\n\n22. Consider alternatives. There are plenty of other options besides hotels, including apartment rentals, home exchanges, couch surfing and hostels, many of which offer private rooms in addition to shared dorms. For more ideas, see \"Ditch the hotel: 10 cheaper ways to stay.\" (Note that rentals through Airbnb and other vacation rental sites are not always legal in New York City; to protect yourself, read \"Airbnb and beyond: Tips for safe, legal vacation rentals.\")\n\n23. Share a bathroom. If you\u2019re willing to sacrifice a little comfort for a better location, consider staying in a hotel or an inn with a shared bath \u2013 it\u2019s often one of the best ways to find a truly budget rate in the most popular Manhattan neighborhoods.\n\nShopping in New York on a Budget\n\n24. Hit the flea markets. Spend your Saturday or Sunday shopping (and haggling) at one of the city\u2019s flea markets, where you\u2019ll always find something unique. Consider GreenFlea in Manhattan or Brooklyn Flea.\n\n25. Shop in the right spot. If you\u2019re looking for great deals on purses or jewelry, skip the street corner vendors and head to Canal Street, where you\u2019ll find bargain basement prices.\n\nThis story originally appeared on SmarterTravel.com.\n\nMore from SmarterTravel:\n\n11 cheap hotels in New York City\n\n11 deliciously cheap eats in New York City\n\nWhat to wear in New York City\n\nCarrie Gonzalez, Ashley Kosciolek, Shayne Rodriguez Thompson, Dan Askin, Carolyn Spencer Brown, John Deiner, and Erica Silverstein contributed to this story.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/02/21/new-york-deals/2933911002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2019/02/21/southwest-airlines-400-thursday-flights-canceled-maintenance-weather-las-vegas-snow/2938518002/", "text": "CLOSE You see all kinds of things on the Las Vegas Strip, but you rarely see this. USA TODAY\n\nSouthwest Airlines' flight woes continue, with nearly 400 Thursday flights canceled due to maintenance issues and winter weather.\n\nSouthwest, the nation's largest domestic carrier, had canceled 389 flights, or 9 percent of its schedule, as of 1:15 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. That is the highest number of cancellations by any carrier and accounts for 51 percent of flight cancellations within, into or out of the United States, according to FlightAware.\n\nSouthwest attributed the high number of cancellations to weather challenges and continuing maintenance issues that have a pulled a higher-than-usual number of aircraft out of service. Southwest did not detail how many of Thursday's cancellations were due to maintenance and how many were due to weather. On Tuesday, the airline said about half of its nearly 200 cancellations were due to maintenance issues.\n\nSouthwest canceled 255 Thursday flights into and out of Las Vegas, a desert city that has seen snow this week. Southwest has one of it busiest operations in Las Vegas, with nearly 225 daily departures from McCarran International Airport.\n\nSnow, rain and cloud cover are affecting air traffic in and out of @LASairport airport this morning, with many cancellations and delays.

The airline declared an operational emergency covering four major maintenance hubs, including Las Vegas, on Feb. 15 amid a long-running labor dispute with its mechanics. It added another city, Dallas, to the emergency status on Tuesday. The airline has ordered all maintenance hands on deck to get planes back in service and said mechanics who call in sick will need a doctor's note.\n\nTensions on that front escalated this week when Southwest Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven blamed the problem on the union representing Southwest's 2,400 mechanics, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. The group has been in negotiations with Southwest for a new contract since 2012. A tentative agreement was rejected by union members last fall.\n\n\"Southwest Airlines scapegoating of its expert aircraft maintenance technicians does not bode well for the airline\u2019s safe operations,'' Bret Oestreich, national director of AMFA, said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Safety is, and always will be, our number one priority.''\n\nPassengers aren't happy with the ongoing issues from normally reliable Southwest.\n\nIt looks like your flight was canceled due to a mechanical issue.

Spinning carousels with their majestic prancing steeds and lively band organs project auras of charm and nostalgia. Towering Ferris wheels, bathed in colored lights, sparkle against night skies.\n\nBumper cars, however, are housed inside buildings away from the tumult of the midway and typically get lost in the shuffle. The ride may not have the panache of other classics, but bumper cars have been essential attractions from the earliest days of amusement parks to the present. Getting behind the wheel of one is a rite of passage. No visit to a park is complete without landing a good ka-thunk or two.\n\nOne of the first bumper car rides may have been the Witching Waves at Coney Island\u2019s Luna Park, according to Charles Denson of the Coney Island History Project. The attraction debuted at the New York amusement mecca in 1907 in a large outdoor oval along the Bowery. The cars were not powered by electricity, but relied on an undulating floor to propel the low-slung vehicles, which passengers steered using levers.\n\nThere were other attempts at one-off attractions, but the bumper cars that we know today can be traced back about 100 years ago to the Dodgem Corp. in Lawrence, Massachusetts. They included long contact poles that scraped along an electrified grid ceiling and transferred power to the cars. The distinctive poles remain to this day on many bumper car attractions, and the occasional arcing sparks they generate and the smell of ozone they produce are among the ride\u2019s idiosyncrasies. Some bumper cars forego the poles and draw power from floor pickups.\n\nUnlike the precision rack-and-pinion steering found on modern automobiles, the wheels on the original Dodgems were more aspirational in nature. \"The early cars were kinda clunky,\u201d says Jim Futrell, historian for the National Amusement Park Historical Association. \u201cIf you turned the wheel to the left, it might go right and vice-versa.\u201d (Futrell should know a thing or two about the ride since he has a vintage bumper car in his basement.) The balky steering probably made the experience, where the goal has always been to bump other cars and dodge the cars trying to bump you, simultaneously frustrating and giddy.\n\nAs the rides evolved, the steering improved. But one of the attraction\u2019s peculiarities has been the cars\u2019 ability to go backward. It\u2019s often a requirement to get out of a multicar pile-up or to free a car that gets pinned into a corner. The cars don\u2019t have gearshifts, but drivers can go in reverse by turning the steering wheel 180 degrees, which faces the front wheels backwards.\n\nThe Dodgem Corp. installed its first bumper car attraction a few miles away from its shop at Salisbury Beach in Massachusetts in the early 1920s. (As with most seaside amusement areas, the Dodgem as well as most of the other rides and attractions at the beach are gone.) In the late 1920s, the Lusse Brothers, a shop in Philadelphia, developed its own version of bumper cars, which it called Auto Skooters. Throughout the 1920s, the two competing companies sold hundreds of bumper cars. The ride quickly became a staple at the many parks that used to dot the country, such as Euclid Beach in Cleveland, which closed in 1969.\n\nNearly 100 years after they were introduced, the rides are still going strong. What accounts for their enduring popularity? \u201cBumper cars epitomize the fundamental appeal of amusement parks: a sense of escape,\u201d Futrell theorizes. \u201cYou can do things you can\u2019t get away with in real life.\u201d For example, rather then fantasizing about road rage, the whole purpose of the ride is to smash into other vehicles. The only caveat is to avoid head-on collisions, as many bumper car attractions warn riders with large signs.\n\nAnother huge selling point: Kids can drive them. For many children, their first experience behind a wheel is plowing into other kids in bumper cars. Even when they can\u2019t reach the pedals, kids love hopping into a car alongside a parent or older sibling and commandeering the wheel.\n\nThe amusements used to sprawl across a much larger swath of Coney Island than they do today. Denson, who grew up in the shadows of the area\u2019s many roller coasters, recalls that there used to be at least six bumper car rides. He remembers the skill it sometimes took to operate them.\n\n\u201cThe best job in Coney was the one where you broke apart tangled bumper cars while the ride was in motion,\u201d Denson says. Attendants would stand on the bumper that surrounds a car, hold on to the contact pole with one hand and the steering wheel of the occupied vehicle with the other, and try to get the car in motion while other cars were slamming into it. \u201cOne false step and you could lose your foot,\u201d he adds.\n\nToday, Deno\u2019s Wonder Wheel Park features bumper cars that were relocated from nearby Astroland, a Coney Island park that closed in 2008. One of the oddest bumper car attractions is Eldorado Auto Skooter on Surf Avenue in Coney Island, which dates back to 1973. Inside visitors might be surprised to discover a Studio 54 vibe with glitter balls, pulsing lights and bass-thumping music. The Eldorado gives a whole new meaning to the disco classic \u201cDo the Bump.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgem Corp. sold its business in 1961, and subsequent owners stopped making the rides in 1970. Lusse continued manufacturing its Skooters until it closed in 1994. Today, overseas shops produce bumper cars, and the rides continue to delight visitors at parks as well as at fairs and carnivals. Knott's Berry Farm in California, for example, calls its attraction Wheeler Dealer Bumper Cars.\n\nIdlewild, a charming park in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, that dates back to 1878 and is geared to families with younger children, has offered bumper cars since 1931. The attraction used to feature Lusse Auto Skooters, but now offers cars produced by a French company.\n\nSome older bumper cars remain, however. The tiny Interstate Amusement in Seaside, Oregon, for instance, maintains a fleet of sharp-looking Lusse cars.\n\nOne of the best collections of vintage bumper cars is at Knoebels in Elysburg, Pennsylvania. The free-admission amusement park, which dates back to 1926, began offering Dodgem bumper cars in 1947. It switched to Lusse Auto Skooters and has stuck with them ever since.\n\nSince Lusse ceased operations 25 years ago, that presents some challenges, according to John Fetterman, a member of the maintenance team at Knoebels. \u201cOut of necessity, we have to source spare parts for the ride largely on our own,\u201d he says. In fact, Knoebels bought Idlewild\u2019s Lusse Auto Skooters when that park no longer needed them.\n\nIt takes a lot of tender loving care to keep the cars running, especially since their raison d'etre is to crash on a routine basis. In the offseason, Knoebels repaints and repairs the vehicles. It might seem to make more sense to purchase new ones, but Fetterman says the maxim \u201cnewer is not always better\u201d holds true. The park prefers the mid-century steel-bodied Lusse cars over the company\u2019s later fiberglass models.\n\nIn part, it has to do with aesthetics. The sleek, evocative cars that Knoebels has represent \u201cthe pinnacle of Lusse designs,\u201d Fetterman says. \u201cThey somewhat resemble the popular, Harley-Earl designed Chevrolet line of automobiles of that period.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2019/02/21/bumper-cars-history/2843129002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2019/02/20/forbes-21-new-five-star-hotels-added-annual-ratings-list/2907459002/", "text": "Forbes Travel Guide released its 61st annual list of Star Rating winners Wednesday, with 21 new Five-Star hotels added to the list.\n\nLondon now has the most Five-Star hotels, stealing the spot from Macau, China.

Since ancient times, residents and visitors in Bath, England, have been taking a dip in its restorative (and once-believed sacred) waters.\n\nBath is a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of those Roman baths, and also because of its honey-colored classic Georgian architecture \u2013 some of which is quite mysterious.\n\nThe Roman Baths\n\nThe Roman Baths are one of the best-preserved ancient religious spas in the world.\n\nToday it's a museum, carefully constructed over, around and within the ancient bath complex and temple. Originally the site was simply a natural hot spring, and those warm waters still bubble up and fill the baths today. But ancient peoples believed these waters to be magical, and it became a place to worship the gods \u2013 one particular goddess, in fact, named Sulis Minerva. You can see images of her, as well as remnants of her temple, today at the museum.\n\nYou can also see what the Victorians did to spruce the place up a bit after it was re-discovered centuries later. It\u2019s amazing to see the rough stone of the ancient Roman bath complex \u2013 which historians believe was built around A.D. 70. \u2013 with the more refined and elegant Victorian architecture built directly on top of it.\n\nIt is also incredible to get to walk through and touch all this history in one place. Just don\u2019t jump into the steaming pools, as tempting as it may be. Those are closed to the public.\n\nBut you can see hundreds of artifacts discovered within the baths, including letters to Sulis Minerva. The letters were written to the goddess and then dropped into the waters, which the ancient Romans believed were a sort of portal of communication with the gods. The subjects of the letters ranged from praising Sulis Minerva, to asking for money, to asking for punishment of another Roman. Kind of an interesting Dear Santa list, right?\n\nBath\u2019s mysterious architecture\n\nAfter the Roman Baths, take a tour of Bath\u2019s gorgeous Georgian architecture. You\u2019ll notice right away that everything is homogeneous: the style, the color of the stone, the symmetry of the streets and building heights. All that is intentional. Just like Paris, Bath is a planned city, and what a beauty it is.\n\nThere are three major architectural landmarks in Bath, either designed by or inspired by the same architect: John Wood the Elder (1704 - 1754). He was a Freemason, with some pretty peculiar inspirations for his works.\n\nThe first landmark is the Circus, which is basically a really fancy roundabout surrounded by lovely townhouses. There are three main theories about its design. One: When viewed from above, combined with the nearby Queen Square and adjoining street, it forms the shape of a key, an important Masonic symbol. Two: When combined with the nearby Royal Crescent, also viewed from above, the two symbolize the sun and the moon. And three (my favorite): The size and shape are a tribute to Stonehenge, because John Wood the Elder strongly believed that the Druids lived and worshiped here in Bath centuries ago.\n\nEven above the doorways of the townhouses, there are mysterious symbols of serpents, books, flowers and tools. And there\u2019s one more mysterious element to this Stonehenge-like bit of architecture: If you stand in the exact center, you get some interesting acoustics: a sort of part-echo, part-whisper that can be heard clearly. Who knew a traffic circle could be so fascinating?\n\nNext is the nearby Queen Square, with an obelisk in the center. Also designed by John Wood the Elder, it marked the beginning of the new town. It also is surrounded by elegant townhouses built with that same honey-colored limestone. Jane Austen famously stayed in one of those townhouses, and the square was later dedicated to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe last is the most recognizable Bath landmark: the Royal Crescent, designed by John Wood the Younger. It has to be seen in person for its design and scale to be truly appreciated. At 500 feet long, it bends and forms a perfect half-moon, or crescent, shape. It also is made up of elegant Georgian townhouses. And these lucky residents get their own green space too: The Crescent forever cradles the gorgeous Victoria Park. It was all designed this way so that the upper class could have a bit of the countryside in the big city. Lucky chaps.\n\nMore Bath sights\n\nThere\u2019s still much more to see and do in Bath. Don\u2019t miss: Bath Abbey, where the first King of England was crowned; Pulteney Bridge, modeled after Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio; and the Jane Austen Centre (snap a photo with its cheerful greeter, Martin Salter, known as \u201cthe most photographed man in England\u201d). Finally, take a much-deserved break at the Coeur de Lion, touted as the smallest pub in Bath. Just be prepared to get snuggly as you sip your ale with the Bathonians there. Maybe they can decode all the mysterious symbols of their beautiful city.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/02/20/bath-england-roman-baths/2919552002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/02/18/rick-steves-paris-france-attractions/2906187002/", "text": "France has a rich history, an impressive infrastructure and a tourism industry trying valiantly to cope with its big crowds. Travelers who plan ahead enjoy big rewards.\n\nParis' most famous landmark, the Eiffel Tower, has a new look. A glass wall now rings its base for security reasons, with one access point at each side, meaning you can no longer wander freely under the tower. Visitors should allow an extra 30 minutes to go through screening. Also, summit tickets for the top are no longer available on the second level of the tower; it's smart to buy them online in advance.\n\nMore: Rick Steves: Tips for visiting the Eiffel Tower\n\nParis continues to upgrade its many marvelous exhibits. The Cluny Museum, with its famous \"The Lady and the Unicorn\" tapestries, is undergoing a multiyear, room-by-room renovation. Expect some changes and room closures until at least 2020.\n\nThe Parisian transportation system is also getting some improvements. After a century of paper tickets for the M\u00e9tro and buses, smartcards are slowly taking over, including the Navigo Easy Pass, which is better for travelers, as it can be shared and topped up.\n\nAt the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, timed-entry tickets are now required for the tower climb, even if you have a Paris Museum Pass. Reservations are available only on the same day (starting at 7:30 a.m.) on the JeFile app or at ticket machines on-site. Another Paris landmark, the towering, modern La Grande Arche de La D\u00e9fense, has reopened, allowing visitors to take an elevator to the top. While it's pricey, and you can enjoy better views elsewhere, just visiting the La D\u00e9fense district gets you into a fascinating slice of Paris that most tourists miss.\n\nA new trend in Paris dining is \"bus restaurants.\" Diners listen to soft jazz as they glide along Paris' most famous boulevards on an elegant double-decker bus. For about the same price as a dinner cruise in a boat on the Seine, you can dine for two hours with Paris rolling by outside your window.\n\nNorthwest of Paris, the towns of Normandy are getting ready to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings on June 6. Throngs of visitors will make this a difficult time to be there, and accommodations near the beaches are already booked up. Fortunately, in high season guided tours in English will be offered for free (or very cheap) at the following key WWII stops: Arromanches, Longues-sur-Mer, American Cemetery at Omaha Beach, Pointe du Hoc, Utah Beach Landing Museum and Juno Beach Centre.\n\nI love France's high-speed rail system, and now it's better than ever. With the completion of a high-speed line to the city of Rennes, the trip from Paris to the spectacular island monastery of Mont Saint-Michel now takes only three hours: about two hours on the train to Rennes and then an hour on a railway-run bus, which drops you right at the island's main gate.\n\nThere's also some good news for ch\u00e2teau lovers: Construction work is finally complete at the Loire Valley's Ch\u00e2teau d'Azay-le-Rideau, which is set on a romantic reflecting pond, with a fairy-tale facade and beautifully furnished rooms.\n\nAfter several years of being covered in scaffolding, the Ch\u00e2teau d'Azay-le-Rideau has returned to its romantic glory. (Photo: Rick Steves)\n\nLike other popular destinations, France is dealing with the damaging effects of heavy tourism. In the Dordogne, the Grotte de Font-de-Gaume prehistoric cave \u2014 one of the only caves in France where you can see original drawings, not replicas \u2014 no longer accepts reservations, making it next to impossible to get in.

And that leaves you more time and money to enjoy the many attractions \u2014 historic, scenic, edible and drinkable \u2014 that make France such a rewarding place to experience.\n\nRick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.

The new terminal will replace the existing \u201clandside\u201d building, essentially filling in an empty area that currently exists between the gate areas and the airport\u2019s entrance.\n\nDeparting passengers will go through the new terminal\u2019s upper level while arriving passengers will move through the lower level as they make their way from their gates to baggage claim and the airport\u2019s exit.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Pittsburgh to be first airport to allow non-fliers past security since 9/11\n\nThe airport released images of the new plan, but said it will \u201ccontinue to be refined over the next phase of the project \u2026, which is expected to run through summer 2019.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a major makeover for the airport, which was revolutionary when it opened in 1992. Since then, however, Pittsburgh International has become suboptimal for the city\u2019s modern-day needs.\n\nThe current design was built almost exclusively to specifications called for by US Airways, which at the time used Pittsburgh as a major connecting hub that ranked among the nation\u2019s busiest. The airport\u2019s four passenger concourses were laid out like an \u201cX,\u201d giving connecting fliers a relatively short walk between gates \u2013 no matter which concourse they arrived to and departed from.\n\nARCHIVES: Tears, tales and champagne flow on US Airways' last-ever flight (story continues below)\n\nAt the center of the \u201cX\u201d was the Airmall, a mall-like operation in the airside terminal. It offered robust food and retail options and promised \u201cstreet pricing.\u201d Though the concept has been widely emulated since, it was an untested concept for U.S. airports when it debuted in 1992. The new terminal proved popular among flyers, both local and connecting.\n\nBut US Airways \u2013 now part of American Airlines \u2013 ran into financial turbulence from the late 1990s into the 2000s, undergoing multiple bankruptcies amid a prolonged struggle to survive. In 2004, US Airways formally \u201cde-hubbed\u201d Pittsburgh, the first move in its decade-long downsizing there that pared hundreds of flights from the airport\u2019s schedule.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: British Airways coming to Pittsburgh, will fly to London Heathrow\n\nA steep decline in passenger numbers followed, leading to difficult times for the airport. Officials there even went so far as to wall off the ends of some of the concourses as passenger counts dwindled, allowing the airport to save money by shutting off utilities at the shuttered gate areas.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s airport has found new life this decade, transitioning from the hub it once was to an airport now focused on \u201clocal\u201d traffic specifically flying to or from Pittsburgh itself.\n\nLow-cost carriers Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant have expanded to Pittsburgh while Southwest has grown its presence there. Other new carriers include Alaska Airlines, which now flies nonstop to Seattle.\n\nThe airport also has benefited from the leadership of ambitious new CEO Christina Cassotis, who\u2019s managed to return some swagger to the airport.\n\nNow, the new terminal would continue Pittsburgh\u2019s momentum as the airport shifts from a hub to one focused on local passengers.\n\n\u201cWe want to build a Pittsburgh airport. We\u2019ve seen what a US Airways airport looks like,\u201d Cassotis told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the new plans were unveiled.\n\n\u201cThis is really the last piece of the puzzle for Pittsburgh\u2019s renaissance,\u201d she added to the paper, which ran its story under an online headline reading: \"A US Airways airport no more?

Why Airbus' bet on 'superjumbo' jets failed\n\nIt\u2019s official: Airbus will pull the plug on its A380 double-decker jet.\n\nThe move was announced Thursday, and comes after much speculation about the future of Airbus\u2019 \u201csuperjumbo\u201d jet amid tepid sales.\n\nThe latest A380 is now expected to roll off the assembly line in 2021. With that, there will be no new A380s beyond then, though it's possible many of the A380s now flying will continue to do so for a decade or more.\n\nThe A380 is the world\u2019s largest commercial passenger jet, capable of sitting 600 passengers or more. It marked a bold and ambitious project for Airbus, which bet airlines would want a giant plane that could fly more passengers into busy airports with no capacity for new flights.\n\nAround the same time, Boeing made a contrary bet. Instead of a double-decked behemoth, the U.S. jetmaker figured its airline customers would be better served by a smaller widebody jet with low operating costs that could instead make frequent flights between cities. Or open up international routes between medium-sized markets too small to serve with larger widebody jets.\n\nARCHIVES: Emirates pushes A380 seating capacity past 600\n\nBoeing\u2019s Dreamliner, made partially from composite materials, began flying for airlines in 2011. Boeing has now received more than 1,400 orders for the jet, which remains a strong seller for the company. And, as Boeing predicted, it opened up new overseas routes from cities like Austin and New Orleans. Even Charleston, South Carolina, will soon have a new nonstop flight to London that will be operated by British Airways on Boeing Dreamliners.\n\nAirbus\u2019 later A350, a smaller widebody model also made partially from composite materials, followed Boeing\u2019s 787, flying its first passenger flight in 2015. That line also has sold well for Airbus.\n\nBut the A380 never found a profitable niche.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Emirates airline shows off its Airbus A380 at Washington Dulles (story continues below)\n\nThe A380 seats more than 500 passengers in a standard seat configuration, though some airlines have versions that seat more than 600. The A380 could seat as many as 850 passengers in an all-economy class layout, though no airline has yet to do so.\n\nWhile the A380 can carry more passengers than any other commercial passenger plane, the four-engine aircraft also is more expensive to operate compared to modern two-engine jets. For example, Boeing's two-engine 777 models are cheaper to operate and can seat nearly 400 passengers.\n\nThe A380 also required some airports to modify taxiways and airport terminals to be able to accommodate the giant jet.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: For airlines, two engines are better than four\n\nEven Boeing's iconic humped 747, its closest in capacity to the A380, has seen sales decline as passenger airlines increasingly prefer two-engine models that are less costly to operate.\n\n\"The very clear trend in the market is to operate long-haul aircraft with two engines [such as] Boeing's 787 and 777, and Airbus's A330 and A350,\" Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flight Global, says to the BBC.\n\nThe A380 began flying for airlines just in 2007, when Singapore Airlines put the jet into passenger service.\n\nDubai-based carrier Emirates was an enthusiastic supporter of the jet, ordering nearly half of all the roughly 270 A380s Airbus is expected to have made before the line ends.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Swivel chairs, double beds, 32\" TVs: Check out Singapore Air's swanky new 'suites'\n\nBeyond Emirates, however, the A380 never found the broad customer base Airbus envisioned.\n\nNo U.S. carriers ever gave serious consideration to ordering the jet. About a dozen other global airlines bought the jet, including Air France, British Airways, Korean Air, Lufthansa and Qantas, among others. But, aside from Emirates, the A380 was just a niche player in the fleets of most airlines to fly it.\n\nFor many of the A380\u2019s current operators, the giant jet served as a canvas to create some of the most opulent passenger seats ever.\n\nSingapore Airlines, already regarded as one of the world\u2019s most luxurious carriers, used the A380 to roll out its spacious suites with private sliding doors and separate bed and siting areas. Emirates, along with United Arab Emirates rival Etihad, added showers to their versions of the jet.\n\nNow, though, the line will soon come to an end.\n\nSome will view the Aribus' move as a validation for Boeing\u2019s focus on its Dreamliner. And, for Airbus, the short-lived run of its signature A380 product will be viewed as an embarrassing miscalculation. The Associated Press notes that \u201ca pall of mourning hung in the atmosphere Thursday at (the Airbus) headquarters in the southern French city of Toulouse \u2014 but there was also a hint of relief after years of straining to keep the A380 alive.\"\n\n\"It's a painful decision for us,\" CEO Tom Enders said. \"We've invested a lot of effort, a lot of resources, a lot of sweat ... but we need to be realistic.\"\n\nAn Airbus A380 painted in the jetmaker's signature color scheme flies at the Farnborough Air Show in England on July 15, 2014.

There's no denying that the cruising industry contributes to water, air and marine-noise pollution \u2013 but technology and consumer pressure are helping a bit. Environmental responsibility is such a hot topic that all the large cruise lines have website sections where you can evaluate their efforts. (Of course, this info is also intended to help market their cruises.)\n\nAnd what about the impact on local economies and communities? Cruising can trample towns with sightseers who leave almost no money (since they eat, sleep and buy their tours on board). On the other hand, most of those communities view cruise ships as an economic boost \u2013 which explains why so many ports are investing in cruise-worthy piers and terminals.\n\nConscientious travelers also want to consider issues of economic justice. Critics point out that the industry is built on rich tourists being served by crew members from poor countries. But I've talked to many people who work on cruise ships, and they've told me that the income they earn on a ship is far more than any employment prospects they have back home. And the remarkable loyalty of numerous crew members (working many, many years for the same cruise line) says a lot about this working arrangement.\n\nThere's also diversity to this style of travel. Cruising can accommodate a family with vastly different travel philosophies. It's possible for Mom to go to the museum, Dad to lie by the pool, Sally to go snorkeling, Bobby to go shopping, Grandma and Grandpa to take in a show ... and then all of them can have dinner together and swap stories about their perfect days. (Or, if they're really getting on each other's nerves, there's plenty of room on a big ship to spread out.)\n\nCruising is especially popular among retirees, particularly those with limited mobility. Cruising rescues you from packing up your bags and huffing to the train station every other day. Once on land, accessibility for wheelchairs and walkers can vary dramatically \u2013 though most cruise lines offer excursions specifically designed for those who don't get around well.\n\nAnd yet, I still have reservations. Just as people trying to learn a language will do better by immersing themselves in that culture than by sitting in a classroom for a few hours, I believe that travelers in search of engaging, broadening experiences should eat, sleep and live Europe. Good or bad, cruising insulates you from Europe. If the taxi drivers in Naples are getting a little too pushy, you can simply retreat to the comfort of 24-hour room service, American sports on the TV, and a boatload of people who speak English. It's fun \u2013 but is it Europe?\n\nCruise staff prepare quality dishes that would cost a pretty penny in a top-end restaurant - but the food still pales compared with meals you can get in port, lovingly prepared with local recipes. (Photo: Trish Feaster)\n\nCruising might not be for everyone. But neither is my style of travel. And at least cruising gets people (who might otherwise stay home) out interacting with the world. Many of the people I met on my last cruise were enjoying (and benefiting from) the chance to broaden their perspective through travel ... even if tethered to a big floating chunk of America.\n\nLet's face it: Americans have the shortest vacations in the rich world. Some choose to dedicate their valuable time off to all-inclusive, resort-style vacations in Florida, Hawaii, the Caribbean or Mexico: swimming pools, song-and-dance shows, shopping and all-you-can-eat buffets. Cruising lets you toggle back and forth between the floating American-style resort each evening and a different European adventure each day. If you know how to use your time on shore smartly, it can be the best of both worlds.

United\u2019s policy covered Tuesday flights to 10 airports in the Great Plains and Wednesday flights to the others, which spanned from Minnesota and Wisconsin east to Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nSouthwest had two policies, one covering the \"Midwest\" and the other the \"Ohio Valley and Northeast.\" More than two dozen airports were included, with either Tuesday or Wednesday flights covered depending on the city.\n\nAmerican's waiver focused on the Northeast, covering 11 cities -- including its hubs at New York JFK and Washington Reagan National.\n\nJetBlue\u2019s waiver, also issued on Wednesday, covered Wednesday flights at six airports (Baltimore/Washington; Minneapolis/St. Paul; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Richmond, Virginia; and Washington Reagan National).\n\nAt Frontier, Wednesday customers flying from 24 airports from New York state to North Dakota and Nebraska were covered.\n\nThe policies varied by carrier, but -- generally -- they allowed customers to make one change to their itineraris without paying the standard change fee that can cost $200 or more.\n\nContributing: Dawn Gilbertson\n\nIN PICTURES: 32 cool aviation photos\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2019/02/19/winter-storm-airlines-waive-change-fees-cancel-flights-ahead-snow/2915925002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/hotels/2019/02/20/forbes-five-star-hotels/2910484002/", "text": "None\n\nForbes Travel Guide has named its Star Rating winners for 2019, with 21 new Five-Star hotels added to the list.

A derivative of the hemp plant, CBD is non-psychoactive (read: it can't get you high). It may make you feel relaxed, however, and is believed by certain health circles to help alleviate aches and pains.\n\nAll around the country (except New York City, Maine, and Ohio), chefs and bartenders are flexing their creative chops and infusing CBD into their craft. From doughnuts to ice cream to beer, here are 10 CBD-infused treats worth seeking out.\n\nGrapefruit-rosemary kombucha | Golda Kombucha\n\n\n\nAtlanta\n\nGolda Kombucha opened their taproom in 2018, making them Georgia's only kombucha brewery. Found on Atlanta's West End, right off the BeltLine trail, their fermented teas rotate seasonally and incorporate locally-sourced ingredients as much as possible.\n\nThe latest brew on their roster is grapefruit-rosemary featuring a CBD infusion. Kombucha is already believed to have wellness properties, such as serving as a digestion aid and offering liver support, so this CBD-infused brew packs an extra punch.\n\nWhile you're there, check out the taproom's other offerings like fermented vegan cheese by Pure Abundance, which is created on site.\n\nApothecary cocktail | Haberdish\n\n\n\nCharlotte\n\nSip the refreshing Apothecary cocktail with gin and prickly pear liquor \u2014 Photo courtesy of Haberdish\n\nHaberdish in Charlotte specializes in southern eats, and is especially beloved for their sweet potato dumplings and chicken tenders. While the food skews traditional, the drink program, helmed by Colleen Hughes, is decidedly modern.\n\nHughes concocted a refreshing CBD cocktail using Durham Distillery gin, which happens to be one of the few woman-owned distilleries in the United States. The drink blends CBD concentrate, prickly pear liquor, Cocchi Americano, ginseng, bitter melon, ginger reduction and lime.\n\nEvergreen Buddy truffle | Monarch & the Milkweed\n\nBurlington, Vt.\n\nIf you're looking for heaven on Earth, it's at Monarch & the Milkweed in Burlington. Billing themselves as a \"fine diner\" with an emphasis on pastries, all-day brunch, coffee and cocktails, the eatery also packs plenty of charm.\n\nIn addition to their eats, they have a cannabis confection brand called Milkweed. Their most popular treat is the Evergreen Buddy: a dark chocolate truffle filled with 50 milligrams of CBD, Vermont pine, lemon and locally-sourced honey.\n\nMore: What is CBD? And why is the cannabis-derived ingredient on the rise for wellness products?\n\nCBD chocolate ice cream | Little Baby's\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nLittle Baby's in Philadelphia is known for its vibrant, eclectic decor that hearkens to the classic TV show, Saved by the Bell. Their flavor lineup includes traditional favorites, but it's their experimental flavors that make them stand out. Recently, they've added a CBD chocolate ice cream to the collection, and as an added bonus for those with dietary restrictions, it's completely vegan.\n\nSold only in pints, the dairy-free ice cream is made with a coconut milk base, agave nectar and contains 100 milligrams of full spectrum CBD oil (produced by local brand Bouquet CBD). Each pint is four servings and sold at their six scoop shops throughout Philly.\n\nChocolate birthday cake doughnut | Astro Doughnuts and Fried Chicken\n\nLos Angeles\n\nIt doesn't need to be your birthday to enjoy the CBD-infused birthday cake doughnut \u2014 Photo courtesy of Astro Doughnuts & Fried Chicken\n\nAfter making waves as a coupled doughnut and fried chicken shop in Washington D.C., Astro opened its downtown Los Angeles outpost in 2017. Already a hit on the east coast with its dual threat of fried chicken sandwiches and creative doughnuts in varieties like creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, chocolate corn flake and cherry blossom, Angelenos flocked to the west coast spot.\n\nNow, the L.A. location has something new to buzz about: the chocolate birthday cake doughnut topped with CBD-infused chocolate mint buttercream frosting and sprinkles. It'll also be available at the Santa Monica location opening soon.\n\nGeneral Washington's Secret Stash beer | Dad and Dude's Breweria\n\nAurora, Colo.\n\nThe original CBD-infused beer can be found at Dad and Dude's Breweria in Colorado. Run by father and son Thomas and Mason Hembree, Breweria first launched its CBD beer in 2015 but had to put production on hold when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration declared that marijuana derivatives like CBD are still Schedule 1 substances and therefore couldn't be sold across state lines.\n\nIn July 2018, after a legal battle with the federal government and the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, they began producing the beer again.\n\nThe IPA's name is a tribute to George Washington who, besides being our nation's first president, grew hemp for textile purposes. Medium-bodied with notes of citrus, each pint has 4.2 milligrams of CBD. You can buy it in cans or on tap at the brewery.\n\n10BEST These are the favorite chocolates of the best chocolate makers in the world 10BEST These are the favorite chocolates of the best chocolate makers in the world\n\nChocolate chip cookies | Warm Belly Bakery\n\nChicago\n\nWarm Belly's CBD Cookies are packed with chocolate chips \u2014 Photo courtesy of Warm Belly\n\nKnown for soft, chewy cookies that are the size of your fist, Chicago's Warm Belly Bakery has two locations in the city (West Loop and Lincoln Park).

Their coffee offerings are special, too, like the CBD-infused cold brew coffee.\n\nTheir specialty coffee is infused with 225 milligrams of hemp extract per eight ounces of coffee, which is then used for a refreshing cold brew drink. If cold brew makes you jittery, you'll find that this one is mellowed out by the CBD. More of a tea person? They also have a CBD chamomile.\n\nHoney latte | Herban Market\n\nFranklin, Tenn.\n\nAn organic grocery store with a cafe, Herban Market is found in Franklin, a Nashville suburb. At the shop, you'll find a selection of gourmet food products like wine, olive oils and body care. At their coffee bar, they offer a CBD-infsued honey latte. The dairy-free drink features hemp milk, espresso and honey infused with 25 milligrams of CBD.

Here are the events that led up to the \"Empire\" actor turning himself in. USA TODAY\n\nWhy did Smollett believe that his alleged plan would succeed? Because it was designed to fit a specific, well-established victimhood narrative.\n\nDays before the incident that made him infamous, accused hate-crime hoaxer Jussie Smollett tweeted out, \u201cFrauds are everywhere y\u2019all.\u201d In retrospect, this seems like either an ironic warning or a subconscious cry for help.\n\nWhy did Smollett believe that his alleged plan to manufacture outrage would succeed? Most probably because is was designed to fit a specific, well-established victimhood narrative. In this case, it was the young, gay, black celebrity versus the beastly, MAGA-preaching white racist homophobes. There is no ambiguity in that almost cartoonish scenario.\n\nThe props (the rope and the bleach) and Trump-implicating rhetoric were necessary to establish the supposed hate motive. Otherwise Smollett might have been viewed as just another Chicago crime victim. And it was important to tie the faux attack to the idea prevalent on the left that the advent of the Trump era has unleashed an unprecedent wave of violence against \u201cthe other.\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., helped push this idea when she tweeted out after the initial reports of the alleged assault that \u201cit is no one\u2019s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes.\u201d\n\n\"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett (Photo: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nFake news is a test for citizens. Here's how to pass it.\n\nCovington Catholic furor is a warning to end our dangerous social media mob mentality\n\nKirsten Powers: I'm not proud of role I\u2019ve played in toxic public debate. I plan to change.\n\nThat is true, but it is no one\u2019s job to exaggerate (or fake) hate crimes either. According to FBI statistics, there were 7,175 hate crimes in 2017, of which 28 percent were anti-black and 9 percent aimed at gay men.\n\nThat is up from the 6,121 reported hate crimes in 2016, but part of a growing trend that began in 2014, so it is hard to pin the blame on President Donald Trump.\n\nAlso, while even one hate crime is too many, they are not rampant compared with crime in general. In 2017 there were 788 aggravated assaults motivated by one form of bias or another out of an estimated 810,825 total aggravated assaults that year. And note that the overall number of assaults had also increased since 2016, which fits the general trend.\n\nSmollett 'could have created a race war'\n\nSmollett played the victim card to the hilt after the alleged hoax attack, telling fans at a performance in West Hollywood how he \u201cfought the f--- back\u201d against his attackers and bragging that he was \u201cthe gay Tupac,\u201d an exorbitant claim that rapper 50 Cent satirized in a scathing meme.\n\nSmollett\u2019s family called the incident an act of domestic terrorism. And on cue various figures in the press, punditry and politics launched into the usual overheated analyses of what the attack symbolized in Trump\u2019s America. Democratic presidential aspirants Kamala Harris and Corey Booker both amplified the victim narrative with ominous references to lynching, then sheepishly retreated when the affair turned out to be a case of fake noose.\n\nOne of the most preposterous quick takes appeared in GQ, which heatedly concluded that \u201cAmerica's choice to embrace the blind rage of late-stage whiteness in decline is an explicit longing for this kind of crime.\u201d\n\nThis article was tweeted out by Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who ironically warned that the \u201cdangerous lies spewing from the right wing is (sic) killing & hurting our people.\u201d\n\nThe dangerous lie was the one attributed to Smollett, whom black civil rights activist Najee Ali of Project Islamic HOPE said, \u201ccould have created a race war.\u201d\n\nSmollett expected the outrage he garnered\n\nOf course, Smollett would have expected righteous outrage to erupt in response to his alleged hoax crime. It would have been part of the marketing effort. CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, while acknowledging that it was \u201cnot cool\u201d for Smollett to lie, seemed to imply that the real issue was a failure on the accused felon\u2019s part to have an effective crisis public relations plan, referencing Smollett\u2019s softball interview on Good Morning America.\n\nNo, the real issue is how easily and quickly people latch on to hoaxes like the one attributed to Smollett, aiding and abetting the farce absent any solid evidence to support it.\n\nThis is not the only recent case of hoaxes or misreported victimization narratives. The potentially libelous coverage of the Covington Catholic High School kids at the Lincoln Memorial is one example. There was also a false allegation levied against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which many initially believed. Whether the hoaxes involve racial slurs, homophobic death threats, hijab grabbing, racially motivated vandalism, racist graffiti, church burning, or spray-painted swastikas, in every such case the perpetrator relies on the willingness or even eagerness of others to believe that this type of behavior credibly reflects a chronically sick and divided country.\n\nThis diminishes the experiences of the actual victims of bias crime in America, and gives a platform to those who want to sow division and discord. If Jussie Smollett is guilty of planning this elaborate hoax, then the hate crime was his alone.\n\nJames S.

It is criminal. It is unbelievable.\"\n\nAn online military family survey from Jan. 30 to Feb. 6 elicited more than 16,000 responses \u2014 hundreds poured in each hour \u2014 and 55 percent rated experience in privately managed base housing \"very negative\" or \"negative.\"\n\nThere's no inherent evil in privatizing government functions if it improves service and accountability.

USA TODAY\n\nDid Amazon stop needing New York, or did New York drive it away? As cities across America compete for jobs, the messy breakup is a cautionary tale.\n\nI ran economic development strategy for New York City during part of Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s tenure. And when New York was digging out of the 2007-08 financial crisis, I helped develop his economic growth plan that focused on technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nI\u2019m also a taxpayer and a voter.\n\nIn all of these roles, I can see a lot that went wrong in the wake of the messy breakup between Amazon and New York. Everyone wants jobs to come to their city or town. The Amazon saga holds many lessons and raises many questions, starting with this:\n\n\u25baWhy did Amazon deserve a discount? It costs lots of money to run a city, and taxes are how we pay for services like schools, police and fire. Most of Amazon\u2019s competitors and peers (Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Apple) came to New York and expanded without government tax breaks on the scale of what Amazon was offered.\n\nThe justification for giving Amazon a special deal was something like: It was a large, prestigious catch and would open part of Queens, a city borough across the East River from Manhattan, as an important new business district. But were the potentially $3 billion in incentives necessary? And what was New York\u2019s plan for handling other companies demanding similar deals going forward?\n\nAnti-Amazon protesters in Long Island City, Queens, on Nov. 14, 2018. (Photo: Bebeto Matthews, AP)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nAmazon played us: New York state senator\n\nLosing Amazon HQ2 brands New York as anti-business\n\nNew York's Amazon rejection exposes US opportunity gap\n\nAlso, the cost of living in Crystal City, Virginia, (the other HQ2 location, now the only one) is about the same as in Queens. But by most accounts, New York's package was much larger per worker than Virginia's. Were the New Yorkers just bad at negotiating, or did they have substantive reasons for their generosity? And did they know what was on offer from other cities?\n\n\u25baWhat\u2019s happening to those 25,000 jobs? Amazon has said that the 25,000 jobs proposed for New York aren\u2019t going to Crystal City, and that it is not reopening the search for a new location. After a multiyear site search, it seems odd to walk away at the first sign of trouble without announcing a Plan B.\n\nWas Amazon driven away by New York resistance, or did it conclude it no longer needed the space? The history of economic development tax incentives is littered with projects that were structured around a specific company and fell apart when the company\u2019s circumstances changed. A city or state should always plan for that contingency.\n\n\u25baBait-and-switch is a lousy economic development policy. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio wrote a column complaining about all the things Amazon could have done to avoid this debacle. Some of his points were valid, some less so. But if he wanted Amazon to commit, for example, to \u201cinvest in infrastructure and other community needs,\u201d that should have been part of the contract negotiations. Amazon was entitled to know those conditions upfront, not after the deal was announced.\n\nCompanies make business decisions based on profitability, not on good press for politicians. If you want a corporation to do something, it should be part of the business deal \u2014 not something you insist on afterwards.\n\n\u25baCelebrate the companies that pay full freight. At about the same time Amazon announced HQ2 in New York City, Google announced a New York City expansion involving a several billion dollar real estate purchase. It had enough space for more than 12,000 additional highly paid Google employees. And this was happening without tax subsidies.\n\nGoogle\u2019s type of growth was what New York should have been celebrating, loudly and proudly. Not the Amazon deal with its billions in tax breaks. To put this in private sector terms, if you\u2019re running an airline, would you want passengers paying full price or passengers getting a very large discount?\n\nAirlines offer discounts, and sometimes so should cities regarding taxes. But cities should never lose sight of which type of taxpayer is more valuable. As with an airline, try to be nicest to the taxpayers paying the full rate.\n\n\u25baNew York leaders should \"play offense.\" Former Oath and AOL CEO Tim Armstrong made that excellent suggestion to de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, advising them to send Requests for Proposals to the world\u2019s largest tech companies for what would have been the Amazon site. If they thought this was a good deal for New York, why not look for another tech giant to come to the city on similar or even less generous incentive terms?\n\nMore significant, why didn\u2019t they do that in the first place? Amazon should have been forced to compete against other companies for a package this size. Competition is how cities can make sure they get the best value for their incentive dollars.\n\nWhen the Bloomberg administration decided it wanted another top-tier engineering school, it took control. The city sent out Requests for Information, followed by Requests for Proposals, to the world\u2019s best universities. We presented what New York wanted and what the city would provide, and let the participants make proposals to us. The result was the Cornell-Tech campus on Roosevelt Island.\n\n\u25baA toxic political environment is a turnoff. My sense is at least some politicians criticizing the Amazon deal were play-acting. They assumed Amazon would make some meaningless concessions and they could claim them as victory (trust me, President Donald Trump learned his negotiating style in New York City).\n\nIt's best for governments to invest generally in education, basic research, infrastructure and other activities that benefit an industry cluster, and avoid picking individual corporate winners and losers. When incentives are appropriate, and sometimes they are, they need to be offered in a businesslike manner without melodrama.\n\nAs Amazon just showed everyone, corporations aren\u2019t interested in local politics or serving as the local political football.

He's also an ex-felon.\n\nWilcots was released from prison in 2007 after being charged with possession of illegal substances and violating his parole. A small mistake that's no secret to his followers, but which largely shapes the platform for his drag persona of Latrice Royale.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to talk about (our experiences), and laugh about it,\" says Wilcots, who was recently granted his voting rights again thanks to a state constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to more than 1 million ex-felons in Florida. A welcome change for someone who, while unable to vote, found that civic engagement was also a way to make his voice heard in our democracy.\n\nBut of course, no one goes to a drag show to hear about voting rights of felons, so how do you take advantage of a captive audience with political clout? You build your base and you share your story.\n\n\"I try to keep it light and fun. But there are important issues that we need to discuss. Around the world, around the globe, I speak to my experience,\" says the contestant of the RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 4. \"I share the details of what went down. From my demise to my success. And teach people that they can overcome obstacles. My audiences around the world know my life.\"\n\nThe restoration of Wilcots' voting rights comes at the nexus of political turmoil in our nation and high civic engagement. And a rise in hate crimes has minority communities looking to make their voices heard to ensure we don't regress as a society.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nToxic masculinity is aggravating tensions, so I spoke to Trixie Mattel about it\n\nCloseted LGBTQ youth should know the landscape before coming out\n\nAs a transgender woman, I can't fight Trump's policies by myself. I need all progressives to join us.\n\nWhen Wilcots couldn't exercise his right as an American, Latrice stepped up to be a vociferous advocate in the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"Ever since I knew I didn\u2019t have my rights to vote (after being released from prison) I wanted to motivate people to vote,\" Wilcots says. \"There's a lot we don't know. We need to make sure we are educating ourselves. Not resting on the thought that everyone will make it better for us. My experience with the younger generation is that that they're not paying attention.\"\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, millennial voter turnout increased to 49 percent in the 2016 presidential election from 46 percent in 2012. (Among black millennials, however, it slipped from 55 percent to 49 percent.) It's slow progress for a voting bloc that historically has had the lowest voter turnout, but progress nonetheless.\n\nTimothy Wilcots, known as Latrice Royale, Instagram post. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nWilcots stands at an impressive 6-foot-4 (add a few more inches for Latrice thanks to her heels), with a strong bass tone. You can't miss him. And you can't ignore her.\n\n\"My voice will finally be heard,\" Wilcots says about voting. \"I never saw myself as a politically involved person. I don't like politics, personally. But with issues near and dear to my heart, I feel like I have to use my voice and speak about it.\"\n\nFor Wilcots, those issues started about 2013 with same-sex marriage through Latrice's multistate campaign to mobilize minority voters to get involved in the issue. Because even those of us who had never paid much attention to politics are finding out that the decisions made at city hall, the governor's office, the White House or Congress touched everyone.\n\nAn estimated 6.1 million former felons have been locked out of voting. And black men, specifically, are affected by disenfranchisement at a rate that is seven times higher than any other group. But rather than dwell on the magnitude of disenfranchisement, it's also a great opportunity to mobilize underserved communities and engage the 18 percent of black voters in Florida whose voting rights were taken away because of the state's felony restrictions.\n\nJust as Wilcots used his persona of Latrice Royale to mobilize people, other former inmates could do the same, along with others around the country who aren't able to cast a vote. A mistake in your past shouldn't preclude you from having a voice in our democracy, or from being able to stand up for what you believe \u2014 especially for minorities, who often experience the real-life consequences of the laws enacted in the process.\n\nThere is power in sharing your story. And while no one is born a perfect activist, sometimes the most effective thing you can do to mobilize people is to let them in and show them that everyone is multidimensional. That a black man can be both an ex-felon and a drag queen. That we are more than just one mistake and we are not defined by our past. That you can be larger than life and in charge of your future.\n\nThe next elections in Florida are happening in some cities as soon as March 5. Latrice has mobilized people, but Wilcots is now the one who can cast the vote.\n\nJosh Rivera is the reader engagement and Opinion NOW editor at USA TODAY.

Here's how to reduce them.\n\nThere have been six mass shootings in America's lower-education schools in the 20 years since Columbine High School in Colorado, among them the tragedies at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida.\n\nWe have locked down a generation, armed teachers, and spent billions of dollars turning schools into fortresses because of these events. Yet in the same time frame, there have been nearly four times as many mass shootings, defined by the FBI as four or more victims killed with a gun, in an assailant\u2019s place of employment.\n\nOur response to workplace shootings has been far more muted.\n\nThe shooting Friday at Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, Illinois, in which a gunman killed five and wounded six, is a timely reminder that gun violence in America takes many forms. And although workplace shootings have declined from their peak in the 1990s, when \u201cgoing postal\u201d was both a newspaper headline and late-night TV punchline, they are still very much a part of this country\u2019s landscape.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nMilitary-style guards with guns in schools across the nation wouldn't protect students\n\nMy daughter died at Parkland. While we argue about guns, let's fix school security.\n\n'No names or photos' won't stop mass shooters, but we shouldn't humanize them\n\nFor two years, we have been studying the life histories of mass shooters for a project funded by the Justice Department. Our database of the 160 mass public shootings that have taken place in the United States since 1966 and interviews with perpetrators and survivors help put the recent Aurora shooting in context, and shed light on ways to avert these tragedies in the future.\n\nThere have been nearly 50 workplace massacres in the past 50 years that claimed the lives of six people on average (range four-14 victims). Our research, which is not yet published, shows that the perpetrators were almost exclusively men (94 percent) with an average age of 38 (the youngest was 19, the oldest was 66). More than three-quarters (77 percent) were blue-collar workers, and 53 percent had experienced a recent or traumatic change in work status before the shooting, like the Aurora shooter who was fired from his job and began shooting during his termination meeting.\n\nMany workplace shooters show signs of crisis\n\nJob loss is one of life\u2019s most stressful experiences and can be traumatic. It is associated with grief, anger and depression. However, our research finds that a workplace grievance is only part of the story. That's because 50 percent of mass workplace shooters were already showing signs of a crisis, and 51 percent were known to be suicidal before the shooting. The fact that 68 percent of mass workplace shooters in our study killed themselves or were killed on scene is important. Only people who are ready to die execute a mass shooting.\n\nOne of the people we interviewed for our study discovered that mass shooting prevention and suicide prevention were connected after his colleague committed suicide in the office parking lot the morning after he was laid off. He used one of 10 rounds of ammunition on himself and left his colleagues wondering whether the other nine rounds had been meant for them.\n\nFollowing the shooting, all staff were trained in crisis intervention and de-escalation skills. And they were encouraged to take an active interest in the lives of their colleagues so that they could spot \u201cyellow flags,\u201d or early warning signs that someone was in distress, and refer them to management. The company wanted to mitigate disgruntled employees by checking in and offering support even for problems that originated outside of the workplace.\n\nPrevent tragedy by acting on warning signs\n\nThis type of gentle vigilance is important. Compared with other types of mass public shooters, workplace killers are less likely to leak their plans in advance (only 28 percent do so), suggesting that these attacks are more impulsive and lack strategic planning. However, workplace shootings are most definitely targeted (87 percent knew their victims) and 88 percent of them involve a legally purchased firearm, typically a handgun (77 percent). Crisis intervention is key, but the window for intervention may be short.\n\nFor this reason, our research further supports \"red flag laws,\" also called gun violence restraining orders, or extreme risk protection orders, that allow family or law enforcement to seek a court order to seize a person\u2019s firearms temporarily if he shows any \u201cred flags\u201d that he poses a threat to himself or others.\n\nWorkplace mass shootings are not inevitable. The data show that training in crisis intervention and de-escalation, communication systems for warning signs, and limiting access to guns for at-risk individuals can move us toward prevention.\n\nJames Densley is a professor of criminal justice at Metropolitan State University.

It remains a viable, even necessary, option in certain parts of America: Our view\n\nLet\u2019s face it, high-speed rail does not have many successes to point to in the USA.\n\nAmerican companies created many of its technologies, and the Amtrak Metroliner was considered revolutionary when it began service in the Northeast in 1969. But the United States has, in recent years, fallen well behind countries ranging from France (1,645 miles of high-speed rail in operation) to China (about 15,530 miles).\n\nThis has not been for lack of effort. Major federal and state efforts go back as far as 1965. High-speed rail was supposed to get a jolt in 2009 when then-President Barack Obama included $8 billion in seed money in his stimulus package.\n\nBut this month's decision by California \u2014 the last state actively considering a high-speed rail system \u2014 to cancel most of its plan to link Los Angeles and San Francisco means that the money will largely go unused. In fact, the Trump administration is already pushing the state to return unspent funds.\n\nHigh-speed train model at the Capitol in Sacramento, California, in 2015. (Photo: Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nGROVER NORQUIST: California bullet train was a solution in search of a problem\n\nThis lack of progress has critics in full self-congratulatory mode. But high-speed rail remains a viable, even necessary, option in select, densely populated parts of the country. The Northeast Corridor could use an upgrade from the Amtrak Acela, which can do 150 mph but goes through significant stretches where a lower speed is required. Parts of the industrial Midwest, Florida, Texas and California would also benefit immensely.\n\nWhy can't the United States achieve what more than 20 nations have? Cost is one obstacle, but another is that one of rail's main competitors \u2014 vehicular traffic \u2014 is so wildly subsidized.\n\nMost highways were built decades ago when costs for land and rights of way were a tiny fraction of what they are now. Today, estimates of the value of the Interstate Highway System alone run into the trillions of dollars.\n\nAnd yet, while high-speed rail is expected to pay market-rate dollars for expansive land at today\u2019s prices, the nation\u2019s highway system is run as if it descended from heaven. The federal government\u2019s 18.5 cent gasoline tax does not even cover its share of the maintenance, let alone expansion. It certainly does not account for the hundreds of billions of dollars of value that highways provide to motorists each year.\n\nHigh-speed rail would stand a better chance if governments would inch their way in the direction of a market-based road system, including wider use of smart tolls.\n\nThe estimate for time Americans waste in traffic is a $87 billion a year, a staggering and growing sum that helps make the case for high-speed rail.\n\nThe worse traffic gets \u2014 and it certainly will with the growth in the number of cars \u2014 the more people will need an alternative. To some degree, this could be short-haul air traffic. But many airports already have substantial capacity issues and hassle factors.\n\nIn the end, high-speed rail is the most practical and attractive solution in certain parts of the country, if only our leaders were willing to sustain the long-term public and private investments needed to get it built. The setback in California shouldn't be the end of the line.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Time\n\nWashington tends to inflate the threat from Moscow, while simultaneously ignoring U.S. policies that exacerbate tensions, says John Glaser.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Moscow will target the United States with its new hypersonic missiles if the Trump administration follows its scrapping of a key arms control agreement by deploying new intermediate-range missiles in Europe.\n\nThe US started this tit-for-tat\n\nBy John Glaser\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has issued a clear warning to the United States: If Washington deploys new intermediate-range missiles in Europe, Moscow will, too.\n\nThe context behind this threat is President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Negotiated in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the INF was a fairly successful arms-control agreement in which each party agreed to eliminate a whole class of missiles.\n\nIn recent years, both sides accused each other of failing to fully uphold the agreement. Instead of pursuing diplomacy to resolve the dispute, Trump ordered a unilateral withdrawal, accompanied by a promise to start deploying the prohibited weapons.\n\nPutin's threat might seem like cause for alarm, but Americans should keep two things in mind.\n\nTalker: Will Trump's emergency declaration stand up in court?\n\nAsk your friends and family to sign-up for the Today's Talker newsletter\n\nFirst, hard-line policies against Russia increase the likelihood that Russia will respond in kind. From Moscow's perspective, this is a reaction to an onslaught of provocations from Washington. For all the allegations of Trump's weakness on Russia, the administration's official strategy documents single out Russia as a principal threat to U.S. security.\n\nIn addition to withdrawing from the INF, Washington has imposed harsh economic sanctions on Moscow as punishment for meddling in Ukraine. Other U.S. policies contribute to Russian feelings of insecurity. Trump has increased troop deployments in Europe and is considering opening a new military base in Poland.\n\nSecond, Putin\u2019s threat is just not all that threatening. For starters, the threat was conditional: He vowed that Russia will not be the first to deploy new intermediate-range missiles, but it will do so if the United States does first. He also expressed a willingness to return to the negotiating table, insisting that \"we don't want confrontation.\"\n\nCold War II (Photo: Martin Sutovec/Slovakia/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nMore to the point, Russian military power hardly presents a direct threat to America. Its gross domestic product is about $1.6 trillion, less than a 10th of ours, and its annual military spending is a mere $66.3 billion, compared with the more than $700 billion that we spend. Russia has nukes but possesses limited power-projection capabilities and few allies that can aid its out-of-area ambitions.\n\nRussia certainly acts aggressively in its near abroad, but Europe can easily deter it. Europe vastly outspends Russia on defense, at almost $285 billion per year.\n\nWashington tends to inflate the threat from Moscow, while simultaneously ignoring U.S. policies that exacerbate tensions. A new arms race in Europe was a predictable consequence of Trump's withdrawal from the INF. Luckily, there\u2019s still time for peaceful diplomacy to mitigate these risks. Whether the political will exists is another question entirely.\n\nJohn Glaser is director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute.

Of course, it's their right to think whatever way they want. But can they count? I'm sure they can. Let them count the range and speed of the weapons systems we are developing. That's all we ask.\"\n\nScott Dworkin\u200f, Twitter: \"Putin threatened the U.S. on Wednesday. President Donald Trump's response? Nothing. Putin's puppet' said nothing about Russia threatening the U.S. Trump's (allegedly) too busy obstructing justice, colluding with Russia, attacking the Justice Department, the FBI and the press. Biggest traitor ever. It's time to impeach Trump.\"\n\nTheodore Postol, The New York Times: \"America must recognize that the Obama administration inadvertently chose a land-based missile defense system with no defensive capacity that instead looks like a strike system to Russia. The Trump administration must stop its extremists from ending a meaningful treaty and putting the world on a faster path to oblivion. And the Russians need to pull back from their threats and boasts about their new missiles \u2014 a foolish and dangerous reaction to American bungling that plays against their own self-interest. Everyone will win if the will exists to make those compromises. Everyone will lose if not.\"\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nDon't bet on Russian President Vladimir Putin not getting his way. If President Donald Trump doesn't gather up courage on this issue, we better make sure he doesn't deploy missiles at our European allies.\n\n\u2014 Warren Weick\n\nThink about the outcome, if Trump deploys missiles to Europe: Putin loses his shackles, he can go public with his missile programs and he can just say he is simply reacting to U.S. aggression, and withdraw from the treaty.

Trump himself admitted that there is no emergency when he said, \"I didn't need to do this.\"\n\nTrump added that his reason for the declaration was that he wanted to build the wall \"much faster.\" But that's not how our democratic system works. Congress considered his desire for $5.7 billion in wall funding \u2014 and rejected it, instead appropriating $1.375 billion for new border barriers. The president cannot now try to get his way by unilaterally taking money that Congress has already budgeted for other things.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTrump border emergency is fake and climate crisis is real. Guess which just got funded?\n\nWill Trump's emergency declaration stand up in court?\n\nTrump's emergency declaration is an attack on democracy\n\nThe Constitution assigns Congress the power of the purse. Members of Congress fight to secure funding for national priorities and their constituents\u2019 needs during the yearly budget battles that dominate Washington for months.\n\nPresident Donald Trump at Florida International University in Miami on Feb. 18, 2019. (Photo: LUIS ALVAREZ/AP)\n\nThe system is far from perfect, but it's the way it works in our democracy. If Congress doesn't give him what he wants, the president can't do an end run by diverting public money for a campaign promise for which he has failed to secure funding.\n\nCongress has granted the president limited power to spend federal funds without a congressional authorization if the president declares a national emergency. But it only allows the president to spend taxpayer money on military construction projects, like overseas air bases in wartime, \"that are necessary to support such (emergency) use of the armed forces.\"\n\nThat's clearly not what's happening here. Besides the fact that there isn't actually an emergency, Trump's declaration doesn't say how a diversion of military construction funds is necessary to support the armed forces. No president has ever tried to use emergency powers to fund a massive and permanent domestic project like this.\n\nTrump is also trying to take money from funds seized by the government through anti-drug operations and forfeitures. But Congress has passed laws dictating that this money must be used only for certain law enforcement purposes. It's not a slush fund that can be used to finance presidents' unfulfilled campaign promises.\n\nTrump can't raid US Treasury at will\n\nWe filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition to stop the irreparable harm their members will suffer if Trump's illegal border wall construction plan is allowed to proceed.\n\nThe coalition's members live near the border in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. A wall would heighten divisions in border communities and promote hostility towards immigrants and communities of color in border areas. It would also increase the risk of flooding and threaten residents' access to clean water, clean air and other natural resources.\n\nIn moving forward with an unauthorized border wall, the Trump administration is ignoring decades-old environmental and public safety laws that safeguard the places, species and values that Sierra Club members work to preserve.\n\nTrump's emergency declaration is a blatant abuse of power in the service of his anti-immigrant agenda and a brazen attempt to subvert the constitutional separation of powers.\n\nThe federal treasury isn't a bank account that the president can just raid whenever he's in a bind. It's taxpayer money that the Framers specifically left in the hands of Congress. Trump is seeking to thwart Congress' will.

Slowly, it will destroy America, too.\n\nThe federal budget deficit is soaring, and you can blame it all on Republican tax cuts\n\nIs Donald Trump smart on taxes, or a clever tax con man who committed 'outright fraud'?\n\nNever mind that the size of average tax refunds varies from year to year in the U.S. \u2013 Morgan Stanley estimates total refunds will actually increase this year by 26 percent, or $62 billion.\n\nSet aside that the Treasury data is merely the first few weeks of a very unusual tax season due to the partial government shutdown. And ignore the important fact that refunds which include tax credits from earned income and additional child credits aren\u2019t reflected in these initial reports.\n\nThis claim about refunds, as the Washington Post\u2019s fact checker observed, is \u201cnonsensical and misleading.\u201d\n\nThey were describing Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 tweet, in which she purported that the size of the average tax refund is slightly down from last year, calling Republican\u2019s tax cuts a \u201cmiddle-class tax hike.\u201d She earned four Pinocchios for such a bizarre claim.\n\nRefunds are lower because taxes are lower\n\nHere are the straight facts.\n\nThe size of your tax refund has nothing to do with your overall tax bill. It merely reflects what you overpaid the IRS in your paychecks last year.\n\nFor most Americans, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivered larger paychecks starting last February, even if many workers didn\u2019t notice. The liberal Tax Policy Center confirms that 90 percent of middle-class Americans will receive a tax cut.\n\nSince many workers and families live paycheck-to-paycheck, getting at least some of their tax cut in advance, rather than delaying it a year, is a life saver.\n\nA larger paycheck throughout the year is especially important for that family of two teachers and two kids in Texas who \u2014 thanks to the GOP tax cuts \u2014 keep $2,636 more of their earnings each year to help pay utilities, the truck payment, or save for college.\n\nIt\u2019s equally crucial for the single mom with two kids in Iowa who doesn\u2019t pay a dime in federal income taxes on the first $53,000 of her hard-earned money. That means more money for groceries and getting her kids into the sports they love. And more money that can go to the credit card bill, which means less interest paid to the credit card company.\n\nYou get to control your money. Not the IRS.\n\nThanks to the tax cuts, led by President Trump, the Child Tax Credit is doubled and available to millions more parents, the standard deduction nearly doubled, tax rates were lowered at every income level, and over 90 percent of Americans will be able to use the simplest available tax form \u2014 without the hassle of itemizing.\n\nHow did that happen? Because three out of every four dollars in tax cuts went directly to individuals and small businesses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe easiest way to see for yourself is to compare your paychecks mid-year to your paychecks the year prior. Or simply look up your tax form from last year and compare to this season.\n\nIf your refund looks off, check your withholding exemptions at work. These withholding tables were updated early last year by the IRS following tax reform. Adjusting your withholding can help individuals decide if they want more in each paycheck or to receive a larger refund in the next year as taxes are filed.\n\nIt\u2019s your call. And, thanks to the GOP, it\u2019s your money.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and Rep. Kevin Brady is the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee.

Big Tech needs industry standards on how to handle this threat.\n\nTerrorist groups usually find ways to exploit the ever expanding services offered by major online platforms and tech companies, and Amazon Drive is no exception. Designed for storing and sharing photos, videos, PDFs and other forms of content, it has been adopted by the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other organizations as a stable and reliable platform for disseminating their content. They upload it and then share the links to it with followers and sympathizers, primarily using the encrypted messaging app Telegram \u2014 terrorists' \"app of choice.\"\n\nAmazon Drive, established in 2011 and previously known as Amazon Cloud Drive, can store subscribers' photos, videos and other files for access from mobile devices, desktops or Amazon Fire devices. According to the Amazon website, \"All photos, videos and other files you upload to Amazon Drive are securely and privately stored in your Files and your Amazon Photos library.\"\n\nWhile Amazon has guidelines for its many platforms, including specific bans on terrorism, \"bigotry, hatred, or illegal discrimination,\" or the use of its services by anyone who is \"the subject of U.S. sanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S. law imposed by the governments of the country where you are using Amazon Services,\" it has not been proactive in removing terrorist content.\n\nAmazon logo (Photo: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP Getty Images)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nIt's past time to learn from failures, adapt our laws to the internet age: Mark Warner\n\nConsumers should own our own data and choose who can use it: Scott McNealy\n\nFace recognition tech presents a surveillance issue and Amazon is running amok\n\nTerrorist activity and content on Amazon Drive is the subject of a new report by my organization, the Middle East Media Research Institute and its Cyber & Jihad Lab, documenting how ISIS and other groups like it have been using this free service. The examples in the report include Amazon Drive links to content such as videos by ISIS, audio messages by its leaders, and official newsletters and other content created by the group, its secondary media organizations and its supporters.\n\nBesides Amazon Drive, terrorists are also uploading content to other major platforms and sharing it via Telegram \u2014 for example, Internet Archive, Dropbox and Google Drive. Other services less widely used for uploading include Vimeo, Dailymotion, Sendvid and MediaFire, as well as Russian platforms such as Cloud.mail.ru, My.mail.ru and Ok.ru/video.\n\nAmazon should challenge terrorists online\n\nLeading tech companies like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are all now heading efforts to challenge terrorists online and on their platforms, having over time shifted their policies to reflect their maturing approach to the need to remove this content. Telegram, which remains defiant, is a notable exception. As for Amazon, not much is known about CEO Jeff Bezos' approach to terrorist content.\n\nBezos has gone on record as \"totally like-minded\" with Apple in its fight against government investigators who wanted access to the iPhone used by the December 2015 San Bernardino jihadis and had asked Apple to break encryption programs. He said Amazon was embracing similar technology to make it difficult for government officials to gain access to personal information.\n\nIn addition, Bezos told Business Insider that the debate over data privacy is \"one of the great questions of our age\" and added: \"How do you safeguard people's physical safety against terrorists and bad actors all over the world, and how do you balance that against privacy? These are very challenging questions. And we're not going to answer them, even in a few years. I think it's going to be an ongoing thing for quite a while.\"\n\nBig tech must confront these threats\n\nBy all accounts, 2018 was a good year financially for Bezos. Amazon made record profits in 2018. On Jan. 7, it became the most valuable public company in the world. For the second year in a row, Bezos ranks as the richest man in modern history. Additionally, as part of Amazon's expansion this past year, it announced that it was opening new headquarters in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C. And it is expected to spend about $5 billion on content for its Prime Video, holding talks with Viacom's Paramount Pictures and Sony.\n\nAs Amazon's popularity grows because of the convenience and security it offers, so does its responsibility to ensure that those using it for criminal purposes do not benefit from its services. Terrorist groups' use of Amazon Drive further underlines the fact that there is a need for tech philanthropists such as Bezos to devote their time and money to shaping guidelines and confronting the threat of terrorist content online. The many companies grappling with this content on their platforms, now including Amazon, highlight the need for industry standards on how to handle this threat.\n\nThe problem \u2014 and the solution \u2014 are much more complicated than the simple removal of terrorist content. Companies need to proactively monitor what\u2019s on their platforms to be sure they are not inadvertently hosting it, not wait for outsiders to expose it. Their business models should include awareness of this issue, as well as taking responsibility for it.\n\nSteven Stalinsky, executive director of the Middle East Media Research Institute, is author of \u201cAmerican Traitor: The Rise and Fall of Al-Qaeda\u2019s U.S.-born Leader Adam Gadahn.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @SteveStalinsky\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Our school had been invited, and our principal decided that everyone needed to see it. It was 1994, just two years after a jury's acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King led to outrage and burning and looting. Our school was just a few miles from the corner of Florence and Normandie, the intersection in South Los Angeles that was the epicenter of the riots.\n\nOur kids needed to put their anger and outrage in perspective.

Too many others talked, moved around and laughed at the horrors of what they were seeing. We tried to intervene, but in the dark theater it became impossible. I was mortified \u2014 as their teacher and as someone with Holocaust survivors in my extended family \u2014 but I also understood. They were teenagers, many of them had been traumatized in their own lives by gang violence and poverty and family disaster.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nCovington Catholic videos show life is complicated.

I\u2019m just glad it happened before the era of cellphone cameras and viral videos.\n\nKids are supposed to be immature\n\nThe new vigilante journalism has done much in the way of accountability for police and other public servants, but it has apparently also obliterated the line between private and public, child and adult.\n\nI am a liberal Democrat with probably few views in common with MAGA hat-wearing teenagers on their way home from an anti-abortion rally in Washington, D.C., but on behalf of all the so-called adults in this country, I am sorry for what was done to those Covington Catholic High School boys after a video of them went viral. I can understand why at least one of them hired lawyers and is planning to file defamation lawsuits against media corporations and politicos for how they were vilified. On Tuesday, a suit was filed against the Washington Post and more may be likely now that a report cleared the students of behaving in an offensive manner. The Diocese of Covington, which initially condemned the students, commissioned an investigative firm to review the available material.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether the Covington students have a legal case, but they certainly have a moral one. Not because they were mischaracterized \u2014 which they might well have been \u2014 but because they are children, and even if they did something offensive (and I am not offering an opinion as to whether they did or not) they should not be subjected to the televised and publicized judgement of grown-ups.\n\nHigh schooler Nick Sandmann, center left, and Native American activist Nathan Phillips on Friday at a rally in Washington, D.C., in January 2019.

Have we lost all perspective? Have we now witnessed so much public immaturity on the part of adults, we\u2019ve forgotten that kids are, by definition, supposed to be immature?\n\nTheir brains are not fully formed, and they are prone to excessive risk behaviors and other bad judgments. Anyone who has raised teenagers or worked with them knows this. We don\u2019t let most high school students drink or vote or sign legal contracts. Let\u2019s not make a national story out of their behavior just because someone pointed a camera at them.\n\nThose students of mine who behaved badly at the \"Schindler\u2019s List\" screening are, of course, all adults now. I still hear from some of them or see them on social media. Some of the most obnoxious that day in that theater are now really great people \u2014 hardworking, community-minded, generous and empathetic.

They'll create an environment of fear more than safety.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, we remembered the students and staff from Parkland, Florida, who one year ago were struck \u2014 not by Cupid\u2019s arrow \u2014 but by bullets from an intruder\u2019s gun.

Since the mass killing at Santa Fe High, there have been but four fatal gun assaults of students in our nation\u2019s K-12 schools, each claiming the life of a single victim. Also, in the five years before the Parkland shooting, 13 students were gunned down at schools, a tiny fraction of the thousands of school-age children shot to death over that time frame while they were away from school.\n\nA law enforcement officer in Leonardtown, Maryland, on March 20, 2018.

More important, there is no reason to overreact, which clearly is the case at a charter school in Palmetto, Florida, where military veterans are being hired to patrol the campus wearing body armor and carrying semi-automatic rifles. Principal Bill Jones believes this will send a strong message of deterrence to anyone who would contemplate an attack, even though a suicidal assailant might actually welcome a shootout.\n\nBut consider the broader message of danger relayed to students by such visible firepower: The bad guy is gunning for you. Transforming schools into armed camps does more to elevate fear than alleviate it.\n\nTalent and temperament are more important\n\nJones is not the only administrator hiring guardians and arming them with high-powered weapons. There is, however, a significant difference between civilian guardians and school resource officers who have been deployed successfully in schools across the country for decades. Not only are SROs sworn law enforcement personnel trained for the role, but they also perform a variety of functions besides guarding against armed intruders, from vandalism prevention and drug education to mentoring students and coaching athletes.\n\nBy contrast, the school guardians being recruited in Florida and elsewhere, despite having completed an intensive training program, are ill-equipped for the job in terms of talent and temperament, not weaponry.\n\nAccording to FBI data, there were 20 active shooter events at K-12 schools from 2010 through 2017, nearly half without fatalities, for an average of fewer than three incidents per year. That is in contrast to the roughly 100,000 schools in the United States. Given the exceptionally low likelihood of an active shooter attack, the overwhelming majority of the guardian\u2019s time will be idle, much like the lonely repairman in the classic Maytag commercial.\n\nPrevent shooters with guidance, not big guns\n\nNot only are the odds of an active shooter much longer than the long guns used in Palmetto, but many school shootings have occurred during nonschool hours, when guardians might not be working. Unfortunately, there is always opportunity for a determined gunman to do damage in nonsecure places. Are we going to put a guard on every yellow school bus or arm the refs at JV football games?\n\nRather than spending scare resources to deter the unlikely gunman, it is better to invest in prevention, such as hiring more teachers, guidance counselors and school psychologists. However effective in identifying and intervening with a student seemingly on the path to destruction, this will at the same time enhance the educational and social development of countless students, most of whom would never be inclined to shoot a classmate or teacher.\n\nIn 1957, while mobilizing the Arkansas National Guard to deal with the Little Rock school integration crisis, President Dwight Eisenhower lamented: \u201cIt will be a sad day for this country ... if school children can safely attend their classes only under the protection of armed guards.\u201d That sad day has come, and the concern for aggressive over-response is bigger than Little Rock.\n\nJames Alan Fox, the Lipman Professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

The latest involve dozens of new cases in New York and in Clark County, Washington, across the Columbia River from Portland.\n\nThese shouldn't be happening. The highly contagious disease \u2014 which can lead to pneumonia and, in uncommon cases, to encephalitis or even death \u2014 was all but eradicated in 2000.\n\nBut many parents, embracing scientifically debunked fears about vaccination health risks, have declined the inoculation of their children with the doses for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).\n\nIt surely doesn't help when public figures who should know better spread uninformed views. Darla Shine, wife of White House Communications Director Bill Shine, tweeted last week that childhood diseases \"keep you healthy & fight cancer\" and that \"sadly,\" her children had received the MMR.\n\nIn Vancouver, Washington in January 2019. (Photo: Gillian Flaccus/AP)\n\nActually, her kids are safer because they've had the vaccine.\n\nThe core issue is that too many states make it too easy for parents to avoid having their children immunized. While all 50 require vaccinations, 17 states allow parents to opt out for personal reasons.\n\nEven if their offspring get and survive the illness, they selfishly place at serious risk other children who can't be vaccinated because of legitimate medical concerns such as a compromised immune system. Those children are protected only when virtually everyone else in the community is immunized, breaking the chain of infection.\n\nEven worse, in 2016 scientists found that a deadly measles neurological complication, which lies dormant in children for years, is more common than previously thought, arising in 1 out of 609 cases where unvaccinated babies contract the disease.\n\nRecent outbreaks underscore the risks of allowing nonmedical exemptions.\n\nForty-seven states let parents opt out for religious reasons. Among them is New York, where there have been more than 70 cases of measles in New York City since October, including cases among unvaccinated children within an Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn. In Rockland County, there have been 135 cases since September.\n\nThe state of Washington allows both religious and personal exemptions. The result is that only 78 percent of children ages 6 to 18 in Clark County have received the necessary two doses of MMR. Almost all of the 62 confirmed cases of measles in that county this year involved no prior immunization.\n\nThree states \u2014 California, Mississippi and West Virginia \u2014 allow vaccination exemptions strictly for medical reasons. Not coincidentally, their two-dose MMR rates for kindergartners are 96.9 percent, 99.4 percent and 98.4 percent, respectively.\n\nThe outbreak in Washington has prompted legislators to consider a measure sponsored by a Clark County Republican state representative that would deny MMR exemptions based on personal beliefs.\n\nFor all the sense this makes, hard-core opposition remains fierce. Even as children fell ill, hundreds of naysayers arrived at the Washington statehouse to voice opposition. When California passed an even stricter law in 2015, the sponsor \u2014 state Sen. Richard Pan \u2014 received death threats.\n\nDespite the blowback, government requirements are the right things to do, along with public education campaigns. Exemptions to state-mandated vaccinations should be granted only for narrowly prescribed medical or religious reasons.

While 60 percent of progressive activists believe that race should be considered in college admissions, 85 percent of Americans disagreed and thought race should not be taken into account.\n\nMichelle Obama dances with Chicago school children in her Let's Move program on Feb. 28, 2013.

Does US love Latinos or not?\n\nDemocrats should pair off now. It'll raise the odds of a strong 2020 presidential ticket.\n\nAnother large-scale survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2017 found that white liberals have become so radical, they are now even more likely to attribute racial inequality to discrimination than blacks.\n\nThe leftward drift of progressives could be justified as an appropriate response to Trump\u2019s reactionary policies, but it also pushes them further from the values held by most Americans. Progressives threaten to enter escape velocity, to escape the earth\u2019s gravitational pull and enter the gloom of deep space and smug political irrelevance.\n\nProgressive Democratic presidential aspirants need to think creatively and strategically about this challenge: How can they form coalitions between liberal Democrats and other voters over what has become a wider ideological divide over race? How can they appeal to the base they need to win primaries as well as to the other Americans they need to win general elections?\n\nThe Obamas showed the path forward\n\nThe best way for Democratic candidates to approach this dilemma is to support policies that entail what the political scientist Theda Skocpol described as targeting within universalism. They should advocate polices that are neutral with regards to race, that are universal, but that target their benefits disproportionately to blacks and other minorities. Two examples from Barack and Michelle Obama show how this can be done.\n\nObamacare offered health insurance to those who could not afford it. This policy was racially neutral on its face, but not in its impact. A disproportionate number of uninsured were minorities, and they benefited disproportionately from Obamacare. Higher take-up rates for minorities under Obamacare reduced the disparity in health insurance coverage nationwide between minorities and whites.\n\nMichelle Obama\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign against childhood obesity is another example. It was designed to address the problem of nearly 14 million American children suffering from obesity. But obesity rates are 50 percent higher for black children and 85 percent higher for Hispanic kids than they are for whites. Minorities benefited disproportionately from the government\u2019s efforts to encourage kids to exercise more and eat healthier foods to reduce the incidence of childhood obesity.\n\nHelp the needy by 'not talking about them'\n\nSocial policy advocates have long argued the benefits of universal over targeted programs. Targeted programs to marginalized groups do not generate the political support needed to sustain them. Middle-class people do not want to pay taxes to support programs that don\u2019t include them, regardless of the benefits the poor may derive from such programs. Similarly, whites are reluctant to support race-based programs that exclude them or are perceived as coming at their expense, regardless of the historical justification for them.\n\nThe political scientist Hugh Heclo once advised that the best way to help the poor was by \u201cnot talking about them.\u201d He wasn\u2019t suggesting that advocates ignore the poor, but that when they design policies to assist the poor, they shouldn't be about them. We need to think about race in the same way.\n\nThis is a big ask. Targeted, race-based programs are seductive because they offer validation to marginalized groups. But they also may offer little of real value except symbolic recognition. Targeted, race-based policies also meet the needs of those whose business models or careers depend on fueling racial grievance and promoting black or Hispanic identity. Disregarding their self-interested groans of being ignored and snubbed will take forbearance and courage.\n\nThe widening gap between the left and the rest of the country over racial issues makes building majority coalitions harder at the very moment they have never been more necessary for progressives. Democratic presidential aspirants are all going to encounter this tension. Policies that advocate targeting within universalism will help them navigate this treacherous terrain.\n\nAlan Draper is the Michael W. Ranger and Virginia R.

I was not proud of what I found.\n\nDuring this time, I reflected not just on my behavior on social media, but also in my public expressions both on TV and in my columns. I looked back over the past decade of my work with a clear eye to assess whether I was shedding light on issues or just creating heat. I cringed at many of the things I had written and said. Many I would not say or write today, sometimes because my view has changed on the issue and sometimes just because I was too much of a crusader, too judgmental and condemning. What\u2019s interesting is that at the time, I was convinced that I was righteous and \u201cspeaking truth\u201d and therefore justified behaving as I did, and that anyone who didn\u2019t like it just \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle the truth.\u201d \u201cThe truth hurts\u201d was practically my motto.\n\nCovington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann faces Native American Nathan Phillips in Washington on Jan. 18, 2019. (Photo: Survival Media Agency via AP)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nParkland survivors, social media scrutiny and lessons from 'The Breakfast Club'\n\nLike Kevin Hart, I also made a bad joke on stage. Unlike Hart, I learned from the experience.\n\nI loved Facebook. After 12 years of daily use, here's why I'm unfriending it for good.\n\nWhen I took to Twitter Monday to apologize for my lack of grace in the public square, many people expressed concern that I would stop speaking with moral clarity on important issues. This is not my goal. I will continue to stand on the side of equality and justice, but also mercy and grace. My goal is to speak in a way that remembers the humanity of everyone involved.\n\nThat includes the Covington teenagers, who I believe behaved disrespectfully, but who don\u2019t deserve to have their entire lives defined by one day. It includes Trump supporters whom I, in an attempt to raise awareness of the issue of white privilege, not too long ago regrettably characterized as uniformly racist for voting for him. Not exactly a conversation starter.\n\nAs I surveyed my work, I realized I have changed\n\nIt also applies to Al Franken, whom I called on to resign from the U.S. Senate but now believe he should have been given an investigation even if it resulted in cries of \u201chypocrisy\u201d from the right. It includes Planned Parenthood, which I have excoriated in years past in ways I would never do today. It includes those on the left who were the targets of my 2015 book on free speech, in which I was too dismissive of real concerns by traumatized people and groups who feel marginalized and ignored.\n\nAs I surveyed my work, the thing that struck me is how much I have changed. I\u2019m not the same person I was a year ago, let alone 25 years ago. Yet our media routinely dig up information from decades ago and demands judgment be delivered with no regard to whether the person has evolved. We need to be more interested in who people are today, not who they were decades ago.\n\nMore: How a few shady social media posts fed a viral firestorm over Covington Catholic (and why it will happen again)\n\nDon\u2019t we want people to change and grow? We should. Yet even if they have, demands for heads to roll abound when their ancient sins are unearthed. When old homophobic tweets by MSNBC\u2019s Joy-Ann Reid were discovered, there was a clamor for her firing. But did even a single person believe that in her current life she's a homophobic person?\n\nThis is not an argument against accountability. It\u2019s an argument for us to think about whether the punishment fits the crime. Al Franken shouldn\u2019t get the same punishment that Les Moonves did because they didn\u2019t do the same things. As a baseline rule, a person losing his job should not be the default punishment for noncriminal behavior or behavior where there hasn\u2019t been an impartial investigation.\n\nWe need humility and an end to scapegoating\n\nWe need to have humility and realize that there but for the grace of God go I. It\u2019s easy to delude yourself that you would never do whatever today\u2019s designated bad person is accused of doing. But don\u2019t be so sure. Given the wrong circumstances, people would be surprised at what they are capable of doing.\n\nWe also need to recognize what we are doing: It\u2019s called scapegoating.\n\nIn the Bible, a scapegoat was an animal burdened with the sins of others through a ritual, then driven away. This is in effect what our society does when we designate certain people to bear our collective sins. Once it's discovered that a person behaved in a racist, homophobic or misogynist way \u2014 often in the distant past \u2014 she is banished from society, creating a sense that something has been accomplished. That somehow there has been atoning because someone was punished.\n\nThis creates two problems: First, the systemic problem still exists. Second, one person is not responsible for the sins of everyone. People should not be treated as disposable and banished in perpetuity with no path to restoration with society. Would you want that to happen to you?\n\nIt\u2019s critical to remember that people simply are not the sum of their worst moments in life. Go back through your life and write down every terrible thing you have done or said, and now imagine a video of it is on the internet. Would you want that to be the record of your life? Don\u2019t underestimate the power of denial. I frequently hear people who I knew to be homophobic 20 years ago express indignance over anyone who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage today with no sense of self-awareness.\n\nWe need to create a culture of fair forgiveness\n\nI know there is a double standard when it comes to the benefit of the doubt in our culture. People of color, especially young black men, rarely receive the benefit of the doubt or context for their failings and can receive a literal death sentence as a result. I just don\u2019t believe that refusing to provide white people the benefit of the doubt will right that wrong. The way to right it is to have one standard for all people and to actively work to reform a system that is fundamentally discriminatory.\n\nIt\u2019s often noted by people on the left that conservatives don\u2019t understand systemic oppression because they think of everything as an individual case. They fail to accept the larger picture that all of those cases create. I agree with this. But the corollary is that sometimes people who are left of center can fall prey to only seeing the systemic and missing the individual. I\u2019m certainly guilty of that.\n\nWe need to develop a way to address the systemic problems in society without throwing sacrifices to the gods in the hope of a quick fix. We need to reform a culture that is fundamentally punitive and willing to throw away people\u2019s lives for making a mistake. Our prisons are filled with such people.\n\nWe also need to create a culture of repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation that is based on those who have made mistakes taking responsibility for those errors \u2014 however grievous \u2014 and working toward righting the wrong in which they participated.\n\nThis would be a radical shift, but one I am determined to make.\n\nI hope you will join me.\n\nKirsten Powers, a CNN news analyst, writes regularly for USA TODAY and is co-host of The Faith Angle podcast.

His supporters also have some valid grievances about how the 2016 Democratic primary was shaped to benefit Hillary Clinton \u2014 creating an animosity that led Sanders to wait until the Democratic National Convention to endorse her. Some of his fiercest backers never ended up \u201cwith her,\u201d preferring the \u201crevolution\u201d instead.\n\nNot the 'revolution' Sanders backers wanted\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the \u201crevolution.\u201d\n\nNeil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.

And Clinton supporters can blame Sanders backers for demonizing the nation's first female major-party presidential nominee and helping Trump slip through the Electoral College.\n\nWho was right?

Start work now to avoid national heartbreak in 2020.\n\nTrump State of the Union address lays smart groundwork for 2020 re-election campaign\n\nHow billionaires like Schultz and Bloomberg can help America: Don't run for president\n\nWe do know that the massive rot that allowed a Donald Trump to become president did not grow in one primary season.\n\nAnd we do know that beef between Sanders and Clinton supporters has largely been overblown. Even after the bruising 2016 election, most Democrats and Democrat-leaners liked both candidates.\n\nWe also can guess the Trump and GOP plan for 2020, if he survives until then. It will look a lot like 2016 \u2014 suppress votes; hype up third-party candidates so Trump can win with even less than the 46.1 percent of the vote he got in 2016; and, most important, destroy the Democratic candidate, likely with the help of foreign powers and the news media, by accusing her or him of being as corrupt and compromised as Donald Trump.\n\nBernie Sanders is doing Democrats a favor\n\nThe last thing we want to do is help Trump, so here\u2019s how we can make sure we don\u2019t destroy the only candidate who can beat him:\n\n\u25baWe\u2019re all in this together. To anyone who loves to point out that Bernie is not a Democrat, you are praising the Bern, not burning him. He could guarantee Trump\u2019s re-election by running as an independent. He\u2019s doing you and America a favor.\n\n\u25baSave your fury for Trump. The lesson of the 2016 GOP primary is that in a field of more than a dozen candidates, anyone can win (so look out for the billionaires).\n\nFavor attacks on policy over assaults on character. It\u2019s fair to call out a candidate\u2019s record as a prosecutor, for instance, but avoid the trap of playing up disinformation like, say, if a candidate was honest about when she listened to Snoop and Tupac.\n\nCandidates should take it upon themselves to continually remind their supporters, and everyone, that anyone the Democrats nominate is going to be a giant compared with the current president or his doting vice president.\n\n\u25baNo candidate, not even yours, is perfect. One of the most effective attacks on Clinton was that, as first lady, she championed the 1994 crime bill that helped skyrocket incarceration. But the bizarre thing was that Sanders voted for the bill as a House member and Clinton couldn\u2019t vote on it at all.\n\nRemember that redistricting is the ball game\n\nNo politician is without sin. Try to take a candidate's evolution as a good thing and not a sign of being contrived and opportunistic, even if the candidate is a woman.\n\n\u25baHealth care can be your litmus test. It\u2019s a good thing the health care debate on the left is largely over whether we should just expand Medicare or make sure everyone has it.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican policies have already left 7 million more Americans uninsured, Gallup has found, and the administration is backing a lawsuit that could \u201cterminate\u201d Obamacare and could easily win, especially if Trump gets another Supreme Court pick.\n\nMake maximalist demands. Make sure your candidate backs the plan you want and then get that candidate nominated. If it doesn\u2019t work, you can do something far more important, and that is to ...\n\n\u25baRemember that 2020 is a redistricting election. You will be voting during a Census year that will bring new electoral maps in 2022. If you don\u2019t get the nominee you love, don't despair. Vote for the Democratic nominee \u2014 the only person who can beat Trump \u2014 and then go down ballot. Help kick Republicans out of as many state legislative seats as possible so another decade won\u2019t be gerrymandered away.\n\nWe know this for sure: Donald Trump will refuse to admit defeat. That\u2019s why it\u2019s our job to crush him beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 and not crush each other.\n\nJason Sattler, a writer based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a member of USA TODAY\u2019s Board of Contributors and host of \"The GOTMFV Show\" podcast.

No, there is no cure, nor any on the horizon. Yes, we were counseled in-depth on our options, including adoption. Because we wanted to spare our daughter as much suffering as possible, our choice was very sad, but crystal clear: abortion.\n\nKate Carson in Paris, France, in 2016. (Photo: Family handout)\n\nI imagined an abortion at eight months would be grisly. But no matter how violent my imagination, it surely could not compare with the suffering Laurel would have endured in her own broken body.\n\nIn Massachusetts, my home state, a later abortion can be obtained only if the life or health of the mother is at risk. So I set off on a 2,000-mile journey from Massachusetts to Colorado to access this abortion. I landed, not in the nightmare I had imagined, but in the safest, kindest, most dignified hands I have ever encountered as a patient anywhere. Dr. Warren Hern at his Boulder Abortion Clinic is one of the few doctors in the country performing this procedure. After a single injection and a couple of hours, my baby was laid to rest in my womb, the purest mercy that I knew how to give my Laurel.\n\nAs the usual hubbub of hate and misunderstanding around abortion swelled to a roar this month, the president unfairly addressed families like mine in his State of the Union address. He hasn't really listened to women like me or doctors like Dr. Hern. He seems to care nothing for the true stories of heartbreak, loss and extreme medical complexity behind abortion later in pregnancy. Instead, his agenda must inflate fear and horror until every last American thinks of unspeakable violence.\n\nMercy means something different to each family\n\nThis is not about abortion. It is about power. This administration needs the public to be angry at women like me and misinformed about what compels women to seek later abortions, which make up less than 1.5 percent of abortions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But I believe that Americans can hear our story and meet the painful, complicated truth about abortions later in pregnancy with love and understanding.\n\nAnd most Americans have compassion for a woman's choice when it comes to her reproductive health care. In fact, nearly 70 percent of Americans do not want to see the Supreme Court completely overturn Roe v. Wade, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nNobody loves Laurel more than I do. Her death was a gift of mercy. Mercy means different things to different loving families, and that has to be OK. To all the families who faced similar circumstances and made a different choice, I honor you. I trust your wisdom. I celebrate your child\u2019s brief and beautiful life.\n\nWe must treat each other with love, tenderness and respect. It is horrible, as a parent, to choose between life and peace for our children, especially when we want to give our children both beautiful and precious gifts.\n\nIt is devastating to lose a child. But, unlike most bereaved parents, women like me will live out the rest of our lives as scapegoats, fuel for an agenda that seeks to strip women and families of our reproductive freedoms.\n\nWhen I think of my baby Laurel, I feel love and peace. Unfortunately, I cannot be with that peace because there are fresh wounds in the way, the throbbing pain of being hated and misunderstood.\n\nKate Carson is a teacher and mother who lives with her family in the Boston area.

Despite receiving virtually every single newspaperendorsement and promoting a message of working across the aisle, the negative attacks and outside money kept coming.

Here are the issues we need to address to win statewide.\n\nDon't ignore voters in nonelection years\n\nFirst, the immense size of the state makes it nearly impossible to campaign without tens of millions of dollars committed. With 10 TV markets across two time zones, it'll cost upwards of $2 million a week to hit each of them with campaign ads. And that's before you take into account digital ads, radio ads and campaign mail.\n\n\n\nSecond, Florida has an extremely diverse population, and turnout among voters of color is unpredictable \u2014 especially in midterm years. Cubans have been historically loyal to the Republican Party, while newer Democratic-leaning voters from Puerto Rico and Central and South America are still growing in political clout. These groups are not monolithic, certainly not on the subject of immigration, and they require more than an election-year touch to stay active. African-American voters, many of whom live in major metro areas like Miami and Jacksonville, are also often ignored until October of the election year.\n\n\n\nThird, it takes a disciplined candidate to deliver a message that resonates in the many disparate regions of Florida. One might think of Florida as an amalgam of six or seven states, each with its own distinct attributes and cultures. There are Democratic-leaning snowbirds In Palm Beach, Republican-leaning retirees in the Villages and millions combined in the Panhandle, Central Florida and the Keys in between.\n\nDemocrats can't afford another heartbreaker\n\nDemocrats thought they had found the winning combination in 2018 \u2014 the stalwart Nelson would appeal to the moderates and rural voters who had kept him in office for a generation, while the liberal Gillum would turn out progressives and minority voters at a historic rate. Yet despite a national electorate that leaned almost 9 points Democratic, both fell short.\n\nThere's no silver bullet to this dilemma, but Democrats must solve it soon if we hope to remain competitive. We need to engage minority voters effectively, and not just in election years. We need to sustain a grassroots volunteer and fundraising base that can be tapped into every cycle. We need to support a bench of future statewide candidates who can appeal to the myriad communities across the state. We must register thousands of ex-felons whose voting rights were recently restored via ballot initiative.\n\nAnd we need to fight for votes in the small towns that dot Florida along Interstate 95 and the I-4 corridor, not just in the major population centers. Is it any wonder voters there have turned so completely to the GOP? There is no reason the Democrats' economic message can't compete with the Republican pitch.\n\n\n\nUntil we find a formula that works, Florida Democrats will slink behind our counterparts in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina on the presidential swing-state circuit. The 2020 race is just around the corner, and we can't afford another heartbreaking loss with so much at stake both here in Florida and across the country.\n\nPatrick Murphy, a senior fellow at Florida International University in Miami, represented Florida's 18th district in Congress from 2013 to 2017 and was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2016.

He could be holding back charges for strategic reasons. That's what I did as a prosecutor.\n\nOne of the most intriguing recent court filings in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation came Friday in a brief arguing that Roger Stone\u2019s case is related to the indictment against 12 officers from Russia's GRU military intelligence agency. They were charged with conspiring to defraud the United States by hacking, stealing and staging the release of email messages.\n\nStone was indicted in January on various charges of obstructing the House intelligence Committee investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Under local court rules, cases should be designated as \u201crelated\u201d if they arise \u201cfrom a common wiretap, search warrant, or activities which are a part of the same alleged criminal event or transaction.\u201d Related cases are then assigned to the same judge.\n\nMueller argues that Stone\u2019s case meets this standard because evidence in his case \u201cwas found in accounts that were subject to search warrants\u201d that were executed in the GRU case, and because his alleged obstruction was \"directed at a congressional investigation into conduct\" that was the basis for the GRU indictment.\n\nEvidence of Stone contact with GRU, WikiLeaks\n\nOne detail in the new filing jumps out. It says \u201cthe government obtained and executed dozens of search warrants on various accounts used to facilitate the transfer of stolen documents for release, as well as to discuss the timing and promotion of their release. Several of those search warrants were executed on accounts that contained Stone\u2019s communications with Guccifer 2.0 and with Organization 1.\u201d\n\nGuccifer 2.0 is alleged to be a persona operated by the GRU, and Organization 1 is believed to be WikiLeaks.\n\nThis passage is revealing for several reasons. First, the filing discloses that the government has evidence of Stone\u2019s direct communications with Russian intelligence and WikiLeaks. This revelation goes much further than the Stone indictment itself and establishes a direct link between Russia and Stone, a Trump campaign adviser.\n\nReferring to these communications as \u201cevidence\u201d suggests that the special counsel considers the communications probative and relevant to proving Stone\u2019s guilt. Whatever these communications are, we can reasonably conclude that they are incriminating.\n\nRoger Stone leaves federal court in Washington on Feb. 1, 2019. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nThe Trump investigations are coming at last. Can Republicans handle the truth?\n\nHere's why you should have faith in Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation\n\nStone indictment: Serious Russia investigation charges hint Mueller has more coming\n\nSecond, the filing indicates that search warrants were used to obtain these communications. Search warrants can be used to obtain email and social media accounts, including the content of every email or Twitter direct message a user has ever sent or received. These communications would help Mueller determine whether Stone was ever in direct contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, as Stone claimed in August 2016.\n\nIn addition, a search warrant can be used to obtain emails from internet service providers doing business in the United States, even if the account user is overseas. If, for example, a Russian hacker were using a Gmail account, a search warrant to Google could provide every email ever sent or received on that account. And if the special counsel has obtained Stone\u2019s email communications, it seems likely that he has also obtained the email communications of others, such as Donald Trump Jr., who has admitted to sending email messages to set up a meeting with Russians to obtain dirt on Hillary Clinton in June 2016.\n\nThird, the phrase \u201cto discuss the timing and promotion of their release\u201d emphasizes that Mueller considers the conspiracy with which he has charged the Russian intelligence officers to include not just hacking and stealing emails, but also disseminating them. The GRU indictment provides a framework for adding as co-conspirators anyone else who conspired to promote the release of the stolen emails at a time that would be most beneficial to Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn fact, one batch of emails was released about an hour after news broke about the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump was heard disparaging women. If someone from the campaign suggested to WikiLeaks that stolen emails be released that day, that person could potentially be charged as a co-conspirator in the GRU case.\n\nStrategic reasons to hold back on charges\n\nWhy, then, has Stone not been charged with conspiring with WikiLeaks or Russian intelligence officers? It could be that the evidence does not prove his agreement to engage in a conspiracy. Or it might be that Mueller is holding back on charging Stone as he investigates other targets.\n\nWhen I served as a prosecutor, we sometimes strategically waited before charging every crime we believed we could prove. Mueller may be doing the same here for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, Mueller might want to avoid tipping off other targets until he has been able to gather all of the evidence against them. Second, by charging only the seven counts in the Stone indictment, Mueller doesn't have to produce to Stone discovery or evidence of other crimes while he continues to investigate the roles of other targets. Court rules would require such disclosure of charged crimes. And third, by holding back more serious crimes, Mueller has leverage over Stone to offer a plea and cooperation deal that is less severe than it would be if more crimes were charged.\n\nIf that's the case, then a superseding indictment with more charges, and maybe more defendants, may be in Stone\u2019s future.\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, is a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.

But declaring a national emergency isn\u2019t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs\n\nDonald Trump funds 'emergency' border wall but relief for victims of wildfires, storms and other climate change-fueled catastrophes must wait.\n\nOne emergency, the border wall, is fake, invented by a rogue president desperate for a political win no matter the price. Another, the climate crisis, is real, with tens of millions of citizen victims around the country. Guess which one got funded?\n\nPresident Donald Trump is risking a constitutional crisis by declaring a false national emergency to fund a border wall that his own government experts say isn\u2019t needed and won\u2019t work, and of which he himself says, \"I didn't need to do this.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the bill Trump signed last week to keep the government open leaves out tens of billions of dollars of relief for American citizens who are victims of hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters made worse by climate change.\n\nThis should not be a shock to anyone paying close attention. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, reacting to earlier reports, last week pointedly denied that the administration would raid relief funds designated for victims of storms and wildfires to get money for Trump's dubious border wall.\n\nOutside the White House on June 1, 2017. (Photo: Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nDonald Trump's emergency declaration is an attack on democracy\n\nTrump emergency sets precedent Republicans will regret\n\nTrump can call a 'national emergency,' but that doesn't mean he can build the wall\n\nThe president, who denies basic climate science and is rolling back key climate protections, would have been taking money from its victims to escape the consequences of his own manufactured government-shutdown crisis \u2014 all to build a wall that will be ineffective and even counterproductive in improving border security.\n\nA firestorm of criticism prevented that. Yet here we are about a month later with much the same outcome.\n\nRepublicans hide emergency spending costs\n\nMeanwhile, the costs of climate change in American lives and money are growing exponentially. They include more damaging hurricanes, bigger and more intense wildfires, sea-level rise and the spread of infectious disease.\n\nCongress passed more than $130 billion in emergency spending related to climate change just between September 2017 and March 2018. That\u2019s nearly a quarter of the annual nondefense discretionary budget of the entire U.S. government. Indeed, Trump\u2019s own National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration finds that the \u201ccumulative cost of the 16 separate billion-dollar weather events in the U.S. in 2017 was $306.2 billion.\u201d\n\nYet budget tricks keep these huge costs hidden from American taxpayers. Lawmakers and the president are not required to increase taxes to pay for emergency funding. Thus, Trump and other Republicans deny the climate crisis. Eventually, when they get around to it, they fund the recovery but hide the massive costs from public scrutiny.\n\nWhite House is cavalier about climate change\n\nFar worse is coming. Disasters exacerbated by climate change will cost trillions of dollars by the end of this century, according to budget experts. In November 2016, an Office of Management and Budget assessment warned of tens of billions in additional costs from wildfires, crop insurance, flood insurance, health care spending and other problems related to climate change.\n\nBut instead of acting to address the climate change crisis and its costs, Trump is actually rolling back key climate protections at every chance. He is overturning major rules to cut emissions from power plants, cars and trucks, oil and gas development and many other areas, purposefully making the problem worse. One wonders when the American people are going to tire of Trump risking their safety, the economy, the deficit and our long-term security for his own perceived political gain.\n\nTrump\u2019s responses to the record-breaking hurricanes that hit America in the past 18 months have been similarly cavalier. He directly lied about the deaths of thousands of U.S. citizens, ignoring studies showing that thousands died in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 due to lost power at hospitals and elsewhere.\n\nTrump ignores real crises and invents fake ones\n\nInfamously, Trump falsely blamed mismanagement of public lands and forests as the main reason for wildfires in California and much of the West. In fact, leading experts say climate change is a key reason U.S. wildfires are getting larger; a 2016 study found they had spread across double the area affected in 1984.\n\nMajor studies have also found that up to 20 inches of Hurricane Harvey\u2019s record 52-inch rainfall was due to much warmer Gulf of Mexico temperatures caused by climate change, and that other recent hurricanes were also made more destructive because of underlying climate change. Yet why would the president let actual science and the safety of the American people get in the way of short-term politics?\n\nBorder security is important. Both Democrats and Republicans have said so and have serious plans to address it. But Trump\u2019s dubious border wall isn\u2019t about security, it\u2019s an attempt to salvage a bogus campaign pledge.\n\nNever mind that the actual climate crisis is harming average Americans every day \u2014 costing lives, undermining our public safety and hurting our economy. Trump only does fake emergencies.\n\nPaul Bledsoe is a professorial lecturer at American University\u2019s Center for Environmental Policy and a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute.

Get over it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a moral recommendation on how businesses should treat their customers, or an invitation for brands to employ surveillance on consumers. It was a realistic and factual comment on the growing scope and capacity of internet technology, the just emerging smartphone access, and on how consumers were wielding that technology.\n\nBack then, the social media platforms we all use today were yet to be conceived, banner ads were innovative and cool, and consumers were unaware of the wealth of data being collected on them.\n\nFast-forward 20 years, and we\u2019re truly in the midst of a new age of privacy challenges. Digital consumers are more confused and suspicious than ever when it comes to the unconditional transfer of their personal data, and they are quickly becoming more interested in their rights under burgeoning privacy legislation sweeping the globe. The Cambridge Analytica scandal didn\u2019t just make the tech press but unfolded on front pages the world over. And with every negative headline, consumer trust has eroded in organizations that use purchased data sets, cookies and click trails to power their marketing.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook (Photo: Justin Lane/epa-EFE)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nSocial media companies are the real 'enemies of the people'\n\nAt stake in Cambridge Analytica scandal? Not just privacy, but freedom itself: Chertoff\n\nYou are not friends with Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg. You are their product.\n\nThe reality is that the technology and tools that businesses have employed to snoop on consumers is so sophisticated and stealthy that consumer education and, in many legislators' minds, regulations are needed to stop the unauthorized collection, repackaging and reselling of this data.\n\nThe age of fast and loose data collection and redistribution must come to an end and be replaced by enhanced consumer privacy education and commitments, so therefore I am not surprised by Tim Cook\u2019s unfortunate call for federal privacy regulations.\n\nPersonally, I would rather see businesses move more proactively and compete with other businesses on their own Customer Bill of Privacy Rights. And I would also rather see regulators spend more efforts to protect citizens from government abuse of personal data. The invisible hand of private markets will work if we educate ourselves, but it does not work on the government abuses. Only voting can fix that.\n\nConsumers should know where their data are\n\nInformed consumers should make sure they understand what the brands they purchase from are committing to with respect to their data. If business doesn\u2019t act first, I fear that government will step in and regulate, creating confusion, bureaucracy, reduced choices and increased cost for consumers.\n\nHence, I do not support Cook's suggestion that government should be the data clearinghouse for all our personal data. We don\u2019t just need privacy protection as consumers, we need it as citizens as well. Government has access to even more sophisticated tools for snooping, collecting and storing data on us. And I would argue they have the capacity for much greater harm than businesses like Facebook, Cambridge Analytica or Acxiom.\n\nYou can always shut down your Facebook account, switch your phone carrier, or buy online from someone else who respects your data. It is very hard to control rogue government abuses and roll back bad legislation.\n\nThe files released by Edward Snowden revealed the National Security Agency was collecting huge amounts of data on millions of American citizens. From secret court orders forcing Verizon to hand over call records on millions of Americans daily, to the use of secret programs such as XKeyscore, an analytical tool that allows for collection of almost anything done on the internet, our privacy is constantly compromised without our knowing.\n\nFor many Americans, it was a shock that the government surveillance program was so extensive in its targeting of masses of ordinary U.S. citizens. Privacy rights and regulations is a discussion that should not just be constrained to consumers and businesses, but also citizens and governments. The past few years have shown us there is much work to do in both areas.\n\nMore important, the amount of data collected and the abuses (past, present and future) perpetrated by the government become ever more problematic as federal, state and local scope creep accelerates. When I was a child, we did not have a Department of Education, Obamacare, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, massive student loan programs, free phones, up to 40 million people on food stamps, massive regulation and the more than $2 trillion of federal redistribution annually. Government has become far too important in the lives of far too many of our citizens. Giving it unregulated access to our personal data is dangerous.\n\nRebuilding trust starts with openly sharing data\n\nIf businesses want to rebuild trust and build more meaningful connections with consumers, then it\u2019s time to embrace the Zero-Party Data economy. \"Zero-Party Data\" was coined by Forrester\u2019s principal analyst, Fatemeh Khatibloo. It describes a class of data intentionally and proactively shared directly with businesses by the consumer, such as preference insights and purchase intentions, often in return for some sort of value exchange like access to content, offers or competitions.\n\nThis is a much more transparent, honest and fair way to collect and use consumer data for personalized marketing. It contrasts heavily with the way marketing has developed over the past few years, championed by companies like Facebook, where marketers were encouraged to leverage a coterie of third-party data suppliers and data integrations, to target people with the right advertising at the right time.\n\nMake no mistake, informed consumer consent was never gathered for the way these data have been repackaged and resold across the marketing supply chain. Brands should distance themselves from indulging in personalized marketing that relies on such data, or platforms that promote their use.\n\nPersonalization of marketing communications should be driven only from what is proactively shared by consumers with their consent. We should have the expectation as consumers to own our own data, and choose who can use it.\n\nData have the power to create huge monopolies, or even influence democracies. Transparency in these matters is essential for a healthy world, both as consumers and citizens.\n\nScott McNealy is the chairman and co-founder of Wayin, founder of Curriki and the former chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems.

This is outrageous \u2014 but drug companies aren\u2019t to blame. The problem is a dysfunctional supply chain that benefits everyone except patients.\n\nIn today\u2019s system, insurers hire third-party firms, known as pharmacy benefit managers, to manage drug plans.

If co-insurance were instead based on the net price, the patient would owe just $21.\n\nThe Trump administration just proposed a rule requiring PBMs and insurers to pass discounts to patients at the point of sale. Diabetes patients on Medicare could save $350 per year at the pharmacy counter if this proposal takes effect.\n\nThe much needed reform would force drug companies to compete based on who can offer the best price to patients, not who can offer the biggest hidden discounts to PBMs.\n\nSally C.

The Supreme Court should declare it impermissible, and I believe it will.\n\nThe most important Supreme Court precedent is a 1952 case, Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer. The union representing steel workers staged a strike during the Korean War, threatening the supply of steel needed to produce military armaments.\n\nPresident Harry Truman issued an executive order seizing the steel mills to keep them operating, so as not to imperil the war effort. The Supreme Court held that the president's actions were unconstitutional.\n\n\"In the framework of our Constitution, the president's power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker,\" Justice Hugo Black wrote in his opinion for the court. \"The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad.\"\n\nTalker: The Republican hypocrisy over Ilhan Omar's comment\n\nAsk your friends and family to sign-up for the Today's Talker newsletter\n\nTrump has invoked his authority under the National Emergencies Act of 1976. Sounds good, but on closer review of the play, it should be overruled.\n\nThis law was passed in the wake of President Richard Nixon's tenure to restrict the use of presidential power. It is inconceivable that, in passing this law, Congress intended to delegate to future presidents the power to implement projects unilaterally whenever frustrated by an inability to get congressional approval for them.\n\nAny realistic appraisal of Trump's declaration will classify it as an act in defiance of Congress. He asked for the border wall funding, Congress said \"no,\" and he said \"I call emergency.\"\n\nFurthermore, a constitutional principle known as the \"nondelegation doctrine\" bars Congress from delegating legislative authority to the president. Congress may delegate discretionary authority to the president, but it must provide some \"intelligible principle\" to guide that authority.\n\nThe Constitution does not permit Congress to simply say, \"Here is a blank check to spend $20 billion as you see fit \u2014 just do what you think is good for the country.\u201d\n\nTrump's emergency (Photo: Mike Thompson/USA TODAY)\n\nOn the other hand, the Constitution allows broader grants of discretionary authority to the president in matters relating to foreign affairs and military matters than it allows for domestic legislation. How should the Supreme Court approach the border wall? Is it a foreign policy or domestic policy?\n\nIn one sense it is a little bit of both \u2014 it is \"on the border,\" literally and figuratively. But the trumps here (pun intended), again, go against this president.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the building of a wall, on U.S. soil, with U.S. taxpayer money, requires an explicit appropriation from Congress.\n\nNo Supreme Court justice, conservative or liberal, can conscientiously believe that the framers of the Constitution ever intended that American presidents, subject to the system of divided powers and checks and balances that the Framers so ingeniously devised, could get away with such a ruse as this president's facile declaration of a national emergency.\n\nRodney Smolla is the dean of Widener University Delaware Law School. His full column first appeared in The (Wilmington, Delaware) News Journal.\n\nPolitical emergency (Photo: Adam Zyglis/The Buffalo (New York) News/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, editorial: \"Congress has granted presidents the power to declare emergencies under the 1976 National Emergencies Act, and perhaps the Supreme Court will find that delegation enough to justify President Donald Trump's declaration. As we've argued, it is not an easy constitutional call. But Trump is taking an enormous risk with presidential authority, as President Harry Truman did in nationalizing the steel industry. Trump is inviting judges to intervene in a way that could further restrict the ability of presidents to act in emergencies that are far more urgent than the current troubles at the U.S.-Mexico border.\"\n\nJudge Jeanine Pirro, FoxNews.com: \"I can't imagine that the Supreme Court would not support the declaration of an emergency given Congress' repeated failure to act and the president's repeated attempts to make the Democrats act. ... This president is on firm legal ground. Both the Constitution and Congress have given him the right to declare emergencies as an executive action.\"\n\nDouglas Schoen, The Hill: \"If Trump continues this approach of governing for his base, and his base only, his chances of re-election in 2020 will surely be diminished. Aside from the political ramifications, his national emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern border also sets a disturbing precedent for future presidents to be able to make similar declarations to deliver their own campaign promises or to reach difficult political goals.\"\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nWhy declare a national emergency now? Why not a year and 11 months ago? Why not six or 12 months ago? Simply, why? President Donald Trump and Republicans were in control for two whole years and did not see this \"emergency.\" And now, suddenly, this is all they can talk about?\n\n\u2014 Norma Gonzalez\n\nTrump is showing the way for progressive Democrats to solve the gun and climate crises. The next Democratic president can simply declare a national gun emergency to ban assault weapons or a national climate emergency to take all the necessary steps to implement the Green New Deal. Trump and the GOP forget that in Washington, what goes around comes around.\n\n\u2014 Damon Walton\n\nThe emergency at the border existed before Trump was even elected, but the recent caravans have raised the threat level, considerably.\n\n\u2014 Noura Khubzi\n\nThis move is an attack on our Constitution and the structure of government created by our Founding Fathers.

AP Domestic\n\nFormer ambassador: We're safer in NATO than outside it, but Donald Trump doesn't seem to realize that and is separating us from our closest allies.\n\nAs a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, I left the Munich Security Conference concerned that we are witnessing the most worrisome division across the Atlantic in memory.\n\nIn a dramatic weekend showdown, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Vice President Mike Pence offered strikingly opposite views about the future of NATO and the once close transatlantic relationship. Former Vice President Joe Biden spoke for many former American officials in both parties who believe that the Trump administration has needlessly weakened our ties to Europe.\n\nThe normally quiet and polite Merkel came out swinging against President Donald Trump\u2019s America First policy, charging the United States with unfair sanctions and criticism over Europe\u2019s continued participation in the Iran nuclear deal. She lamented Trump\u2019s recent decisions to back away from U.S. military commitments in Syria and Afghanistan and his aggressive trade policies toward the European Union.\n\nMerkel\u2019s criticism was echoed by many other European leaders at the conference. They believe that Trump has broken with former U.S. presidents in treating the EU as a competitor rather than a friend, his negative leadership of the NATO alliance, and his weakness in refusing to stand up to Russia\u2019s assertive president, Vladimir Putin.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the 55th Munich Security Conference on Feb. 16, 2019. (Photo: SVEN HOPPE, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTrump and his Republican minions are playing with nuclear fire on NATO and Russia\n\nChaos in Trump's White House is dangerously good news for our global adversaries\n\nAmerica is on the brink of a historic break with Europe, thanks to Trump\n\nFor two years now, Trump's advisers have told Europeans to watch what America does and not what the president says in his often intemperate and caustic tweets. But since Trump took the United States out of the Paris climate change and Iran nuclear agreements \u2014 both top priorities for European nations \u2014 support for Trump has plummeted on the continent.\n\nMerkel appears to have reached a breaking point with Trump, who has also threatened trade sanctions against German cars. She and other European leaders might be calculating that they can wait out Trump until the 2020 presidential election, when most clearly hope he will be defeated.\n\nMerkel and not America now leads the West\n\nGiven America\u2019s dominant power and commitment to democracy, each U.S. president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been considered the leader of the West. That title could now be falling more credibly to Merkel. Since Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House, she has been much more passionate and consistent in defending the institutions the United States have led in creating since World War II.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has exhibited open hostility to Europe and, unlike President Ronald Reagan, for example, has not emphasized democratic values in his foreign policy. While criticizing Merkel and other European leaders, he has at the same time embraced authoritarian leaders such as Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jung Un and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nPence and Biden in battle of US vice presidents\n\nThe overwhelming applause for Merkel\u2019s defiant speech stood in sharp contrast to the bare civility that greeted Pence. The largely European crowd of officials, journalists and think tank experts mostly failed to applaud when Pence said he brought greetings from Trump. Pence\u2019s criticism of the United Kingdom, Germany and France on Iran went over badly in the hall. He and his advisers clearly did not grasp just how much Europeans inside and outside of government dislike and oppose Trump and his go-it-alone policies.\n\nBiden spoke several hours after Pence, giving Munich attendees a rare chance to compare and contrast the two American leaders. In introducing Biden on the Munich stage, I noted his decades of support for a close U.S. relationship with Europe. Biden pledged his full support to NATO and the EU, in contrast to Trump and Pence, and pointed to polls indicating continued, strong American public backing for NATO.\n\nIn this battle of the VPs, Biden won a decisive victory as measured by the crowd\u2019s reaction. Merkel received the first standing ovation of the day. Biden, arguing it was in the self-interest of Americans to lead internationally, got the second when he concluded, \"We will be back.\u201d\n\nAmerica is stronger inside NATO than outside\n\nAnother factor in the Munich drama was the presence of the largest U.S. congressional delegation to Munich in memory \u2014 more than 50 members from both parties \u2014 whose most senior representative was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Democratic and Republican members alike reassured anxious Europeans that the United States would stand by its NATO commitments and remain a constant friend to Europe.\n\nCongress was at the center of a Harvard Kennedy School report that I and retired Army Lt. Gen. Doug Lute, both former U.S. ambassadors to NATO, presented in Munich. In \u201cNATO at 70: An Alliance in Crisis,\u201d we said Congress must block any attempt by Trump to diminish U.S. military contributions to NATO or to withdraw America from the alliance completely. We also judged that \u201cNATO\u2019s single greatest challenge is the absence of strong, principled American presidential leadership for the first time in its history.\u201d\n\nThe United States is unquestionably stronger in NATO than outside of it. The European allies came to our defense after 9/11, have fought and died with our soldiers in Afghanistan, and they are helping us to defeat the Islamic State terrorist organization. Most Americans agree Europe remains vital for the United States with the apparent exception of President Trump, whose ill-advised policies threaten to separate America from our closest allies in the world.\n\nNicholas Burns is a Harvard professor and former undersecretary of State who served presidents of both parties in his foreign service career.

USA TODAY\n\nDemocrats should consider this a wake-up call for 2020 when they must win states that don't have dynamic urban economies like New York or California.\n\nIt\u2019s a high class problem to have. A mammoth company offers to set up a gleaming new headquarters employing 25,000 people in high-wage jobs. Most localities would crawl through broken glass to land that prize, and 238 did as they bid for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. But one of the two winners, the borough of Queens in New York City, just turned it away like a diner returning a Kobe steak cooked medium instead of medium rare.\n\nIn truth, it was a joint rejection. Activists in Queens didn\u2019t want it, and Amazon wasn\u2019t about to fight for it. But this rejection exposes a real but often overlooked economic crisis in America: the concentration of opportunity. The reason 238 cities and regions bid for the Amazon headquarters is that most of America is hungry for opportunity while enough of Queens and New York City is not.\n\nTo be sure, there are people and neighborhoods in Queens thirsting for the chance to earn a good life. But all in all, we should all be lucky enough to live where opportunity is growing and not shrinking.\n\nAt an Amazon office in New York on Feb. 14, 2019. (Photo: Matthew Cossel/AP)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nAmazon played us: New York state senator\n\nTrump promised to save US workers, but he's tweeting and helping the rich instead\n\nElizabeth Warren didn't miss her presidential moment. Win or lose, 2020 is her time.\n\nAnd it is positively blooming in Queens. Between 2005 and 2015, this geographically tiny borough added more than 7,500 private sector businesses and nearly 80,000 private sector jobs.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the entire state of Michigan. Over the same decade, it lost more than 18,000 businesses and shed nearly 150,000 private sector jobs. In much of Michigan, opportunity is as scarce as it is bountiful in the five boroughs of New York. That is why community activists can throw away 25,000 jobs and people cheer in one place while much of the rest of the country is shouting \u201cchoose me.\u201d\n\nDynamic urban economies aren't typical\n\nThis opportunity crisis has also become a political crisis for Democrats, because the three states that make up the heart of Democrats\u2019 electoral and donor base \u2014 California, Massachusetts and New York \u2014 are dominated by urban economies so dynamic and powerful that they are out of step with much of the country.\n\nCompare the trajectories of these three Blue Bubble states with the so-called Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which had voted Democratic in every election since 1992 until they flipped to Donald Trump and delivered him the White House in 2016.\n\nThe Blue Bubble states added more than 1.2 million jobs over this 10-year period as the Blue Wall states added just north of 50,000 jobs, essentially treading water. That\u2019s not much more than the number of jobs that Queens just cavalierly rejected.\n\nSpread opportunity to forgotten places\n\nAnd that poses a conundrum for Democrats, who need to reconcile these differences with their policy preferences and narrative. For example, while income inequality is a legitimate economic and moral concern, in America it fits the Blue Bubble more than the Blue Wall. In fact, in the Blue Wall states where opportunity is scarce and jobs are precious, this fixation sounds like a stodgy academic debate in the faculty lounge of an Ivy League college \u2014 not the kitchen-table economics that political parties strive for.\n\nWhat leaders of most states desperately want is an assurance that opportunity will not bypass their urban, suburban and rural areas. Democrats should fight to make sure that those who have been denied equal opportunities \u2014 women and minorities \u2014 have more opportunity to earn the life they hope for. And Democrats should talk about the myriad ways to spread opportunity to the places the digital economy has forgotten.\n\nThis could lead to a Democratic message and agenda that pave the path to winning in Queens, in Flint and throughout the country.\n\nJim Kessler is executive vice president of Third Way, and Gabe Horwitz is senior vice president for the Third Way economic program.

The Denver strike was resolved after three days, but it\u2019s likely that this is just the beginning of teacher activism in 2019. Teachers in California, West Virginia and Virginia are gearing up to fight. As the legislative season gets rolling, teacher pay and education funding are hot topics in statehouses across the country.\n\nGiven all this it would be easy to believe, as many do, that America\u2019s schools are starved of funding. But that argument doesn\u2019t fully match the data. While there is variation across states, school funding has increased dramatically over the past 40 years.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, inflation-adjusted per-pupil spending on public education has more than doubled since the 1970s. So why all the unrest? To answer that, we need to take a look at how all that new money has been spent.\n\nIn Denver on Feb. 11, 2019. (Photo: David Zalubowski/AP)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nAs US teachers ramp up pressure, face reality: L.A. strike was about control, not students\n\nLos Angeles teacher: Our strike was worth it to help students and improve schools\n\nI teach eighth-graders math during the day. At night, I wash my poorest students' clothes.\n\nThe first part of the answer is that U.S. public schools have added large numbers of instructional, administrative and support staff over the past four decades. Teacher-student ratios have decreased from 22 to 1 in 1970 to about 16 to 1 today. And since 2000, the number of public school administrators has increased more than five times faster than student enrollment, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by labor leaders.\n\nIn his letter announcing the strike, Denver Classroom Teachers Association President Henry Roman wrote, \u201cDPS has made its choice to keep critical funding in central administration, and not to apply more of those funds to the classroom where they would provide the greatest benefit for student learning.\u201d\n\nAs part of the deal to end the strike in Denver, the district agreed to cut 150 administrative positions and eliminate large administrator bonuses.\n\nTeachers who made up about 60 percent of all public school staff in 1970 now make up less than half, despite there being more than a million more teachers in today\u2019s classrooms. More employees means that the budget pie is divided more times, leaving fewer dollars for each individual teacher\u2019s pay.\n\nMoney is going toward paying down debt now\n\nAt the same time, rising benefits costs are squeezing school budgets nationwide. While average inflation-adjusted teacher salaries have been relatively stagnant since 1990, benefits costs have risen from 16.8 percent of expenditures in 1990 to 23 percent of today\u2019s much larger expenditure base.\n\nMore recently, the growth of retirement costs \u2014 in particular, payments to cover unfunded benefits earned by teachers for past service \u2014 has placed pressure on school budgets. Almost every state increased teachers\u2019 retirement benefits in the booming 1990s. But the additional promises were not accompanied by responsible funding plans. Overfunded at the turn of the millennium, by 2003, teacher pension plans were collectively short by $235 billion. By 2009, pension debt had more than doubled, to $584 billion.\n\nThe strong bull market since the Great Recession has not put a dent in the shortfall, which now totals well more than $600 billion. As a result of pension-funding shortfalls, retirement costs per pupil have more than doubled since 2004, from about $530 to more than $1,300 today.\n\nRetirement costs now exceed 10 percent of all education expenditures on average across the country. Unfortunately, the majority of these contributions do not benefit teachers in today\u2019s classrooms because roughly 70 percent of retirement contributions are going to pay down debt rather than for new benefits.\n\nGrowing retirement costs for these legacy-benefit promises pose a challenge for many school districts to maintain their current level of services, much less to hire new teachers and support staff or give high-quality teachers a pay raise.\n\nWhat protected teachers once is a danger now\n\nRising benefits costs are a big part of the L.A. school district\u2019s budget woes, limiting funds available to meet the demands of the teachers\u2019 union for more pay and support staff. That helps explain why teachers there settled for little more than was on the bargaining table when they chose to strike.\n\nWhile the L.A. district has a $1.8 billion budget surplus today, it\u2019s burning through it at an alarming rate, and rising benefits costs are much to blame. By the 2031-32 school year, the district expects to spend more than 50 percent of its budget on health care and pensions.\n\nEven in Texas, considered by many to be a bastion of fiscal conservatism, pension debt has ballooned. The state and school districts now owe the Teacher Retirement System $46.2 billion in benefits that teachers have already earned, a total that is roughly equivalent to all of the state\u2019s other debt combined.\n\nTo be sure, there is no immediate national \u201ccrisis,\u201d insofar as most teacher pension plans are not on the brink of failure. But it\u2019s clear that the rising cost of benefits that were meant to protect teachers is now endangering teacher pay and larger school funding in a way that was never anticipated. Indeed, school districts will likely be seeing red for some time \u2014 both at rallies and in their budgets.\n\nJosh B.

Both sides have argued our communities are crumbling amidst economic despair, the American dream is dead, identity politics fuels an ugly populism on the other side, and loneliness is an epidemic because of all these things.\n\nActual Americans are not so gloomy. According to a nationally representative survey that my American Enterprise Institute colleagues and I have conducted, America is doing better than it thinks it is.\n\nPeople are actually pretty happy with life in their communities. They think things are looking up for them, even if they think things are looking down for the country as a whole.\n\nFor instance, identity politics is overblown. Seventy-five percent of Americans derive a sense of community from the city where they live, compared with 64 percent who cite their political ideology and 58 percent their ethnic identity.

Nearly three-quarters of Americans are satisfied to some degree with how things are going in our local communities, compared with just 43 percent who feel the same about the country. Eight in 10 Americans rate their communities as good or excellent places to live.\n\nNone of this means things are perfect. There are real differences by race and income in how satisfied people are with their neighborhoods, but majorities \u2014 and often significant majorities \u2014 in every demographic category are satisfied with their communities.\n\nIn reality, our lives are about much more than the \u201cnational conversations\u201d in which we participate on social media. We go to work, run errands, pick the kids up from school, hang out at the bar with friends, and go to yoga classes and Bible studies. There is a lot of togetherness in America that we overlook while savaging each other on social media and shouting at the television.\n\nAmericans get along pretty well with each other\n\nWe actually get along pretty well with each other. At least 74 percent of people in every racial, income and age group in America say those in their neighborhood get along fairly well or very well. Fifty-one percent of Americans talk to their neighbors at least a few times a week. Only 37 percent report helping neighbors with something a few times a month or more, but 75 percent say they live in a community in which people are willing to help out if needed.\n\nWhat about the loneliness epidemic we keep hearing about? On average, according to an index we created from our survey data, Americans are more sociable than isolated. To be sure, one-third of Americans report feeling lonely sometimes. But nearly three-quarters of those who feel lonely also say they have someone they are close to, and 61 percent of people who report feelings of isolation also report having a lot in common with those around them.\n\nCommentators have identified a loneliness crisis in America going back at least 60 years, and while genuine social isolation is indeed harmful, it is less clear whether it is an epidemic and has been getting worse over time.\n\nThe American dream is doing well, too\n\nThe American dream is also alive and well, contrary to the obituaries many have written about it lately. Eight in 10 Americans in every racial group believe they have achieved the American dream or are on the way to doing so.\n\nWhen asked what is essential to achieve the dream, 85 percent of Americans say being free to choose how to live their lives, and 83 percent say having a fulfilling family life. Only 59 percent say owning a home and 49 percent say having a successful career are essential to the American dream. Freedom and family trump the more conventional materialistic versions of the dream we often talk about.\n\nWhat kinds of things foster neighborliness and community well-being? Our survey finds that regularly talking to neighbors and helping them out, participating in a house of worship, walking your dog, and being fairly close to amenities such as grocery stores, parks and libraries are associated with greater sociability, less loneliness, and community satisfaction.\n\nPartisanship divides us bitterly when talking about the direction of the country, but it plays almost no role in how people feel about their communities and whether they are lonely or achieving the dream.\n\nThe next time people online tell you to be mad about how things are going, ask yourself whether what they are saying is true about you.

I reject Perry\u2019s notion that appreciation for buttock shape is a new phenomenon.\n\nRegarding the safety of the procedure, the task force cited by Perry has indeed found that the BBL can safely be performed by limiting the grafted fat to the subcutaneous space. However, Perry goes on to claim that it is \u201cimpossible to follow\u201d this guideline intraoperatively.

It is worth acknowledging the experience of all people, but this column does more to invalidate the experiences of the vast majority of trans people, as opposed to validate the story of someone else.\n\nAs a trans woman who felt early in my path like I had to justify my transition to society, family and friends, running a piece noting the experience of someone who makes up a small minority of the trans population without noting that person\u2019s opinion may not be representative is incredibly irresponsible. Individuals should absolutely carefully consider the pros and cons of transitioning, given the potential disruption to life it can cause, (not to mention the time and money involved) and should know that a number of people greater than zero regret that decision, which is the case with any major life decision (moving somewhere new, starting a new career, etc.).\n\nRelated: As a transgender woman, I can't fight Trump's policies by myself. I need all progressives to join us.\n\nHowever, a piece like this is simply going to provide unsubstantiated malice to parents, employers, friends and people in contact with trans individuals looking for an excuse to prevent someone from transitioning to justify his/her own bigotry and/or fear or to invalidate that person\u2019s feelings and experiences.\n\nThe media does provide stories more often about successful gender transitions, because those are more common than regrets. In addition, when transgender people are still regularly persecuted (such as the proposal last fall from the federal government to remove mention of \u201ctransgender\u201d from policy documents; regular hate crimes against transgender people; adverse employment and housing determinations), it\u2019s more important than ever that we be given a positive, fair and accurate portrayal by the media to try and balance out the negativity we otherwise face on a day to day basis.

She tacitly admits that there is no identified problem of vapor advertising on TV, calling for \u201cstudying the extent of advertising on the airwaves for e-cigarettes.\u201d If the problem she points to existed, she wouldn\u2019t need the FCC to study the \u201cextent\u201d of it.\n\nIf Rosenworcel really believes there is a plague of vapor ads blanketing the airwaves, she should study and quantify the problem before she puts pen to paper.

Additionally, a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that VA appointment wait times are shorter than those in the private sector in primary care and two of three specialty care areas. The JAMA study also found that access to care at VA health centers improved from 2014 to 2017 and patient satisfaction with VA appointment wait times is improving.\n\nRelated: Where every VA hospital lags or leads other medical care\n\nIn other words, VA care is just as good \u2014 or better \u2014 than that available in the private sector.

She put her job and her professional future at risk in order to trick the Anthem Blue Cross insurance corporation into helping an impoverished child with the symptoms of strep throat.\n\nCan she come be the superintendent of my school district? It would be a novel undertaking for us to have a super who cared that much about children.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nI teach eighth-graders math during the day. At night, I wash my poorest students' clothes.\n\nMy special needs students needed their teachers in the classroom \u2014 not on the picket line\n\nMy daughter's teacher is on strike. As a mom, I stand on the picket line with her.\n\nSmitherman said she used poor judgement in using her son\u2019s medical insurance card for the uninsured 15-year-old student, and no one disagrees with her on that account. She has now been compelled to walk away from her nearly $120,000-a-year job over a medical bill of just $233.\n\nHelping kids isn't in the job description\n\nWhat she should have done, of course, was mind her own business. Leave it to the child\u2019s guardians and, if they were unable or unwilling to get him medical treatment, so be it.\n\nThat is what she was supposed to do. Run the school district \u2014 make sure that everyone gets paid on time, that there is enough toilet paper and paper towels in the buildings, that the attendance is submitted promptly, that every other institutional necessity gets satisfied, and then go home and forget about the general welfare of those kids. Maybe convene a blue-ribbon panel to study why students are missing school or why they are getting sick and not getting better and falling asleep from exhaustion at their desks. But don\u2019t get personally involved. Don\u2019t go buying an impoverished kid clothes or taking him to see a doctor.\n\nA Madison County, Indiana sheriff's department mugshot of Casey Smitherman, superintendent of Elwood Community Schools who allegedly used her insurance to help a sick student receive treatment. January 2019. (Photo: Madison County Sheriff's Department via sheriffofmadisoncounty.com)\n\nCaring about what happens to students outside of school isn't in Smitherman's job description.\n\nAnd, even if she suffered from the educator\u2019s character flaw of caring too much about other people\u2019s children, she should have just paid the kid\u2019s medical and pharmacy bill out of her own pocket. That\u2019s the way it works.\n\nIf a student in your classroom or in your building faints from hunger because she or he is only eating whatever the school is serving, look the other way or else give the kid a fast-food gift card. You think anyone else is going to do it? That kid is invisible to the rest of the world, but you see the suffering so it\u2019s on you. It doesn\u2019t say that in the contract, but it doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nSchool systems run by rules, not sense\n\nBut, seriously, can Smitherman come work for my school district? I wouldn\u2019t mind working for a superintendent who was sympathetic to the ways some of us find ourselves breaking the rules on behalf of our students.\n\nLike when you\u2019re driving home late at night after a basketball game and there\u2019s one of the players, a 14-year-old kid, sitting at a bus stop on a dangerous street. The rules say not to ever have a student in your car without written permission from the parents, but you can\u2019t keep driving and leave him there. So you park and sit with him, waiting for the bus but fearing for your own safety.\n\nOr you\u2019re on a field trip and one of your students gets caught shoplifting and you know that if this kid gets charged her uncle, whom she lives with, will pull her out of school and send her to the produce fields north of the city to do stoop labor with her mother. So you plead with the shopkeeper, and when that doesn\u2019t work you offer him $20. Or you commit fraud against an insurance company or, in my case, against the very school district that employed me.\n\nA classroom. (Photo: DONGSEON_KIM, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThis is what I did in my first year as a teacher. Toward the end of the school year, my principal asked me to help her spend some money, explaining that the school would be docked next year if we left any funds unspent. This included about $2,000 in \u201clibrary funds,\u201d though our school had no library and no place to put library books.\n\nThis was back in the early 1990s, and our school did not have a single computer. Among the items eligible to be purchased was computer software but not, I noticed, computers. I called an official to protest this (what does one do with software without a computer?) but got nowhere, so I went to a local computer store and asked the proprietor to write up a purchase for software and instead give our school computers.\n\nMost of our students lived below the poverty line and had never used a computer before, and the opportunity was transformative for them.\n\nI was young and idealistic, and I remember hoping the fraud did get exposed so that I could go before the school board or whoever might dare to discipline me and tell them that they were the criminals. That the system was a fraud and that wasted funds were stolen money. I was going to let them have it and they would listen because I cared about students and they didn\u2019t.\n\nWhat an idiot I was \u2014 and a lucky idiot for never getting caught.\n\nSchool systems \u2014 and, for that matter, health care systems \u2014 don\u2019t care how stupid or heartless or immoral they are. All they know how to do is grind on and grind up people like Casey Smitherman.\n\nLarry Strauss has taught high school English in South Los Angeles since 1992.

President Trump rejected that deal, calling it a \u201cgiant amnesty.\u201d\n\nThe deal the president agreed to this week to avert a second government shutdown allocated just $1.4 billion for a border fence, not enough to make much progress. And he has now declared a national emergency in order to fund more of the long-promised wall. A court challenge to his declaration is a near-certainty.\n\nDuring his press conference announcing the national emergency, President Trump said, \u201cI would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe that\u2019s something we can all work on.\u201d If President Trump is truly interested in forging a real immigration deal anytime in the next two years, or just wants a better solution than a national emergency, I hope he will consider the ancient parable of the Long Spoons.\n\nA man asks an angel for a preview of heaven and hell. The angel takes the man to a banquet full of delicious food but the people are starving because they each have three-foot-long spoons strapped to their arms and can\u2019t get food in their mouths. This is hell. Then the angel takes the man to visit a similar banquet with one difference: everyone is full and happy because they are using the spoons to feed one another. This is heaven; and Washington has never seemed so far away from it.\n\nTrump says, \u201cdeals are my art form,\u201d but he\u2019s repeatedly failed to strike deals with Congress, especially on immigration, for a simple reason: He thinks every deal requires a victor and a vanquished. He can\u2019t imagine a win-win deal where both sides feed the other, once saying his approach to negotiation is, \u201cIt\u2019s give and take. But it\u2019s gotta mostly be take.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at the State of the Union address on Feb. 15, 2019. (Photo: Pool photo by Doug Mills)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nEl Paso mayor: Despite Trump's State of the Union claim, our relations with Mexico thrive\n\nDonald Trump caved to Nancy Pelosi on shutdown, now the wall will never be built\n\nDemocrats and Republicans flip all the time on border security. This was a fabricated shutdown.\n\nTrump probably thinks this attitude will continue to serve him well because he always had the option to walk away from the table during his business career. If his brinkmanship, hyperbole and histrionics didn\u2019t get him what he wanted from a developer, a contractor or a bank, he could go searching for another deal partner.\n\nBut in Washington, partners are more defined and roles more established. There is but one table and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is sitting on the other side of it for the next two years holding the purse strings. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is not about to step into the middle of this food fight.\n\nTransactional leadership needs mutual benefit\n\nForty years ago, the political scientist James McGregor Burns described two distinct leadership styles in presidents: transformational (think FDR and Reagan) and transactional (think LBJ). President Trump is quite obviously the latter. Real estate is a transactional business, Trump was very good at it, and no one should expect him to fundamentally change his stripes.\n\nBut transactional leadership can work if the practitioner recognizes when the Long Spoons are needed and the necessity of mutual benefit in a particular negotiation.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson was described by his biographer Robert Caro as \u201ca mixture of bootlicker and bully.\u201d He was crude, egotistical, ruthless and even accused of stealing his 1948 Senate election. And yet, Johnson also had an exquisite understanding of what it took to persuade. Hubert Humphrey remarked that Johnson \u201cknew how to appeal to every single senator and how to win them over.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s approach worked. He signed into law the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and Medicare in 1965, with large enough majorities supporting him that these bills became the law of the land unquestionably, even though many legislators began the negotiations on each bill implacably opposed to him.\n\nIt\u2019s na\u00efve to expect a similar turn of events now. But it is possible \u2014 and essential \u2014 for President Trump, Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats to change their negotiating posture from one of mutual and escalating antagonism to mutual benefit.\n\nA tangible legislative achievement is possible\n\nSince late last year, the negotiations to avert one shutdown, and now avert the threat of a second one, have followed a tired and familiar script:\n\nPresident Trump: \u201cI want a border wall.\u201d\n\nNancy Pelosi: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a border wall.\u201d\n\nRecriminations follow. Rinse and repeat.\n\nIf what both sides of this debate want most is to destroy one another at the expense of the public good, then there really is no way out. But if what they most want is a tangible legislative achievement, it is there for the taking.\n\nDemocrats have lately taken to calling President Trump\u2019s border wall \u201cimmoral.\u201d But just a year ago, they were willing to fund it \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t like it \u2013 if President Trump would go big on the Dreamers.\n\nTo date, President Trump has only been willing to offer temporary extensions to the 800,000 Dreamers in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) implemented under President Obama.\n\nSo Mr. President, here\u2019s an idea. Harness the wisdom of the long spoons. Let the kids stay by offering Democrats a path to citizenship for law-abiding Dreamers in exchange for real money for the wall. Dreamers, on average, came to this country when they were six; America is the only home most of them have ever known \u2014 97 percent of them are working or in school and 900 of them are serving in our military. The immigration restrictionists on the right won\u2019t like a Dreamer deal, but as poll after poll shows, the vast majority of the American people will be with you.\n\nA Dreamers-for-border-security deal might not get us to heaven. But after the political hell Americans have been enduring, most of us will at least see it as a path away from purgatory.\n\nAndrew Tisch is the co-chairman of Loews Corporation and a cofounder of the national political reform group No Labels.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

She was my world, she was my wife\u2019s best friend and, most importantly, she was my baby girl.\n\nOn the morning of November 22, 2018 \u2014 Thanksgiving Day \u2014 a man who should never have been in our country drank several beers before getting behind the wheel of a car. He blew through two red lights at an intersection, killed my daughter, and changed our lives forever.\n\nSurveillance footage shows that Mandy was using a crosswalk as she crossed the street. A witness described the sound of the impact as being so loud that he thought two vehicles had collided, not that a human being was struck. My daughter died on the spot.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nDonald Trump's emergency declaration is an attack on democracy\n\nMy son was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Neither he nor Mollie Tibbetts deserved to die.\n\nEl Paso mayor: Despite Trump's State of the Union claim, our relations with Mexico thrive\n\nThe man, Joel Velazquez, didn\u2019t even stop to render aid. He kept driving, then abandoned the vehicle and lied to the police, telling them his vehicle had been stolen to try to avoid being arrested.\n\nEventually, Velazquez admitted the truth.\n\nImmigration laws must be enforced\n\nMandy was so badly injured that the police initially wouldn't let me see her body. We were eventually told that her legs were broken in multiple places and she had multiple skull fractures and broken ribs. My beautiful daughter, torn to pieces. That\u2019s something my family and I have to live with every single day.\n\nTo makes things worse, shortly after Mandy\u2019s funeral, we learned that the man who killed my daughter not only has an apparently criminal past, but was also in the country illegally.\n\nDan Ferguson with his daughter, Mandy, at her wedding on June 21, 2014, in El Paso, Texas. (Photo: Family handout)\n\nHe was arrested in 2017 on suspicion of assault, but a judge released him on bond. When Mandy was killed, Velazquez was still out on bond and his assault case was pending in district court. Now, he\u2019s been charged with manslaughter in the accident involving my daughter\u2019s death and tampering with evidence.\n\nUnfortunately, cities like El Paso don\u2019t enthusiastically support voluntarily assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in identifying criminal illegal immigrants. In the past, El Paso\u2019s City Council has unanimously voted to challenge Texas\u2019 legal ban on sanctuary cities. There are in fact hundreds of sanctuary jurisdictions around the country. How many cases are there similar to my daughter\u2019s death?\n\nI have never been an especially political person, but Mandy is the reason I attended President Trump's rally in El Paso Monday night, and she is why I\u2019m with the president 100 percent on the need for effective border security, including building a wall along the vulnerable areas on our southern border. The president was right to declare our border crisis a national emergency. While the vast majority of illegal immigrants are not violent criminals, they have all violated the laws which are in place to keep the American people safe.\n\nPartisan bickering costs American lives\n\nIn the same city and at the same time that Trump was standing up for immigration enforcement, former Representative Robert O\u2019Rourke, who was my congressman the day Mandy was killed, led an anti-wall rally. Days later, when O'Rourke was asked if he'd tear down the border wall separating El Paso, Texas, from Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, he said, \"Yes, absolutely. I'd take the wall down.\" Ju\u00e1rez is the birthplace of the man who killed Mandy.\n\nO'Rourke called his anti-wall the \u201cMarch for Truth\u201d. This is the truth: When our laws are broken, there are consequences, not just for the victims of crimes but also for the victims\u2019 families. Mandy would not have been killed Thanksgiving morning by an illegal immigrant with a history of arrest if our immigration laws were enforced as they are written.\n\nAfter Mandy was killed, O\u2019Rourke never bothered to reach out to my family; yet by welcoming my family and me as special guests to his rally, President Trump has given me the platform to ensure that Mandy didn\u2019t die in vain. It won\u2019t bring Mandy back, but it might prevent this from happening in the future.\n\nI hope the president\u2019s efforts will convince Congress to finally do what is necessary to secure America\u2019s borders, before another parent has to bury his or her child because partisan bickering kept politicians from doing what\u2019s right to secure the safety of the American people.\n\nDan Ferguson is a retired educator and lives in El Paso, Texas.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Our shared faith that God would heal our hearts and help us rebuild our lives knit our hearts together in love and allowed us to experience \"the peace of God, which passeth all understanding\" (Philippians 4:7). We flew home sobered by what we had seen but also inspired by the goodness of so many.

Faith in God is, and has always been, the pre-eminent force for good in this world. It is the most enduring source of peace for minds and hearts.\n\nWhat we experienced in Paradise, with men and women whose hearts were open to God, stands in stark contrast to much of what we see in the world today. I fear that many are standing on the edge of a spiritual and emotional precipice. Not long ago, belief in God was a given and expressions of faith the norm.\n\nBut in recent years, we have experienced a shift from a world in which it seemed impossible not to believe in God to one in which faith is simply an option \u2014 and far too often subject to ridicule.\n\nHumans were made to seek meaning\n\nWhen God is removed from our collective conscience, there are sobering ramifications.

Nelson in Salt Lake City on Jan. 16, 2018. (Photo: Rick Bowmer/AP)\n\nWorking alongside brilliant minds (there and elsewhere) was exhilarating. But human intelligence has its limits. As a surgeon, I repaired hundreds of hearts. But my skills could not heal heartache, or erase grief, or salve emotional wounds. Nothing man-made can ever approach what God can do for His children.\n\nThe most able minds cannot offer redemption from sin or heal our hearts from emotional pain. They cannot generate enduring hope or joy. They cannot promise life after death or the potential of being with our loved ones beyond the grave. They cannot generate peace of mind.\n\nBut God can. Our spiritual DNA is His DNA. If our hearts are open to Him \u2014 if we believe in the divinity of the Father and His Son \u2014 we can rise from the ashes of our lives and become the men and women we were sent to earth to become.\n\nOnly He knows how to repair hearts\n\nAfter three decades of doing cardiac surgery around the world, I thought I knew a little something about repairing hearts. Then I was called as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. In that moment, my focus shifted instantly to healing hearts another way \u2014 by turning all who will listen to the Master Healer, Jesus the Christ.\n\nFor the last 35 years, I have traveled the world, meeting with millions of men and women in more than 130 countries. I've witnessed the effects of poverty and wealth, seen the impact of education and the lack thereof, met the high in station and the humblest of souls, and been gratified by humanitarian outreach from so many who care deeply about the human condition \u2014 including the Church I now have the privilege of leading.\n\nBut the most profound thing I\u2019ve witnessed is the unrivaled difference that belief in God and His Son, Jesus Christ, has in a person's life. There is simply nothing to compare with the refining, ennobling strength and meaning that come into the life of a devoted believer and servant.\n\nThis is not to suggest that faith in God eliminates challenges. It does not. We will all experience the vicissitudes of life.\n\nFinancial stress, ill health, fractured relationships and dreams, personal loss, unfairness at the hands of conspiring men and women \u2014 each of these can fill our hearts with anxiety and fear.\n\nBut it is my conviction that our Savior can strengthen and enable us to reach our highest highs and be able to cope with our lowest lows. As an ordained Apostle of Jesus Christ, I invite you to seek to know for yourself that He is the Master Healer. He has the capacity to heal you from sin and sadness, from despair and heartache. I saw this healing balm among the people of Paradise, and I have felt it personally again and again, including recently in the passing of our precious daughter.\n\nWhatever your faith tradition or personal circumstances, as a servant of the Lord, I invite you to look to Him and make Him the center of your life. Pour out your heart to God and ask Him for His help. He will infuse your life with meaning and fill your heart with hope that transcends anything the world can offer.\n\nRussell M.

Fifteen years later, he owns his own marijuana business. USA TODAY\n\nFourth-generation Oakland native Tucky Blunt grew up around weed. His grandmother used it. So did his parents and his friends.\n\nBlunt (yes, that's his real last name) started selling to friends in the neighborhood when he was 16. He was usually careful, buying in bulk from a trusted supplier and selling to customers who'd call him to meet up.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of illegal sales, it was $80 worth of pot that got him in trouble. He was found with a handful of baggies stashed in his pants when police officers came for him, tipped off by someone Blunt thought was a friend.\n\n\"We were out there trying to make money to help support our families at a time when people didn't have a lot money. We didn't think we were hurting anyone,\" said Blunt, now 39. \"I liked weed. I knew people who liked weed. Why not facilitate them getting good weed? That's how I looked at it.\"\n\nHis arrest in 2004 and his conviction left Blunt with a 10-year felony probation, allowing police to stop and search him anytime, for any reason. Meanwhile, all around Oakland, young black men like him were getting arrested while most of the white guys who were selling weed were left alone.\n\nAlphonso \"Tucky\" Blunt, 39, is photographed at his marijuana dispensary, Blunts and Moore in Oakland, California. (Photo: Martin E. Klimek, USA TODAY)\n\n\"It affected everybody in my circle because it was only targeted to us. I knew white people that was selling weed that never went to jail,\" Blunt said. \"The war on drugs was just about putting as many of us in jail as possible. It tore up a lot of families.\"\n\nThe war on drugs has for decades disproportionately devastated minority communities by punishing people like Blunt and creating a cycle of poverty, incarceration and limited employment options, legal and social justice experts say.\n\nNow, lawmakers and legalization advocates across the country are demanding not just cannabis legalization but remedies to address decades of demonstrably racist policing, from laws that automatically expunge criminal records for marijuana dealing and possession to policies that would give minority communities assistance in building cannabis businesses.\n\nThe same year as Blunt's arrest, Oakland's voters ordered police officers to make marijuana enforcement their lowest priority, below even jaywalking. But a decade later, the problem was laid bare: Officers were still arresting black men for marijuana crimes at rates staggeringly higher than for whites.\n\nAccording to the city's own statistics, 77 percent of the marijuana arrests in Oakland in 2015 were of African-Americans. Whites represented just 4 percent of those arrests, even though the city\u2019s population is about 30 percent white and 30 percent black.\n\nDetail of marijuana flower at the marijuana dispensary, Blunts and Moore. (Photo: Martin E. Klimek, USA TODAY)\n\nSimilar data have been reported throughout the U.S. While marijuana legalization has reduced the overall number of marijuana arrests, people of color are still being targeted by police.\n\nEven in states with largely white populations, black people using or selling marijuana still face high arrest rates.\n\nIn Colorado, which in 2012 became the first state to legalize marijuana, the total number of marijuana arrests decreased by 52 percent between 2012 and 2017, from 12,709 to 6,153, according to state statistics. But at the same time, the marijuana arrest rate for African-Americans \u2013 233 per 100,000 \u2013 was nearly double that of whites in 2017, and that's in a state that's 84 percent white.\n\nIn Alaska, of the 17 marijuana arrests in 2016, 29 percent were of African-Americans, even though they represent just 4 percent of the state\u2019s population, making Alaska\u2019s marijuana arrest rate for African-Americans nearly 10 times higher than that of whites. The state made recreational marijuana legal in 2014.\n\nAnd in Washington, D.C., where marijuana is legal, a black person is 11 times more likely than a white person to be arrested for public consumption of marijuana, according to Metropolitan Police Department statistics.\n\nHealth statistics show that whites and African-Americans use marijuana at roughly equivalent rates, which means the disparity in arrests is driven not by use but by police.\n\nYears of 'discriminatory enforcement'\n\nCalifornia has taken the lead in trying to amend years of racist drug policies.\n\nIn 2016, the state approved legal recreational marijuana in a ballot measure that also allowed people with pot arrests to get their records expunged. So few people took advantage of the opportunity, however, that state lawmakers passed a new law last fall ordering prosecutors to automatically review and potentially reduce or dismiss sentences and records for low-level marijuana offenses. It's the first statewide law of its kind.\n\nThough such efforts have the potential to make a difference, advocates say, it would have been better to include, from the very start, automatic expungement and other provisions to aid minority communities.\n\n\"Once the train has left the station, it's hard to attach new boxcars,\" said Christine De La Rosa, who owns marijuana businesses in California and Oregon and is lobbying to pass legal recreational pot in New York state. \"People are starting to understand and to put the pieces together: This child's father has been in jail for 16 years on a minor possession charge, and then right across the street at the marijuana convention you have a bunch of white guys in ties getting rich.\"\n\nSimilar debates over social justice reform and marijuana laws are unfolding in cities and states with legal marijuana and those without it. In Seattle, prosecutors have sought to abolish hundreds of convictions against people arrested with small amounts of pot. In New Jersey and New York, lawmakers are looking to legalize pot and expunge marijuana records once they do.\n\nInterior of Blunts and Moore, a marijuana dispensary in Oakland. (Photo: Martin E. Klimek, USA TODAY)\n\nIn Baltimore, State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby argues that police and prosecutor resources are better spent focusing on the city's extraordinarily high murder rate than on marijuana cases. Last month, Mosby announced that her office would no longer prosecute any marijuana possession cases, regardless of amount or prior criminal record, unless there was demonstrated intent to distribute. And she announced her office would vacate about 5,000 marijuana-related convictions dating back to 2011.\n\nMaryland decriminalized possession in 2014, but police still can and do issue citations. In a white paper released by her office, Mosby said that of the 431 marijuana citations issued by Baltimore police in 2017, 95 percent of them went to African-Americans, even though the city is roughly 60 percent black and 30 percent white. And of those citations, more than 40 percent were issued in one majority-black neighborhood.\n\nDrug laws have been \"disproportionately enforced in communities of color, and that's creating an erosion of public trust,\" Mosby told USA TODAY. \"We're moving toward legalization, and it makes absolutely no sense as the top prosecutor to be complicit in that discriminatory enforcement.\"\n\nAs a prosecutor, Mosby said, she's all too aware of how a criminal record can hurt someone for decades, even generations. In Baltimore, even though simple marijuana possession is a civil infraction, someone caught with a little bit of cannabis but without an ID can be arrested and booked, which turns the civil case into a criminal one.\n\n\"When you think about those collateral consequences, it's got impacts on housing, employment, adoption, mobility, property rights,\" Mosby said. \"It's a greater realization that these failed policies did not work and we need to take a different approach.\"\n\nWho gets to sell legal marijuana\n\nKevin Sabet, CEO of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said states should decriminalize marijuana and provide drug treatment rather than punishing users.\n\nThat could help lots of Americans targeted by the war on drugs. But he doubts it will help people who have been shut out of the legal weed industry because of their records. His group argues that the licensing systems created to sell marijuana are primarily benefiting companies racing to become the next Big Tobacco.\n\n\"The pot industry is largely rich, white, male, and despite lip service by some legalization advocates, this won\u2019t change anytime soon,\" he said. \"The pot industry requires major institutional capital, and unless a state is handing out seven-figure checks to certain populations, license preference programs won\u2019t make a dent.\"\n\nTo understand how this situation occurred, you first have to understand not just the laws governing marijuana legalization, but the regulations implementing the stores and licenses.\n\nIn general, the first states that legalized recreational marijuana made it hard for anyone with a criminal record to enter the marijuana business and gave preference to people already operating medical marijuana businesses, which were in many cases subject to even tougher licensing laws because those stores came first, when regulators were at their wariest.\n\nAnd because small-business loans are usually reserved for people without drug convictions, an arrest for simple possession also shut many would-be entrepreneurs out of now-legal cannabis business opportunities.\n\nThe end result? Tech workers, real estate investors and guys who owned construction companies have been the market leaders for years now, joined increasingly by white politicians like former House Speaker John Boehner, who backed the war on drugs and then, after leaving office, joined the board of a cannabis company in April 2018.\n\nA first-of-its kind survey by Marijuana Business Daily in 2017 found that whites made up 81 percent of people who had either started a marijuana company or had an ownership stake. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, cited those statistics at a hearing this month, suggesting that most marijuana legalization systems were actually compounding the racial wealth gap.\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to money in the bank, time and community support,\u201d said Adam Powers, who with his twin brother, Andrew, has worked in dispensaries and as cannabis consultants in Washington state. The Powers brothers, who are African-American, say they frequently deal with marijuana store owners looking to launch stores the pair compare to a Starbucks experience: non-threatening, consistent and accessible. And bland.\n\n\"From a logical standpoint, I can agree with it,\" Powers said. \"You make the industry super-hard to get into, that only people who are squeaky clean can get into it, because you know all eyes are on you. However, that is the approach always, always, that you take to whitewash things and make it clean. That's literally what you say before you fire the black people and the minorities.\"\n\nPowers, 31, said social justice was a clear motivating factor for many voters who supported legalization in Washington; they just didn't realize that legalizing pot sales wouldn't immediately right decades of wrongs.\n\n\"My life as a minority is a little bit easier knowing, hoping, that's one less reason for someone to bug me over something I use medically or recreationally, like alcohol,\" he said.\n\nFears of being targeted by police \u2013 especially federal law enforcement \u2013 kept many African-Americans without arrest records from immediately joining the semi-legal cannabis industry in its early days. For them, waiting to see how things shook out just made sense.\n\nActor and pot entrepreneur Whoopi Goldberg took a different approach. A longtime advocate for both racial equality and marijuana legalization, Goldberg, 63, co-founded a medical marijuana company in 2016, counting on her celebrity and age to insulate her from the unfair policing faced by young black men, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at who is in jail for marijuana, it kind of explains it all,\u201d she said. \u201cBlack folks with marijuana went to jail a lot more than white folks with marijuana. I think it\u2019s always been guy-oriented, and in particular white guys, because they could get away with it.\u201d\n\nHelping drug dealers go legal\n\nFor many marijuana legalization activists, it's now up to local governments to diversify the legal pot industry by clearing conviction records and handing out subsidies. If white men have unfairly benefited from marijuana legalization, then it's only fair that minority communities be given extra help now because they suffered more, the thinking goes.\n\n\"We actually do have to overcorrect,\" said Kassandra Frederique, 32, the New York state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which is lobbying to legalize marijuana in the Empire State. \"People from our communities, black and brown communities, were the one first ones to be criminalized. Why shouldn\u2019t we be the first ones to benefit?\"\n\nIn California, several cities have created cannabis equity programs to help former drug dealers go legal. The programs include business development, loan assistance and mentor relationships. In September 2018, former Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation to partially fund such programs. The bill stated it would help ensure \"that persons most harmed by cannabis criminalization and poverty be offered assistance to enter the multibillion-dollar industry as entrepreneurs or as employees with high-quality, well-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, regulators have also launched an equity program after acknowledging that while the state's population is 22 percent Latino or African-American, that same demographic makes up 75 percent of people imprisoned under mandatory minimums for drug crimes. The Bay State's equity program is specifically reserved for residents with a drug conviction or those who are married to someone with a drug conviction.\n\nYears after he was arrested, Blunt is now the first Oakland resident to benefit from the city's special license preference program. Under the equity program, longtime Oakland residents who were hurt by the war on drugs are getting priority, preference and special assistance to open up marijuana stores so they can sell cannabis legally. Blunt, who got his criminal record cleared once he finished his sentence, actually had to get it temporarily reopened so equity program managers could verify his arrest.\n\nBlunt tried to break into the industry on his own a few years back but couldn't crack into California's majority-white cannabis club scene. The equity program helped him launch his marijuana store, Blunts+Moore, in November. He sees the national push for more equity programs as a key component to easing the damage caused by the war on drugs.\n\n\"We're not just budtenders, not just security guards anymore. We're owners now,\" he said. \"To be able to sell this legally in my city, literally 10 blocks from where I caught my case, I'm fine \u2013 I wasn't going to let anything stop me. I'm the new kid on the block, and I'm here to change the game.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/02/21/marijuana-legalization-2019-black-latino-dealers-now-getting-help/2838959002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/20/supreme-court-states-cant-impose-excessive-fees-fines-forfeitures/2919411002/", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Wednesday that states cannot impose excessive fees, fines and forfeitures as criminal penalties.\n\nThe decision, which united the court's conservatives and liberals, makes clear that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against \"excessive fines\" applies to states and localities as well as the federal government.\n\nAssociate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just back in court this week after lung cancer surgery, wrote the majority opinion and announced it from the bench.\n\n\"The protection against excessive fines guards against abuses of government\u2019s punitive or criminal law-enforcement authority,\" Ginsburg wrote.

The court's ruling could cut down on their imposition in the first place.\n\nState and local governments increasingly use funds collected in criminal and civil cases to pay for municipal services. The 100 cities with the highest proportion of revenue from fines and fees in 2012 financed 7 percent to 30 percent of their budgets that way, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\"Imposing monetary penalties that bury people under mountains of accumulating debt has devastating consequences on individuals, families and entire communities, particularly low-income communities of color,\u201d said Nusrat Choudhury, deputy director of the ACLU Racial Justice Program.\n\nThe practice often leads low-income defendants further into poverty, crime, prison and recidivism, the liberal Southern Poverty Law Center and libertarian Cato Institute argued in court papers. The American Bar Association noted that nearly two-thirds of prisoners have little prospect of paying the fines and fees after their release.\n\nTimbs' conviction resulted in a year's home detention, five years' probation and about $1,200 in fees. But it was the seizure of his SUV that led to the lawsuit. The 2012 Land Rover LR2 was even a named plaintiff in the case.\n\nWesley Hottot, senior attorney with the Institute for Justice who argued Timbs' case, said the ruling \"should go a long way to curtailing what is often called \u2018policing for profit.\u2019 \"\n\n\"Police and prosecutors employ forfeiture to take someone\u2019s property, then sell it and keep the profits to fund their departments,\" Hottot said. \"This gives them a direct financial incentive to abuse this power and impose excessive fines.\u201d\n\nBrianne Gorod, chief counsel at the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, said, \"Significantly, this case has united progressives and conservatives \u2013 both advocates and the justices themselves \u2013 in a shared understanding of the original meaning of the Constitution.\"\n\nThe seizure had been defended by several national municipal groups. They argued in court papers that the vehicle was used in heroin trafficking that could have generated hefty profits and that its forfeiture properly left Timbs without the ride he needed for his craft.\n\nThe case came to the Supreme Court from Indiana's highest court, which ruled that the excessive fines clause doesn't apply to the states. Nearly all rights, such as the Second Amendment's right to bear arms for self-defense, have been extended. The right to a unanimous jury verdict under the Sixth Amendment has not.\n\nGinsburg noted that other elements of the Eighth Amendment already are applicable to the states. The amendment states that \u201cexcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d\n\n\"For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties. Excessive fines can be used, for example, to retaliate against or chill the speech of political enemies.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/20/supreme-court-states-cant-impose-excessive-fees-fines-forfeitures/2919411002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2019/02/14/georgia-unlawful-arrest-police-brutality-black-women-policing-the-usa/2854252002/", "text": "I was among many legislators who stood by protesters, but others weren't arrested.

In 2014, black women were twice as likely to be imprisoned as white women. That number rises to four times more likely for younger women.\n\nSandra Bland's case comes to mind when most people think about black females being mistreated by police.\n\nIn 2015, Bland was found dead in a Texas jail cell after she was pulled over by a police officer during a traffic stop and arrested. State trooper Brian Encinia was eventually indicted for lying to the grand jury about the stop. Yet in 2017, the charges against Encinia were dropped in exchange for the surrender of his Texas law enforcement license.\n\nNo one was ever held criminally liable for Bland\u2019s death. Her family settled a wrongful death lawsuit for $1.9 million, but no amount of money will ever bring her back.\n\nRead more commentary\n\nCOLUMN: In touting First Step at SOTU, Trump forgot about hidden obstacles to success\n\nCOLUMN: Despite State of the Union rhetoric, immigrants contribute to US and deserve protection\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe gross injustice in Bland's case (and in so many other cases like hers highlighted by the #sayhername movement) was far worse than in mine.

Upon hearing the sound of glass breaking and someone yelling, \"They just threw a young kid to the ground, and they\u2019re arresting people,\" I along with other legislators walked down into the rotunda. We saw a larger than normal police presence, as well as constituents we recognized in the crowd.\n\nI heard an officer say, \"I could make an announcement right now to disperse, and I could arrest everyone in here.\" Shortly after, he demanded that everyone clear out of the rotunda. As an elected official, I knew that I had to stand with the constituents who were peacefully protesting. I didn\u2019t leave the rotunda.\n\nWithin minutes, the police zip-tied my hands behind my back, despite my legal right to be in the Georgia Capitol. My colleague, Rep. David Dreyer, a white man who was standing near me, was not arrested.\n\nGeorgia law states that legislators \"shall be free from arrest during sessions of the General Assembly\" except for cases of treason, felony or breach of the peace. The thought of getting arrested never crossed my mind. During a peaceful protest, no one should have been arrested.\n\nInstead, I was one of 15 people taken into custody, and the only one who was slapped with two criminal charges: one for disrupting the General Assembly (that I am a part of) and another for obstruction.\n\nAddressing the needs of black women\n\nI am the first black female chair of Georgia's Democratic Party, and hearing Abrams speak of criminal justice reform in her State of the Union response was empowering.\n\nThe Sentencing Project submitted a report to the United Nations on racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system. It states that blacks are six times as likely to be incarcerated as whites.\n\nFrom the enforcement of mandatory minimums to longer sentencing, the criminal justice system is rife with racism. As recently as 2012, women and girls of color were among the fastest growing populations in U.S. prisons. Black women also experience a disproportionate rate of police brutality: Nearly a quarter of women killed by police in 2015 were black, despite the fact that black women are only 13 percent of the female population in America.\n\nBlack women work hard for our economy and democracy. As some of the most consistent Democratic voters, and in many cases breadwinners of their families, black women deserve more than a carceral state and lack of representation. Our lives do not exist in a vacuum, and addressing one issue on its own, whether criminal justice or economic security, will not bring about the unity and equality we are striving for across the state of Georgia.\n\nI know that my party has a long way to go. We must work with others to ensure an environment where all Georgians feel like they are a part of the democratic process, and like they have the right to be heard.\n\nIncarcerated women in state prisons also have rights that are being ignored. They have the right to give birth without being shackled. Georgia is one of six states that hasn't banned the practice.\n\nAs a state, we must come together to fight for the rights of all.\n\nSen.

Raumesh Akbari and House Minority Leader Karen Camper that stops the practice of shackling incarcerated pregnant women. The bill specifically prohibits the use of restraints during active labor, while in transport to a medical facility, and during active delivery and postpartum.\n\nTwenty states have adopted anti-shackling legislation\n\nPrison (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAdditionally, the bill includes regular prenatal and postpartum medical care, with appropriate nutritional supplements and nutritionally appropriate meals, and access to breast pumps for six months after birth. It would enable breastfeeding during visits and prohibit solitary confinement for those who have given birth within eight weeks.\n\nTwenty states have adopted similar anti-shackling legislation, including Southern states Florida, Louisiana and Texas. Oklahoma is the most recent Southern state to pass anti-shackling legislation in May, and, in December, Congress passed a ban on the shackling of pregnant women in federal facilities in the bipartisan First Step Act.\n\nAnti-shackling laws are critical. For years, medical associations such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have said that the shackling of pregnant women is degrading, unnecessary and poses a risk to the health of the mother and baby.\n\nShackling limits the ability to move into different positions during labor, leaving the pregnant person in a rigid (and locked) position during contractions. The restraints also cause injuries around the arms, legs and abdomen. Postpartum, restraints can hinder the mother from bonding with the baby, particularly in breastfeeding. Beyond medical concerns, shackling also violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s banning of cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nUse of restraints on pregnant women is a human rights abuse\n\nJuana Villegas became the face of immigrant treatment in Nashville with the birth of Gael. (Photo: File / Tennessean)\n\nIn 2008, a shackling case in Nashville garnered national attention. While driving home from a prenatal visit during her third trimester, Juana Villegas was pulled over by Nashville police. Because she was an undocumented immigrant without a driver\u2019s license, she was arrested and taken to the women\u2019s detention center.\n\nTwo days later, while still incarcerated, she went into labor. The sheriff\u2019s deputies responded by handcuffing her, shackling her ankles with leg irons, and putting her on a stretcher to be transported to Nashville General Hospital. Villegas underwent active labor while her right arm and left leg were shackled to the hospital bed.\n\nThe Davidson County Sheriff\u2019s Office has since adopted a \"no shackling\" policy except in cases that are deemed a safety risk. But there is no state law that requires all Tennessee correctional facilities to do so.\n\nHealthy and Free Tennessee is committed to ensuring that incarcerated pregnant women have access to the full range of healthcare options. The use of restraints not only violates standards of care, it\u2019s a human rights violation and should be prohibited statewide.\n\nWe envision a world where all Tennesseans are empowered with the resources they need to raise healthy, vibrant families.

USA TODAY\n\nA 45-year-old undocumented immigrant from Mexico died in Border Patrol custody Monday after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas, marking the third person to die in the agency's custody since December.\n\nThe immigrant illegally crossed the border and was arrested by the Roma (Texas) Police Department on Feb. 2, requested medical attention and was taken to a local hospital, according to a statement released Monday night by Customs and Border Protection. The immigrant \"was cleared\" by officials at the Mission Regional Medical Center and was handed over to Border Patrol officials at the Rio Grande City Border Patrol Station, according to the CBP statement.\n\nThe following day, after receiving a welfare check by CBP officials, the immigrant again requested medical attention and was taken to the McAllen Medical Center, where the immigrant was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and congestive heart failure, CBP said. The immigrant remained at the hospital before dying on Monday morning.\n\nThe incident follows two cases in December when children from Guatemala, ages 8 and 7, died after crossing the U.S. border into New Mexico, drawing widespread condemnation from critics of the Border Patrol.\n\nThat prompted Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to issue new guidelines requiring his agents to more quickly inform CBP leadership, Congress, and the public of the death of people in its custody. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen later followed up by ordering more robust medical screenings of children it holds in its custody.\n\nThose deaths followed intense criticism of the agency's handling of children during the administration's now-rescinded \"zero-tolerance\" that led to more than 2,800 family separations along the border.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection spokesman Andrew Meehan said the official cause of death in Monday's case remains unknown, and that the immigrant's identity is not being released. Meehan said the department is following newly created notification guidelines following deaths in its custody and has alerted Congress and the Mexican government of the immigrant's death.\n\n\"This loss of life is tragic,\" Meehan said in a statement. \"Our condolences go out to the family and loved ones. CBP remains committed to ensuring the safe and humane treatment of those within the care of our custody.\"\n\nBorder Patrol officials have said they cannot handle the influx of family units and unaccompanied minors who have flooded the southwest border in recent years, many of them requesting asylum in the U.S.\n\nIn the past four months, a monthly average of 24,975 members of family units and 5,031 unaccompanied minors have crossed the southern border, according to CBP data. The family unit average is far higher than the monthly average of 6,406 over the same period ending in 2018.\n\nA family of asylum-seekers are taken into custody by U.S. Border Patrol agents after they crossed the U.S. border wall into San Diego, as seen from Tijuana, Mexico, on Thursday, Dec. 27, 2018.

The surge also contributed to President Donald Trump's decision on Friday to declare a national emergency to expand the southern border wall, which will also lead to a flood of lawsuits.\n\nThe new Democratic-led House of Representatives has vowed to investigate housing conditions for migrants along the border. Part of the budget deal that averted a government shutdown last week included $415 million for humanitarian relief \"specifically for medical care\" and to improve Border Patrol processing facilities in the region.\n\nCBP's summary of Monday's death did not indicate whether the immigrant was requesting asylum. It noted that the immigrant was caught by police in a second attempt to illegally enter the U.S.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/02/18/third-migrant-dies-border-patrol-custody-texas/2906286002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/02/18/civil-forfeiture-sc-nichols-myrtle-beach-bound-travelers/2870350002/", "text": "Enterprising town turns SC highways into rivers of cash\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny little place with a lot of traffic going through it to the beach.\u201d A small town profited from through-traffic by seizing people's money.\n\nNICHOLS, S.C. \u2014 They came into Nichols from all over.\n\nTwo roommates made the drive from Kings Mountain, North Carolina. One man drove from Michigan; another was passing through from New York to perhaps somewhere more exciting.\n\nIt was late spring in 2014, and the two highways that bisect this tiny rural village thronged with beach traffic. Most of the motorists were from out of state, bound for nearby Myrtle Beach until they were pulled over.\n\nIn case after case, their money was confiscated because an officer said the cash was found near drugs. Yet few motorists ever were arrested.\n\nThey were caught in one of the most aggressive civil forfeiture operations in the state. Their stories were among the dozens of similar tales from this sleepy stretch of South Carolina with a police force that seized and kept nearly $50,000 from unsuspecting motorists over a two-year period \u2014 the equivalent of $135 for every person living in Nichols.\n\nThat\u2019s six times more per resident than any other police department in the state. The next highest, the Yemassee Police Department, serves a jurisdiction about three times the size of Nichols, and seized $21 per capita.\n\nWe found the story of Nichols by analyzing data gathered in a two-year examination of forfeiture cases made by every law enforcement agency in the state from 2014-2016.\n\nOf the 10 police departments that seized the most money per capita, six served jurisdictions of 4,000 people or less. With a population of 358, Nichols stood out for the profit its police department made.\n\nPolice officials from that era have said their highway effort in Nichols was meant to reduce crime. Other than that, they have declined to explain the program.\n\nThe record of active civil forfeiture there is evidence trapped in amber because Hurricane Matthew damaged and deeply changed Nichols toward the end of our study period data. This place is no longer the same as it was in 2014 and 2015 \u2014 and its policing, like everything else in Nichols, has been affected.\n\nA close up of sirens on a police car. aijohn784, Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nBut the model from which it reaped rewards could be replicated today legally by any small town in South Carolina.\n\nPut differently, any tiny place with highway traffic like Nichols could mine for gold.\n\nHELP: Support community journalism like this\n\nTown in decline\n\nFormer mayor Jimmy Little is one of the few residents who stayed behind after floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew nearly swept away the town. ANNA LEE/Staff\n\nNichols, like many of the other small towns dotting South Carolina\u2019s Pee Dee region, has been in decline for a long time. The town\u2019s population dropped from 525 in the 1990 census to 358 a generation later. Even more may flee after Hurricane Florence\u2019s floodwaters swept through the town again last autumn.\n\n\u201cWe used to have a thriving little town,\u201d said Jimmy Little, the former mayor. An auto mechanic by trade, he and his wife, Bonnie, have lived in Nichols for 50 years. She's a retired cafeteria worker.\n\nThey remember the little farming community in its heyday, when the tobacco exchanges were full and cotton and soybeans were widely planted. Once, Nichols had a drive-in theater, and its own elementary and high schools. There was a doctor\u2019s office and a dentist, too. \u201cIt was a very convenient place to live,\u201d Little said.\n\nJimmy and Bonnie were newlyweds when they bought their first home together \u2014 a house near the main town thoroughfare that they still live in today. They raised three sons, who later found good jobs at the public golf course.\n\nBut when the textile plants closed, business dried up. Retailers, seeking the more lucrative communities in Florence and Myrtle Beach, abandoned the region. Residents like the Littles hung on as Nichols spiraled downward.\n\nBy the time the town\u2019s police department began seizing money during traffic stops in 2014, Nichols\u2019 business district had dwindled to a grocery store, a pharmacy, a propane company, a beauty shop and an accounting firm. A handful of garages, the Sunny Mart and a Dollar General also remained, eking a living from traffic on U.S. 76 and State 9.\n\nFlooding damage from Hurricane Matthew ended all that, said Geraldine Ford, a retired teacher who owns Paul\u2019s Fish Market, the only restaurant left. The October 2016 storm dumped more than a foot of rain on the area, flushing the Lumber and Little Pee Dee rivers from their banks.\n\nNichols, at the center of the convergence, turned into a funnel for all that stormwater.\n\nThe level rose faster than Ford thought possible. When the flood came, \u201cthis place looked like a river \u2014 fish floating down the middle of the road,\u201d Ford said.\n\nShe talked about Hurricane Matthew in April 2018 from the counter of her restaurant. Behind her, a dry erase board listed the day\u2019s specials: smoked neck bone and rice, field peas, butter beans.\n\nMost of the town\u2019s 261 homes were destroyed or severely damaged in 2016. Its six churches and all 22 businesses, including Ford\u2019s, were flooded.\n\nFord was lucky \u2014 the fish market sits atop a hill, so the mildew wasn\u2019t as bad as it was in most places. By the time she reopened, most of her customers had gone. Their houses were ruined, and they didn\u2019t have the money to fix them.\n\nMore: Police can seize cash in the mail. An innocent man found out the hard way.\n\nMore: Exclusive: How civil forfeiture errors, delays enrich SC police, hurt people\n\nSeizing small amounts\n\nPart of Nichols\u2019 legacy might be the law enforcement example it was setting before the flood came.\n\nThe department, with three officers and a police chief, said it was keeping residents safer by discouraging drug activity through forfeiture and road stops. The overwhelming result for the town was a stream of cash that bolstered operating budgets for cops even as it consumed police time.\n\nBut what kind of citizens and drugs were targeted?\n\nDetails in court records are scant. The Nichols cases listed only names, dates and seizure amount, and many of the people police stopped didn\u2019t have criminal records that we could find.\n\nBrandon Hamer was one of them. Hamer lost nearly all his cash when a Nichols officer pulled over his friend in March 2014. The police report said Hamer was cited for simple possession of marijuana and \u201cvoluntarily forfeited $542.\u201d\n\nThe officer gave Hamer back $42 for reasons not specified in the report.\n\nThat same week, Joseph Burris lost $242 when he signed his cash over to police \u201cbecause of its connection to the purchase of marijuana.\u201d He, too, was cited for simple possession and driving left of center, according to the officer\u2019s report, though no record of the charges can be found in public records.\n\nIn all, Nichols\u2019 tiny police force made 50 seizures between 2014 and 2015, confiscating anywhere from $80 to $6,000 at a time. In all but three of those 50 cases, owners signed waivers agreeing to forfeit their money to the police department.\n\nMore: A 'historic event': Thanking TAKEN series, 71 SC legislators unveil bipartisan push to reform civil forfeiture\n\nIn doing so, they also gave up the right to fight the seizure in court to get all or even some of their cash back. So why would they consent?\n\nMaybe the answer is in the hassle for an out-of-towner. Ed Clements, the 12th Circuit solicitor, said citizens who signed consent agreements in Nichols were told they wouldn't have to \"come back and deal with it.\"\n\nAgencies in small towns across the country have paid for vehicles and equipment using the same methods. Nichols is no different, though it lacks the interstate highways often cited by authorities as the preferred method of transport for drug traffickers.\n\nClements said Nichols is unique in that it sits at the juncture of two highways on the way to a tourist destination. \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny little place with a lot of traffic going through it to the beach.\u201d\n\nThe numbers would be unusual in other towns, but here, \u201cit\u2019s not as odd as you might think,\u201d Clements said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to the beach, and they\u2019re going to party.\u201d\n\nThat fits in with Clement\u2019s description of who police were seizing money from. Most of the cases, he said, involved \u201cnormal pot smokers who \u2026 got caught at a traffic stop with drugs in their car.\u201d\n\nMore: Trail of targets shows breadth of lives changed by forfeiture\n\nMore: He fought off a robber, but police seized his $1,800\n\nCourt records from Nichols show only three people were ever arrested and convicted of a crime. Their cash was all seized by one officer: Sgt. Keith Massey.\n\nIn March 2015, Massey seized $1,749 from David Jones after finding some loose marijuana in an ashtray, along with the remnants of four blunts, a forfeiture filing said. The combined weight of the marijuana was 0.70 grams, which would easily fit inside a soda bottlecap. Court records show no charges for Jones, who was still fighting the claims in court three years later.\n\nA month later, Massey seized $1,984 from Joshua Grant, who was stopped for speeding. Massey said he smelled marijuana, which gave him probable cause to search Grant\u2019s vehicle. A small amount of drugs, 2.7 grams, was found in the car. Grant refused to sign over his money and was charged with minor possession of marijuana.\n\nMassey and the town\u2019s former police chief, Mark Lewis, didn\u2019t return messages seeking comment for this story.\n\nLewis left the department in 2018. Massey left at the end of 2015 to work for the Horry County Police Department, according to his employment records at the Criminal Justice Academy.\n\nBefore leaving his post, Massey was recognized at the annual National Interdiction Training Conference for the largest seizure of stolen credit cards made that year.\n\nThe seizure was made during a routine traffic stop, Massey said in an interview with The Morning News in Florence. As in his other cases, Massey said he smelled narcotics, which led to a vehicle search. Instead of cash, he found 173 cloned credit cards worth more than $500,000. The news article didn\u2019t name the driver or say whether any drugs were found.\n\nLewis told the newspaper he was thankful to have the resources needed to keep residents safe from drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cYes, we stop people from speeding, but we\u2019re not a speed trap,\u201d he said then. \u201cWe\u2019re a criminal enforcement unit, and our outlook is to try to reduce the amount of crime that \u2026 passes through our city.\u201d\n\nAfter the floods came and Massey left, the town\u2019s small police force turned its attention away from targeted traffic stops to rebuilding efforts.\n\n\u2014 Nathaniel Cary contributed reporting for this article.\n\n______\n\n______\n\nHave you lost property through civil forfeiture?

His most novel idea: use an advisory body, the Memphis Shelby Crime Commission, to funnel anonymous private donations from the city\u2019s elite to reward cops who remain on the force.\n\nHis wish list, dubbed the \u201cBlue Sky Strategy\u201d and outlined in emails obtained by The Marshall Project, was ambitious: $48.2 million, including $12.7 million to subsidize housing and private school tuition for police families and $8 million for take-home cars.\n\nSo far the commission has channeled $6.1 million into the city budget, most of it for police retention bonuses. FedEx, International Paper and about a dozen other private entities are now subsidizing public safety in a big American city.\n\nThe commission has refused to disclose the amount of their individual contributions. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much the different businesses gave,\u201d Strickland said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful they gave money, and if they didn\u2019t want to say, individually, how much it was, then I am fine with that.\u201d\n\nMemphis is unusual in taking money from the private sector to pay cops, but it reflects a popular trope that blames shrinking police forces for violence. Jeff Sessions, during his short tenure as attorney general, played that theme before police audiences, and it has become routine for national police leaders to complain that the politics of Black Lives Matter and viral videos of police killing civilians, along with low pay, have made it harder to recruit and retain qualified officers.\n\nData shows that the raw numbers of police have declined over the past five years, and the rate of police officers per 1,000 residents has been dropping for two decades. At the same time, the violent crime rate has also dropped.\n\nMore: SC police make millions by seizing cash and property.

Race, justice, media\n\nAfter at least 16 years of growing police agencies, the nation lost more than 23,000 officers from 2013 to 2016, according to a U.S. Justice Department survey, bringing the total down to about 700,000. Two-thirds of 397 law enforcement agencies reported in a December survey that they have seen a decrease in applicants compared to five years ago.\n\nBut according to several policing experts, cities are too focused on raw numbers, hiring consultant after consultant in a desperate quest to increase their headcount. A cottage industry of specialists caters to jurisdictions hunting for an optimal number of cops.\n\n\u201cMost police departments have issues, not with the number of officers, it\u2019s with how they are deployed and scheduled,\u201d said Alexander Weiss, a police staffing consultant whose clients have included police departments in Chicago, Albuquerque and New Orleans. \u201cIt\u2019s more important what the officers do, versus how many of them there are.\u201d\n\nResponding to public panic over urban violence during the 1990s, President Bill Clinton signed off on millions of dollars in federal funds to hire thousands of local cops across the country. In 1997, two years after the money started to trickle out of Washington, the nation had 242 police officers for every 100,000 residents. By 2016, that number had dropped to 217 as law enforcement agencies shed jobs in the aftermath of a national recession while the nation\u2019s population grew.\n\nThe national violent crime rate, over those 19 years, dropped by 37 percent. According to FBI data, in 1997 the national violent crime rate was 611.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2016 the violent crime rate was 386.3 out of 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nFears of rising crime and shrinking officer counts have emerged as common concerns in cities across the nation from Dallas to Detroit to Memphis and elsewhere. Adding more cops to a violent city seems like an obvious fix, but there is conflicting research on the question of whether more cops drive down crime rates.\n\nJames McCabe, a retired New York Police Department official who travels the country as a police staffing consultant, says there is little clear connection between staffing numbers and crime. \u201cNew York City made the conscious decision to reduce the number of cops,\u201d he noted in an interview. \u201cAnd crime continued to go down. It\u2019s not what you have, it\u2019s what you are doing with them.\u201d\n\nMemphis Mayor Jim Strickland requested more than $48 million from the business community to attract new police hires and to award bonuses to cops who remain on the force.\n\n(Photo: Brad Vest, Memphis Commercial Appeal)\n\nThe NYPD is one of a few departments that routinely recalculate how many officers they need to staff a 24-hour cycle. Called the Patrol Allocation Plan, the statistical model studies 911 calls and calculates such variables as how the time of day and type of crime affect an officer\u2019s response time.\n\nNYPD\u2019s model is similar to what McCabe, and consultants like him, preach as the gold-standard in police staffing strategies. These \u201cworkload allocation models\u201d are time-consuming and require statistical skills that most police departments lack. Instead, cities sign pricey contracts with Weiss, McCabe and their competitors to perform data-driven analyses of how officers can best use their time.\n\nBut the suggested reforms don\u2019t always stick, because they entail a lot of bureaucracy and require wholesale support from City Hall and local police unions. The recommendations typically involve assigning longer work shifts, moving officers out of jobs that don\u2019t require guns\u2014duties such as crime scene investigations and administration\u2014and hiring more civilians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping communities figure out how they can get the most out of their police department,\u201d said Jeremy M. Wilson, a Michigan State University criminal justice professor and police staffing expert.\n\nWilson discourages police departments from comparing staffing levels to cities of similar size, and instead suggests basing police deployment primarily on the numbers of 911 calls and allowing time for cops to get out of patrol cars to talk to people. \u201cIt\u2019s important for each community to understand what the community wants and can afford,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSome communities want a community-oriented style, some want a law-and-order style, or service model. That has implications for deployment, costs, number of officers.\u201d\n\nMemphis has a murder rate worse than Chicago\u2019s and a police force that has shrunk by nearly a fifth since 2011, to a head count of 2,020. The city is on its fourth round of outside police staffing consultants in eight years.\n\nThe most significant change, prompted by an outside expert, was made on previous mayor A.C. Wharton's watch. In 2013, the department redrew its precinct maps in response to a 2012 analysis from a Washington D.C think tank, the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\nMemphis police officers assembled outside the Shelby County Justice Center during a demonstration in April 2018.\n\n(Photo: Jim Weber, Memphis Commercial Appeal)\n\nPERF\u2019s analysis, obtained by The Marshall Project, pointed out that the downtown tourist district had up to seven times as many cops on patrol per square mile as the city\u2019s more violent areas. Officers in high-crime North Memphis spent half their work day chasing 911 calls, leaving less time to learn about the neighborhoods they protect. Their counterparts assigned to the tourist zones spent only a fifth of their time answering the police radio.\n\nThe Memphis Police Department carved out new precinct boundaries, but rejected other advice. For example, the consultants found that officers were spending a lot of time chasing reports about burglar alarms and vicious dogs. City officials debated and rejected the idea of freeing up cops by outsourcing low priority complaints to other city agencies, or to private security firms.\n\n\u201cThat was going to be a pretty steep hill for us to get over with the citizens, to say we aren\u2019t providing that service anymore,\u201d said former Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong. \u201cIt is hard to stop doing something that you have traditionally done.\u201d\n\nConsultants say that in police departments across the country they encounter similar resistance to change.\n\nConsultant Alexander Weiss analyzed police staffing problems in Albuquerque and New Orleans, and learned both cities had too few officers working during the busiest periods in the week. In New Orleans, Weiss found that, as in Memphis, officers were spending too much time responding to burglar alarms and to minor traffic accidents. \u201cWhen they say \u2018we are short-handed\u2019, \u2018we don\u2019t have enough people,\u2019 what they are really describing is a gap in their ability to staff according to their plan,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nPERF also faulted Memphis for repeatedly trying to hire cops who don\u2019t meet state standards. Law enforcement agencies in Tennessee need a waiver from the Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission to employ an officer who has felony convictions or a record of various misdemeanors. The Memphis Police Department led the state during the last two years in waiver requests. A Marshall Project review of state records found that six of the 48 waiver requests came from Memphis police for non-violent crimes ranging from open container violations to reckless driving. Nashville, with 500 fewer cops, had requested none.\n\nOfficers check out firearms before the start of their shift at the Mt. Moriah Station in East Memphis in January 2019.\n\n(Photo: Brad Vest, Memphis Commercial Appeal)\n\nPERF and a successor consulting firm, PFM Group, suggested that Memphis police hire more civilians to free up officers in non life-threatening assignments.\n\nBut reforms ground to a halt because of continuing fallout from both the 2008 recession and a round of 2011 pay and benefit cuts for city employees, including police officers.\n\nOfficer attrition jumped by two-thirds, according to Memphis Police Department records, and the police union put up billboards warning passersby that the city \u201cdoes NOT support PUBLIC SAFETY.\u201d The salaries were eventually fully restored, but not the benefits.\n\nArmstrong says police recruiters from as far away as Texas and Florida were coming to Memphis to lure away his demoralized cops. \u201cUntil someone takes a look at the benefit packages, this is going to be a continual problem,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nWith thinning ranks, overtime is a necessity to keep the department afloat. Taxpayers spent $27 million in 2017 on officer overtime, nearly double the amount two years earlier. Cops complain that they are pressured to work double shifts, while residents say their local patrolmen no longer stop to share a friendly hello.\n\n\u201cOfficers burn out in this city,\u201d said Michael Williams, the president of the Memphis Police Association. \u201cYou have the police who are hesitant about doing their job because of the environment which has been created.\u201d\n\nMemphis residents have had no choice but to adapt. The Downtown Memphis Commission, a local development organization, recently organized a private security force that patrols a 6-mile swath of downtown and its outskirts, on foot, bike or Segway. The Blue Suede Brigade has 34 state-licensed officers, equipped with handcuffs, batons, pepper spray\u2014but not guns. City Hall spokeswoman Ursula Madden described the brigade as \u201can added layer of support.\u201d\n\nLongtime furniture shop owner Bartley Garey in North Memphis, like most residents in the city, has no access to private security patrols. After noticing a reduced police presence a few years ago, Garey started to close his Hollywood Furniture & Hardware store by dusk. \u201cI feel if I call 911\u2014and I am being perfectly honest\u2014I would be put on hold,\u201d Garey said.\n\nMichael Williams, president of the Memphis Police Association, says officers are overworked, underpaid and are leaving the department because of their frustrations.\n\n(Photo: William DeShazer for The Marshall Project)\n\nStrickland, then a city councilman, campaigned in 2015 as the \u201ctough on crime\u201d mayoral candidate, and became the first white mayor of this majority-black city in 24 years. He vowed one of his priorities would be \u201cretaining and recruiting quality police officers.\u201d Strickland hired his own outside brain-trust, starting with former New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly, known for his aggressive use of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d and for getting New York\u2019s crime to historic lows.\n\nOn Strickland's watch, the department has added about 100 civilians. The city also agreed to reinstate a program that trains recent high-school graduates to process minor traffic accidents.\n\nKelly was vice chairman of a security firm called K2 Intelligence. Strickland side-stepped the City Council and asked the Memphis Shelby Crime Commission to pay for K2\u2019s six-figure contract.\n\nKelly\u2019s June 2017 report on \u201ccrime reduction strategies\u201d criticized Memphis police for failing to do the basics: Shooting trends were not mapped and analyzed; cops weren\u2019t being deployed to areas with upticks in violence, known as \u201chot spots;\u201d weekly crime stats were not being shared with the public on the department\u2019s website.\n\nKelly recommended that the city hire another round of consultants to figure out how many cops Memphis needs by calculating trends in officer workloads. The city of Memphis contracted with the International Association of Chiefs of Police, or IACP, to do the assessment. IACP, the nation\u2019s largest police chief organization, is also looking into how Memphis runs its police academy. Although IACP\u2019s contract says it would provide progress reports on its findings, City Hall said the updates don\u2019t exist.\n\nCapt. Eleslie Walker of the Blue Suede Brigade, a private security force, makes his way down Beale Street, a popular tourist destination in downtown Memphis.\n\n(Photo: William DeShazer for The Marshall Project)\n\nIn response to Kelly\u2019s suggestions on how to get crime down, authorities added more personnel to a gang unit that is staffed by local and federal officers, and the police department made its weekly crime meetings, said the City Hall spokeswoman, \u201cmore in-depth.\u201d\n\nViolent crime, as of the end of November, is up 2.4 percent compared to the same period in 2016. An August hiring and recruiting report from the Memphis Police Department says that 22 cops who had signed up for the privately financed bonuses left their jobs anyway. The report describes Strickland\u2019s new hiring efforts as \u201cstruggling.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Strickland is facing re-election this year. The centerpiece of his campaign? The need for more cops to carry on the fight against violent crime.\n\nAdditional reporting by Andrew R.

Where's the mandate providing legal services, job security for those released early?\n\nLast month, Matthew Charles (who was serving a 35-year sentence for charges related to crack cocaine distribution, among other things) became one of the first people released from federal prison under the First Step Act.\n\nThis month, his presence at the State of the Union address reminded the nation that some people serving lengthy sentences do indeed deserve a second chance at freedom.\n\nBut what President Donald Trump's brief retelling of Charles' story (and the First Step Act itself) misses is the fact that being free from incarceration does not help inmates achieve economic freedom. And it's the latter that determines whether someone who has spent years behind bars will avoid recidivism.\n\nSuccessful re-entry into society requires extensive post-incarceration support services, especially free legal assistance that can help former inmates address obstacles that can, among other things, hinder employment \u2014 problems that could be better addressed within the First Step Act.\n\nMatthew Charles is recognized by President Donald Trump during the State of the Union address. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY)\n\nInsurmountable debt\n\nOne of the hardest things for newly released inmates (the First Step Act will discharge more than 50,000over the next 10 years) to escape is debt. Court fines and fees (especially from unresolved state cases) and old traffic tickets can come back to life once the person has been released from federal custody.\n\nIt is quite possible for a speeding ticket from decades ago to balloon to five times the original amount.\n\nAnd in cases when it's impossible for ex-felons to get out from under large amounts of debt (putting some at risk for jail time), having the help of an attorney can be crucial. A lawyer can help with bankruptcy filings, a motion to modify the debt, or petition the court to convert the fine to a community service.\n\nRead more commentary\n\nCOLUMN: Why an ex-FBI agent decided to break through the blue wall of silence\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nNot only could an unpaid ticket become an insurmountable debt for folks fresh out of prison looking for a job, it could also create a secondary problem \u2014 revoked driving privileges.\n\nIn the past, something as simple as getting a license was a difficult game-changer for felons leaving federal custody.\n\nThe First Step Act includes a provision requiring the government to help prisoners obtain a license (or some other form of ID) as part of prerelease procedures. It's a step in the right direction, but it's too soon to know whether the provision will produce meaningful results.\n\nThere is a mountain of issues that could make the task difficult for inmates \u2014 outstanding child support (at least 20 percent of U.S. inmates owe child support) and possible prior DUI convictions are among them.\n\nSolving those problems requires knowledge of a bureaucratic system that many former inmates may not have interacted with in years. It also requires the stamina to navigate across bureaucracies, which in most states involves tracking down multiple agencies that oversee cars, insurance, child support and collections.\n\nEven harder than getting a license is navigating the family court system. Many people re-entering communities have complex legal problems related to child custody. Some might need to modify court orders after years of incarceration. Others might have started a new job, and need to adjust visitation schedules.\n\nHelp is there, but it's not enough\n\nEven though many states offer some type of free civil legal help, services are stretched thin. A government mandate could help provide the money needed to fill in the gaps.\n\nSome former inmates who are able to secure well-paying jobs may become ineligible for free services as they exist today. Many of those inmates won't make anywhere near enough to afford a private attorney. It's easy for these types of legal problems to contribute to a cycle of poverty, instability and re-incarceration.\n\nThese are complex, daunting and time-consuming problems that act as barriers to long-term employment, family cohesion and stability.\n\nAs the First Step Act's early release becomes reality for thousands of incarcerated individuals, addressing hidden obstacles to successful re-entry will become increasingly urgent.\n\nWe ought to ask what can be done to help people get and keep good jobs, and what can be done to set people up for success.\n\nAddressing one person\u2019s suspended driver\u2019s license does more than allow that person to drive. It magnifies all previous efforts spent on job training and placement.\n\nAddressing child support and custody problems does more than establish a new payment and visitation schedule. It creates a pathway to stability and family. For genuine success there need to be resources, including legal resources, that can meaningfully address hidden obstacles.\n\nEden Forsythe is the executive director of Civil Justice, Inc., a Maryland-based nonprofit organization providing legal services for low-wage workers.

(Feb. 14) AP\n\nFormer Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke, serving nearly seven years in prison for the murder of a black teen, was assaulted by fellow inmates soon after he was transferred to a prison in Connecticut this month, according to his wife and attorneys.\n\nVan Dyke, who is white, was convicted in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm in the 2014 shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The killing sparked protests in Chicago and outrage across the country.\n\nThe ex-cop was sentenced last month to an 81 months in prison. Records show he is being held at a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut.\n\nHis attorneys said he was attacked in his cell on Feb. 7, two days after he arrived at the prison.They said he suffered facial injuries in the attack.\n\nAttorney Tammy Wendt, who served on Van Dyke's trial team, said a prison employee called her Wednesday with details.

She said the agency did not give her a reason.\n\nWendt said Van Dyke was immediately placed in general population at the Federal Correctional Institution Danbury.\n\nShe said he was \"led like a lamb to the slaughter.\"\n\n\"He was placed in general population in a unit filled with gang-bangers, violent criminals,\" Wendt said.\n\n\"Even though they call this a minimum-security prison, these are violent criminals on the last leg of their sentence. To put a police officer who has spent his entire career locking up bad guys in with these bad guys, it doesn't take a genius to know that it's obviously going to get him in trouble. It's unconscionable that this happened.\"\n\nVan Dyke received medical treatment and was placed in a segregated housing unit, Wendt said. She said he informed his attorneys of the attack during a conference call this week to discuss his appeal.\n\nAfter Van Dyke was convicted, he was sent to a jail in Western Illinois to await sentencing because authorities feared they could not assure his safety in Cook County.\n\nAttorney Jennifer Blagg, who is working with him on his appeal, said he was held in at least one other facility before he was moved to Danbury.\n\n\u201cHe was in another facility where he felt safe,\" she said. \"And then he was moved (to Connecticut).\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Corrections said Van Dyke was transferred under terms of a federal intergovernmental agreement.\n\n\"For safety and security purposes, the department does not discuss details of those transferred under this agreement,\" spokeswoman Lindsey Hess said.\n\nTiffany Van Dyke, wife of Chicago PD officer Jason Van Dyke, and attorney Dan Herbert talk to media about attack on officer in a Connecticut prison pic.twitter.com/o50vxwb2CP \u2014 Aamer Madhani (@AamerISmad) February 14, 2019\n\nThe Bureau Of Prisons confirmed Van Dyke was a victim of an assault resulting in minor injuries but declined to provide further comment about the attack.\n\n\u201cThe BOP is committed to ensuring the safety and security of all inmates in our population, our staff, and the public,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cAccordingly, allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is taken if such allegations are proven true, including the possibility of referral for criminal prosecution when appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe injuries were not life-threatening but nonetheless jarring to Van Dyke and his family, who have expressed concern that prison officials won't be able to keep him safe.\n\n\"I've had a feeling in bottom of my stomach since they took him away ... that something was going to happen,\" said Tiffany Van Dyke, his wife.\n\nSupreme Court push: Illinois AG asks state supreme court to re-sentence Chicago cop who murdered Laquan McDonald\n\nVan Dyke sentenced: Chicago cop Jason Van Dyke sentenced to more than 6 years for murder of Laquan McDonald\n\nVan Dyke\u2019s defense team has been in contact with the Illinois Department of Correction to discuss his safety since the attack, Blagg said.\n\n\u201cJason runs into problems because of what he represents,\" Blagg told USA TODAY. \"There are inmates who resent that and would be proud to say they are the guy that beat him up or hurt him.\u201d\n\nThe shooting of Laquan McDonald was one in a series of deadly encounters that fueled a national conversation on policing in black communities.\n\nPolice were called to a parking lot on the Southwest Side of Chicago on the evening of Oct. 20, 2014, on reports of a person breaking into trucks and stealing radios.\n\nOfficers arrived to find McDonald walking erratically in the street with a small knife.\n\nVan Dyke pulled up to the scene, got out of his squad car and within seconds opened fire.\n\nHe shot the teen 16 times.

So they list John Doe or just a first name as the person who owns the money and may want to argue for its return.\n\nNot once in recent years were authorities able to track down a John Doe once they had mishandled a seizure and lost the attached property owner's name, our investigation found. In each instance, the state awarded the money to the police.\n\nOther times, cops kept the money locked in evidence rooms as the people who could make claim to it grew older and died.\n\nIn some cases, by the time police eventually filed paperwork and a prosecutor began to try to track down owners to serve court summonses, relatives sent a death certificate as proof to claim money a loved one never had the opportunity to receive.\n\nSometimes, people responded in time to claim money, either because authorities tracked them down at a known address or because they happened to see the case listed on the court docket.\n\nBut in most instances, no one ever responded.\n\nPerhaps the person had moved.

Or, most likely, they never knew they could get it back.\n\nHELP US: Keep important community journalism alive. Subscribe today.\n\nBundling the money\n\nWhat sets these specific cases apart are the sheer numbers. Rather than prosecuting each case separately like most other cases in the state\u2019s civil court system, some agencies are lumping dozens, even hundreds, of subjects into a single case. A mass forfeiture filing.\n\nAgencies within South Carolina used this tactic of mass forfeiture cases to seize nearly $1.1 million from more than 1,400 people in at least 14 cases from 2014-2016 that our investigation found.\n\nAlthough the deadline to seek forfeiture is two years and most cases stretched well beyond that benchmark, less than 1 percent of that money ever made it back to its owners.\n\nProsecutors call the cases \u201ccleanups\u201d and say the money was abandoned. People contacted about it later say they never abandoned their money and they didn\u2019t consent for it to be taken.\n\nGreenville police seized $427 from Christopher Lewis in 2010, and he pleaded guilty to marijuana possession but said his money was from a paycheck he\u2019d cashed and tips from pizza deliveries, not from dealing drugs.\n\nWhen he found out the police was finally seeking forfeiture of his cash, he wrote a letter saying he hadn\u2019t abandoned it. \u201cI was unaware that it was possible to have the money returned to me,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSix years later, his money was returned. \u201cI thought it was gone,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials offered various explanations about why these cases exist. Sometimes, an officer seized property, but the case was never filed. Other times, money was seized as evidence and then forgotten in an evidence room for years until the room was cleaned out. Or, a person\u2019s pockets were emptied of cash when they were booked into jail, and when they checked out, their money wasn\u2019t returned.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Johnny Mayes was part of a mass forfeiture filing made in 2017 by Pickens County against a long list of sums of cash plus 56...

Prosecutors work with law enforcement to process cases, bunching them together into lump cases with dozens or hundreds of \u201cinterested parties.\u201d Unlike traditional forfeiture cases, they provide few details of why the money was seized and no narrative for a judge to adequately determine whether the police should be awarded the money, the statewide TAKEN investigation found.\n\nState law says police must file a report with the prosecutor within 10 days or a \u201creasonable time\u201d after they seize property.\n\nThe prosecutor then has two years to file for forfeiture. In most of these bundled cases, they\u2019ve delayed well beyond that legal deadline. But they file them anyway. Although the property was in police custody the entire time, the prosecutor says it was a failure by individuals to claim the money or to file to get it back and asks that the cash be forfeited to police.\n\nMore: Enterprising town turns SC highways into rivers of cash\n\nMore: Police can seize cash in the mail. An innocent man found out the hard way.\n\nReaching way back\n\nSome of the forfeiture cases with recent activity on them date to incidents that actually occurred as far back as the 1990s.\n\nTake a single Florence County case, for instance. Filed in 2015, Florence police sought to keep money from 495 people for encounters that had occurred between 1990 and 2010 \u2014 well beyond the state\u2019s two-year window to file. Police went ahead with the case anyway.\n\nFor many of the interested parties, the department only listed single names \u2014 Moses, Pugh, Smiley, Hilton, Boston, Mack, Twiggs, Mumford. For others, they listed \u201cunknown\u201d or a location where they\u2019d seized the money: McDonalds, Coca Cola Co., 126 Toledo.\n\nHere, $30 from Graham. There, $40 from someone named Muldrow.\n\nThey\u2019d taken $1 from Sanders in 1992. Another $1 from Graham in 1998. They took $1,509 and $3,275 from two people listed as \"?????????????????.\"\n\nThe largest amount was more than $7,000 seized from a man named Robert Rushing on Nov. 10, 1999.\n\nAlthough the department couldn\u2019t determine last names for hundreds of people it had taken money from through the years, police said the money was seized lawfully.\n\nThe court filing says authorities believe \u201ceach individual defendant was informed as to the forfeitability of the seized monies,\u201d despite the fact that no proof is offered in the case file.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Solicitor\u2019s Office in Florence County couldn\u2019t track down the identity of a single person associated with the money.\n\nAll of it, $182,511, was awarded to law enforcement.\n\nMoving for forfeiture 18 years later\n\nThese delay tactics are not an accident, say numerous critics of the process and attorneys who handle forfeiture cases. The wait benefits law enforcement officers, who know that if they neglect to file for forfeiture, most people will lose interest or won\u2019t be located and will never fight to get their money returned, they say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a money-making operation,\u201d said attorney Lawrence Crane, who has extensive experience defending clients in forfeiture cases. Departments do it because it works, he said.\n\nWalt Wilkins, incumbent 13th circuit solicitor, speaks with supporters in 2018. He said his office makes every effort to track down people who may claim seized money but often can\u2019t locate them. JOSH MORGAN/Staff\n\nWalt Wilkins, the solicitor over Greenville and Pickens counties, didn\u2019t dispute that the process ends up putting extra money into the hands of the police department, which gets 75 percent of any forfeiture profits, and into his office, which gets 20 percent.

Not until 2017, anyway, when his money was wrapped into a larger case seeking possession of money from 56 people.\n\nHe contacted Crane, his attorney.\n\nTo Crane, the case was simple. The state hadn\u2019t sought Robinson's money in time. They didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.

In some instances, the marijuana weighed 0.02 or 0.03 grams, the weight of a few grains of sand.\n\nThis is not the kind of case lawmakers intended the forfeiture statute to address.\n\nSometimes, the seizure was as small as $13. It never was more than $500.\n\nThen, rather than filing cases as they came through the department, the agency held onto small amounts of cash for more than a year and sometimes nearly two years before prosecutors filed a forfeiture case.\n\nAlmost no one contested the seizures.\n\nMore: If SC seizes your vehicle, you're guilty until you prove yourself innocent\n\nMore: How we brought TAKEN to life\n\nLarge quantities of marijuana, money, firearms and other contraband sit on display during a Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office press conference on Operation Rolling Thunder's seizures on May 4, 2018.

Often, citizens who had money seized didn\u2019t know they could try to get it returned, or they didn\u2019t want to challenge the authorities, citizens and defense attorneys said.\n\nThe Richland County Sheriff\u2019s Department didn\u2019t comment despite multiple emails to the department and a phone conversation with public information officer Capt. Maria Yturria.\n\nThe small amounts of money add up.\n\nIn just those mass forfeiture cases involving amounts less than $500, the Richland County Sheriff\u2019s Department won judgments for more than $69,000 to add to its resources over several years. It would be a money-losing operation if the department filed the cases individually. But by bundling them, it paid a single $150 court filing fee for as many as 127 people in one case.\n\nSheriff\u2019s deputies spent hundreds of employee hours traipsing across the state to locate people to serve notices, according to court filings. Deputies still couldn\u2019t track down more than 65 percent of the people in that single 127-person case.\n\nUnless those people happened upon a legal notice that ran for three consecutive weeks in The Free-Times, an alternative weekly in Columbia, they\u2019d never know they could\u2019ve gotten their money back.\n\nCleaning out evidence, confronting the dead\n\nGreenville Police Chief Ken Miller said his agency has worked to reduce the amount of cash stored in its evidence room. As part of that process, the police found numerous cases where cash should have been deposited in an account instead of kept in the evidence room, he said.\n\nAs a result, he said, the department had allowed some forfeiture cases to slip by. \u201cThere are those cases that get out there, and they just sit there,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenville filed five separate mass forfeiture cases between 2014 and 2016. The amounts added up to about $79,000. Defendants claimed $6,500 of it. The rest was split between the police, the solicitor and state coffers.\n\nThe same process has been underway at numerous departments across the state, including Florence, Kershaw and Pickens counties. Cases that should have been handled years ago are surfacing, and departments lump them together into giant forfeiture filings.\n\nWhen the Pickens County Sheriff\u2019s Office cleaned out its evidence room in 2017 and prosecutors filed to forfeit money seized from 56 defendants between 1995 and 2012, 15 people responded.\n\nOne of those was Doris McMullen.\n\nShe'd come home one day in November 1996 to find officers searching her house. They told her they suspected her husband, Kelvin, was dealing marijuana, but they didn\u2019t find any drugs, she said. They did find a Crown Royal bag with $4,365 inside. McMullen said she told the deputies then that Kelvin kept money from his disability checks saved in the bag. They told her it was gambling proceeds, she said.\n\n\u201cThey just took the money and said that\u2019s where it came from,\u201d McMullen said.\n\nHer husband was taken to jail and charged with gambling. Soon after, four drug charges were tacked on. Each charge was dismissed. But the Sheriff\u2019s Office kept the money.\n\nHer husband died the next year, and McMullen forgot about the cash.\n\n\u201cThe police seize money,\u201d she said, \u201cdon\u2019t anybody ever think they\u2019re gonna get it back.\u201d\n\nTwenty years later, she got a knock at the door. A deputy served her with papers. If she called the solicitor, she may be able to get her husband's money returned. She did, and soon a check arrived in the mail.\n\nHer letter to the court carries the echoes of so many others who didn\u2019t have a chance to contest what police took.\n\n\u201cI was never given a forfeiture hearing,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t sign it away.\u201d\n\n______\n\nHave you lost property through civil forfeiture?

USA TODAY\n\nA Louisiana police department is the latest entity to get caught in a scandal involving blackface, adding to a disturbingly growing list of offenders from the late 20th century.\n\nThe Baton Rouge Police Department issued an apology after the revelation of a photo showing two of its officers wearing blackface as part of a 1993 undercover operation in which they were impersonating drug dealers in a predominantly black neighborhood.\n\nAccording to the news website The Rouge Collection, which first published the photo, media outlets in Louisiana\u2019s capital city were emailed images of a BRPD yearbook with the photo of the two officers in blackface over the caption, \u201cSoul brothers.\u2019\u2019 One of the policemen is making what appear to be gang signs.\n\nBaton Rouge police officers Don Stone and Frankie Caruso are shown in the 1993 department yearbook dressed for a sting operation. (Photo: The Rouge Collection)\n\n\u201cBlackface photographs are inappropriate and offensive. They were inappropriate then and are inappropriate today,\u2019\u2019 Police Chief Murphy Paul said in a statement. He explained the white officers in question were subject to a different code of conduct at the time.\n\n\u201cToday, we would not allow our officers to wear blackface in an official capacity under any circumstances. We have policies in place to prevent our officers from engaging in this type of behavior both on and off-duty.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe mounting instances of persons in position of authority shown to have links to the use of blackface have roiled politics in at least two states and sent some institutions scrambling to scrutinize their past for signs of such a practice.\n\nOn Jan. 24, Florida Secretary of State Michael Ertel resigned after the discovery of photos of him dressed as a woman with his face painted black at a 2005 Halloween party.\n\nIn Virginia, three of the state\u2019s top elected leaders have been embroiled in blackface-related controversy, while a fourth one \u2013 Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, the only African American in the quartet \u2013 has been accused of sexual assault by two women.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Ralph Northam has resisted continued calls for his resignation since first admitting on Feb. 1 that he was one of the two persons \u2013 one wearing blackface, the other one in a Ku Klux Klan outfit \u2013 who appeared in a photo on his 1984 medical school yearbook page. Northam later said he actually wasn\u2019t in the photo but acknowledged darkening his face to resemble Michael Jackson in a dance contest.\n\nMore: Virginia scandal: Why politicians shouldn't always be purged over past blackface incidents\n\nMore: Dapper Dan seeks accountability amid Gucci blackface scandal\n\nLast Wednesday, state Attorney General Mark Herring \u2013 who initially was among the Democrats calling for Northam to step aside \u2013 acknowledged his own episode of wearing blackface while in college in 1980.\n\nThe next day, the Virginian-Pilot newspaper reported that state Sen. Thomas Norment, one of the leading Republicans in Virginia, oversaw a 1968 college yearbook that included several racist photos and slurs.\n\nAlso last week, the University of North Carolina denounced racist photos that appeared in a fraternity yearbook in 1979. Two other universities in the state, Wake Forest and Elon, acknowledged finding similarly racially offensive photos during examinations of their yearbooks, the ones from Wake Forest taken in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cI think every school, especially schools in the South, are probably examining yearbook materials,\u201d Elon spokesman Dan Anderson told the News & Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nThe admission by Baton Rouge authorities of its officers\u2019 past tactics comes at a time of latent tensions between primarily white police departments and members of the black community in several cities.\n\nIn the last several years, young African Americans like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Philando Castile and Stephon Clark have been killed by police, often under questionable circumstances, leading to widespread protests.\n\nOpinion: NAACP president: Dehumanizing African-Americans with blackface has real consequences\n\nOpinion: Virginia scandal: Why politicians shouldn't always be purged over past blackface incidents\n\nA 2018 study conducted by the UCLA School of Medicine concluded that police violence disproportionately affects young people of color. The study also showed African Americans are 2\u00bd times more likely to die at the hands of police than whites.\n\nBaton Rouge had its own prominent instance of a black man being killed by police in the case of Alton Sterling who, in 2016, was shot to death after two white officers wrestled him to the ground. Neither officer was charged.\n\nFor decades, Baton Rouge has lacked enough black representation in its police force, one of the reasons cited for the white officers \u2013 identified as Capt. Frankie Caruso and Lt. Don Stone \u2013 dressing in blackface during the 1993 sting operation, according to a story in the local Advocate newspaper.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s second-largest city remains under a 1980 consent decree that aims to improve opportunities for African Americans and women to get hired in the police and fire departments.\n\nThe Advocate reported in July that while blacks make up 55 percent of Baton Rouge\u2019s population of 225,000, they only represent 33 percent of the police force.

(Feb. 11) AP\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and special prosecutor Joseph McMahon said Monday they are petitioning the state\u2019s supreme court to order the re-sentencing of Chicago Police officer Jason Van Dyke in the shooting death of Laquan McDonald.\n\nVan Dyke was sentenced last month to six years and nine months in prison for the murder of the black teen in 2014. But McDonald\u2019s family and civil rights activists said the sentence was too lenient.\n\nVan Dyke was convicted last year of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery.\n\n\u201cAfter conducting a thorough review of the record in this case and the law, and in consultation with the special prosecutor, I determined that a mandamus action must be pursued in the Illinois Supreme Court,\u201d Raoul said at a news conference.\n\nMcDonald's great uncle and several civil rights groups wrote to prosecutors last month to argue the sentencing violated the state\u2019s \u201cone act, one crime\u201d law.\n\nUnder the statute, they said, if a person is convicted of multiple offenses resulting from a single act, the court can impose a sentence only for the most serious offense.\n\nJudge Vincent Gaughan ruled that Van Dyke\u2019s second-degree murder conviction was more serious than aggravated battery convictions. But the state treats aggravated battery with a firearm as a more serious offense.\n\n\u201cIllinois law required Judge Gaughan to impose sentence on the aggravated battery convictions, not the second-degree murder conviction,\u201d McDonald's great uncle Marvin Hunter and the civil rights groups wrote to Raoul and McMahon.\n\nKane County State's Attorney Joseph McMahon, right, and Attorney General Kwame Raoul speak during a news conference Monday, Feb. 11, 2019, in Chicago. Raoul and McMahon, who won the conviction against Jason Van Dyke, said they believe Judge Vincent Gaughan did not properly apply the law when he sentenced Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer who fatally shot black teenager Laquan McDonald, to six years and nine months in prison. In a rare move, they filed a request with the Illinois Supreme Court seeking an order that would send the case back to Gaughan for a new sentence. (Photo: Noreen Nasir, AP)\n\nVan Dyke had expressed a measure of relief following his sentencing that he would return to his family in a matter of years, his defense team said. After Raoul's move Monday, his attorneys said they would seek to appeal the conviction.\n\nDarren O'Brien and Jennifer Blagg, defense attorneys for Van Dyke, said in a joint statement that the petition for re-sentencing was transforming \"the Illinois Supreme Court from a deliberative body into a political battleground.\"\n\n\"The filing also opens up a Pandora's box of legal issues that, in the long term, could result in grossly excessive, unjust sentences for defendants that follow in the wake of this request,\" the statement said. \"The Attorney General\u2019s and Special Prosecutor\u2019s filing today leaves Mr. Van Dyke with no choice but to appeal his conviction, prolonging this tragic case for both his family and the McDonald family.\"\n\nRaoul said politics did not motivate his decision to seek a new sentencing.\n\n\u201cThat is not a political question,\u201d Raoul said. \u201cIt is a question of law.\u201d\n\nHunter and the activists argue that state statute requires the imposition of consecutive sentences for aggravated battery convictions.\n\nAt trial, medical experts testified that no fewer than two of the shots were necessary to cause his death. As a result, Hunter and the activists argued, two of the aggravated battery counts must be imposed as consecutive sentences.\n\nProsecutors had asked Gaughan to sentence Van Dyke to 18 to 20 years. His defense team had asked that he be released on probation.\n\nVan Dyke gets prison term: Chicago cop Jason Van Dyke sentenced to more than 6 years for murder of Laquan McDonald\n\nConvicted: Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke guilty of second-degree murder in 2014 shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald\n\nGaughan sentenced Van Dyke to 81 months, or six years and nine months. State law requires that he serve at least 50 percent of the sentence. He served some three months as he awaited sentencing, so he could be out of prison in little more than three years.\n\n\u201cIt is important that a police officer was held accountable for criminal conduct,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cBut we argued at the sentencing hearing that Jason Van Dyke should be sentenced for the aggravated-battery-with-a-firearm convictions. The ability for the prosecution to challenge a sentence is very narrow, but this might be one of those situations.\u201d\n\nThere is no deadline for the Illinois high court to decide whether to consider the petition.\n\nPolice were called to a parking lot on the Southwest Side of Chicago on the evening of Oct. 20, 2014, on reports of a person breaking into trucks and stealing radios.\n\nOfficers arrived to find the 17-year-old McDonald walking erratically in the street with a small knife.\n\nVan Dyke pulled up to the scene, got out of his squad car and within seconds opened fire. He shot the teen 16 times. The shooting was captured on police dashcam video.\n\nThe City of Chicago didn't release the video until it was forced by court order. On the day of the release, 400 days after the shooting, Van Dyke was charged with murder, aggravated battery and official misconduct.\n\nThe killing of the black teen by the white police officer sparked public outrage and political tumult in the nation\u2019s third-largest city.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/11/illinois-attorney-general-jason-van-dyke-laquan-mcdonald-re-sentencing/2837396002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2019/01/31/blue-wall-of-silence-policing-the-usa-cops-community/2604929002/", "text": "Just as I testified against the officer who shot and killed 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, more cops must be willing to speak out against bad cops\n\nLike most people in law enforcement, I was once a brick in the blue wall of silence.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard about the thin blue line \u2014 the idea that police officers and the laws they\u2019re sworn to uphold are all that stand between order and chaos.\n\nThe blue wall of silence is different.\n\nIt refers to the unofficial oath of silence within departments. Cops don\u2019t rat on cops. That blue wall is one of many factors that further pushes the widening divide between the world as seen by law enforcement and the world experienced by the citizens whom officers are sworn to protect.\n\nFor my entire FBI career, I was dedicated to protecting that blue wall. But when I testified last year against Roy Oliver, the officer who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in the shooting death of black teen Jordan Edwards, I was reminded of why I decided to leave my loyalty to that wall behind.\n\nRead more opinion content\n\nCOLUMN: Trump granted me clemency, giving me a second chance.

(Photo: Rose Baca/AP)\n\nI still believe that it's important for officers to be loyal to one another; it's a dangerous profession. But our first loyalty is to the law. Bad officers make maintaining that loyalty unnecessarily tough for everyone.\n\nBreaking through that wall was hard to do\n\nEven after I retired as a special agent for the FBI and became a court-certified expert witness, I declined to take on cases in which I would be required to testify in court or give a sworn deposition against fellow law enforcement officers. My dedication to the wall ran just that deep.\n\nIt didn\u2019t start to crumble for me until about 2003, about five years after I left the bureau. I was talking over breakfast with an old friend who still worked at the FBI. He wanted to know why I had refused to work with prosecutors investigating law enforcement personnel who were being sued or charged with a crime.\n\nAt the time, the question seemed like a no-brainer. Use my expertise to testify against a police officer? That\u2019s just not what ex-law enforcement agents did.\n\nMy friend appealed directly to my sense of duty. My obligation, he pushed, was not to an individual or a group. It was to the law. And if someone hired to enforce that law violated the public\u2019s trust, it was my obligation to speak up.\n\nI winced. It felt as if he had stuck my FBI lapel pin right into my heart.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to do this work, he continued, you should be willing to look at all sides of the issue and do what you believe is right.\n\nI've carried that point of view with me ever since. Any law enforcement officer who cares about the law, and public perception, should work hard to get officers who\u2019ve done something illegal, immoral or wrong off the force. Citizens don\u2019t want them around. Just as important, neither do their fellow officers.\n\nA few months after our talk, I took my first case in which I provided expert testimony against a law enforcement official. An FBI agent, no less. It was a hard case to take. But after reviewing the documents, it was one I felt I had to. That was more than 10 years ago.\n\nThe switch was rough at first. Access to certain corners of the law enforcement world that had always been open to me was curtailed. It hurt to be seen as disloyal.\n\nEventually, though, the people who were cutting off avenues to information retired or got transferred. It took almost four years for things to return to normal. It was a small price to pay for doing something I thought was right.\n\nIt takes soul searching\n\nMy job now is about being independent and fair. I try to investigate and offer my testimony without prejudice. I have a system that\u2019s of my own making. I grade each case I receive on a scale from one to 10. I only take cases that fall on the far ends of the spectrum \u2014 bad cops doing bad things or good cops falsely accused. Even with that scale, it takes a lot of soul searching to take on a case.\n\nJordan Edwards, 15, was shot and killed by Roy Oliver, a Texas police officer. (Photo: MERRITT LAW FIRM / HANDOUT, EPA)\n\nTo civilians, this may all sound elementary. Of course you should take the stand or give a deposition against wrong-doers.\n\nIn law enforcement, however, loyalties run deep, as they should.\n\nSome expert witnesses (officers, detectives and agents) are hard-liners when it comes to the wall. Like the person I used to be, they\u2019d never consider testifying against a colleague.\n\nThis resoluteness stems from the uniqueness of the job. The lives of cops and agents are very much on the line every day. That inherent risk can create unbreakable bonds. Those factors can\u2019t be dismissed. Neither, though, can this simple fact: The bad decisions made by a few officers can undo many of the good decisions made by the rest of us.\n\nI hope there are more people out there like my friend from the FBI. We need people who are willing to have frank talks about the need to provide expert testimony not merely for \u201cboth\u201d sides, but for the right side, even if that means siding against law enforcement.\n\nThe nature of the job, and the level of violence in our country, ensures that we\u2019ll unfortunately never rid ourselves of incidents like the shooting death of Jordan in Texas.\n\nWhen incidents like these occur, I often wonder how difficult it will be for the victim\u2019s family to find a credible former law enforcement officer to testify on their behalf. I also wonder whether inadequate or nonexistent expert testimony will negate a just outcome. I wonder, too, whether a bad police officer will stay on the job and possibly do more damage, both to his colleagues and to the public, because of the failure of a defendant to build the best possible case.\n\nThe blue wall of silence, like any structure built on distrust, is one that needs to come down.\n\nPhilip Hayden is affiliated with Eagle Security Group in Fredericksburg and Arlington, Virginia.

An innocent man found out the hard way.\n\nThe next day, his friend told him he hadn\u2019t received the delivery, which required a signature to accept.\n\nRyan Hamer once sat in a Greenville parking lot, broke and hungry, and a friend offered him money to buy food and pay his cell phone bill.\n\nHe'd just moved back to town and needed a hand up. His friend came through for him.\n\nThen that same friend found himself in need. He was down on his luck, out of a job, living with his mother in Washington state and in need of money quickly to pay child support, Hamer said. Hamer agreed to loan the man $6,000.\n\nHamer didn\u2019t want to send cash through the mail, so he went to the post office and asked the best way to mail money. They told him he could buy six $1,000 money orders, so he did. It was a Friday about noon in March 2016, and the U.S. Postal Service couldn\u2019t guarantee it would arrive Saturday, so he went to the FedEx distribution center on Mauldin Road.\n\nOnce inside, Hamer dropped the money orders into a FedEx cardboard envelope, and an employee sealed it with tape. He paid a premium, $64.25, to ship the envelope overnight, his receipt shows.\n\nHamer took his receipt and left.\n\nThe next day, his friend told him he hadn\u2019t received the delivery, which required a signature to accept. Hamer called FedEx.\n\nThe FedEx employee told him he needed to contact the Greenville Police Department. Officers had seized his package in a legal process known as civil asset forfeiture.

And he has the receipts to prove it.\n\nHe showed The Greenville News receipts for his purchases of six money orders, a receipt showing he paid to ship the package overnight through FedEx and paid for it with a credit card on March 4, 2016. The receipt also listed his phone number, a number Hamer said he used twice to call Greenville police officers before they submitted court records saying the phone number was disconnected or illegible.\n\nMore: 'This is all I've got': SC grandma pays a price to save home from seizure\n\nThe News examined the FedEx slip, and the phone number was legible. It also showed an address in Greenville, also legible, where Hamer still resides.\n\nThere was no coffee bag. No foam insulation. No vacuum-sealed packages. No heavily taped box. Just the one envelope that weighed a tenth of a pound, a receipt shows.\n\nWhen a deputy delivered the summons and complaint at his attorney\u2019s office, Hamer said, \u201cLady, you\u2019ve lost your mind. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n\nStill not made whole\n\nHamer said he considered just letting the matter go because he was worried about future police harassment, but his attorney convinced him to fight it, and he was glad he did. \u201cI\u2019m sure that it was a huge embarrassment for them. And that\u2019s what I wanted,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the police department had already filed a complaint for forfeiture, Hamer had to fight the claim in civil court. He provided an answer April 6, 2016. By then, the police had held onto his money for a month.\n\nIt took another two weeks to get his money returned. The check from police came with a verbal apology but no explanation, Hamer said.\n\n\u201cWhy did they lie?\u201d Hamer said. \u201cFrom my understanding, the only reason ... is so they could take the money.\u201d\n\nWorse, even with his money returned, he wasn\u2019t made whole. He had to pay about $1,200 in attorney\u2019s fees. That still irks him, he said.\n\n13th Circuit Solicitor Walt Wilkins said he wishes those wronged by the forfeiture process could be made whole. He said he\u2019d be open to tweaking the state\u2019s forfeiture law to allow attorneys to collect fees in cases where money was mistakenly seized from an innocent person.\n\n\u201cI believe it would be fair \u2014 it would not hurt my feelings at all \u2014 that they should be made whole,\u201d Wilkins said.\n\nHamer said he\u2019s lost trust in police and still gets angry talking about what happened.\n\n\u201cWhat I did was not illegal,\u201d Hamer said.\n\nHe never did get to send the money to his friend, and he said it strained their relationship.\n\nMore: Spurred by TAKEN series, South Carolina legislators seek to reform civil forfeiture\n\nAn explanation of sorts, and an apology\n\nPresented with the case by The Greenville News, Greenville Police Chief Ken Miller pulled the reports from that incident \u2014 the search warrant for the package, the investigative report, photographs of the evidence.\n\nThose reports support Hamer\u2019s statements \u2014 it was just an envelope reinforced with packing tape, Miller said.\n\n\u201cThe form the solicitor submitted is incorrect, and there isn\u2019t any reference to that in any of the reports or affidavits,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey are all consistent with the rationale behind the search warrant, the opening of the package, the findings, the photographs are consistent with what Mr. Hamer said.\u201d\n\nWalt Wilkins, 13th Judicial Circuit solicitor for Greenville, campaigns on Augusta Road shortly before polls close on Tuesday, Nov 6, 2018. JOSH MORGAN/Staff\n\nThe News then brought the case to 13th Circuit Solicitor Walt Wilkins. When told that the police reports supported Hamer\u2019s claim that the complaint was untrue, his office scrambled to figure out what happened.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s distraught about it,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cIn our business, untruths are a big deal so nobody wants to put an untruth in a pleading or a filing.\u201d\n\nHarrison, the assistant solicitor who\u2019d handled the case, dug up the Notification of Seizure, a working document police send to prosecutors every time they make a seizure. It also matched Hamer\u2019s story, though it said the sender\u2019s name didn\u2019t come back to the address listed on the FedEx package. She\u2019d added a handwritten note saying that couldn\u2019t be true because she\u2019d found Hamer at that address.\n\nWilkins said his office likely had already shredded other paperwork from the case because it was more than two years old and had been dismissed.\n\nHis best guess as to what happened?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that there was a miscommunication between this particular case and another case, and they got conflated,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was a mistake, it was an honest mistake.\"\n\nWilkins said he has three prosecutors assigned to forfeiture who work hundreds of cases a year, filing complaints, tracking down people and making motions. This was one mistake that they tried to make right by dropping the case, he said.\n\n\u201cIf I made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nSimilar cases, different results\n\nAt least 15 times since 2016, Greenville police have seized packages filled with money or money orders \u2014 nothing illegal \u2014 from the FedEx facility on Mauldin Road.\n\nMany of those cases share similarities to Hamer\u2019s case, though none of those people have gotten their money returned.\n\nIn almost every case, police said the packages were being sent using fake names or addresses. Only once were they able to track down someone associated with a case, and that person didn\u2019t contest the seizure.\n\nParcel interdiction is hugely profitable for the Police Department. They have the highest monetary value among the forfeiture cases Greenville police have filed.\n\nTAKEN from the mail: Ryan Hamer's money goes missing He sent money to a friend in need. But it never got there. Lauren Petracca, The Greenville News\n\nSince 2016, Greenville police have seized at least $236,510 from parcels flowing through the FedEx location. Hamer\u2019s $6,000 was the only amount returned.\n\nParcel interdiction made up 65 percent of all forfeiture money the agency seized in 2016.\n\nThe Police Department began monitoring FedEx shipments in 2016, and it continues today, Miller said. Officers must have permission to monitor on site, though no formal agreement is required, he said.\n\nSometimes officers just show up to inspect packages. Other times, they\u2019ll get a call from an employee asking them to inspect a suspicious package. Sometimes packages will open by accident, and drugs will be visible inside.\n\nFedEx declined to discuss its policy for notifying law enforcement when its employees find money or money orders \u2013 not contraband \u2013 in packages shipped through the company.\n\nMore: Trail of targets shows breadth of lives changed by forfeiture\n\nMore: How local cops use federal rules to seize millions on SC roads\n\n\u201cWe routinely cooperate with law enforcement in their investigations, and we do not publicly disclose information about our security processes and procedures,\u201d said Rae Lyn Rushing, a FedEx spokeswoman.\n\nOfficers will conduct criminal investigations when drugs are found, Miller said, but not once did the department investigate a criminal case attached to those 15 money seizures from FedEx packages since 2016.\n\nMiller said that\u2019s because of the difficulty of investigating cases where items are being mailed, usually out of state. It would take coordination with other agencies and too many staff hours to investigate thoroughly, he said.\n\nGreenville\u2019s not alone in using parcel interdiction, but it has the most robust program among law enforcement agencies in the state.\n\nThe Charleston County Sheriff\u2019s Office filed 21 cases from 2014-2016. Many of those cases involved a controlled delivery where drugs in packages are delivered to the recipient, and money is seized from the person who accepts the delivery.\n\nA handful of other agencies also used parcel interdiction in the same time period, mostly during a criminal investigation when officers came across packages of drugs, unlike in the city of Greenville where officers targeted packages of money or money orders. The Horry County Police Department had four cases from 2014-2016, the Berkeley County Drug Enforcement Unit, Dorchester County Sheriff\u2019s Office and North Charleston Police Department each had two cases.\n\nSheriff\u2019s offices in Greenville and Lexington counties each had one case, as did the 15th Circuit Drug Enforcement Unit and State Law Enforcement Division. Special agents work throughout the state at various shipping facilities as part of SLED\u2019s narcotics team, said Thom Berry, SLED spokesman.\n\nAgents don\u2019t just open packages at facilities, Berry said. There\u2019s protocol to follow if a package is suspicious, he said. Packages may be damaged or display indications that narcotics may be inside. A drug dog may alert to a package. Sometimes, employees will alert agents of a suspicious package.\n\nPackages may conceal money inside innocuous items like a crossword puzzle or a comic book. But sometimes innocent victims are caught up in the search for drug money, and if their names are deemed fake by police or prosecutors or their address is listed as vacant, they may end up in the same position as Hamer.\n\n______\n\nWhen law enforcement seize money from the mail, there's often no interaction with their targets. More often though, it's the presence of cash at a traffic stop or investigation that leads to questions. And some South Carolinians are more susceptible to seizures because they carry the nation's currency.\n\nCash economy can make people prime targets\n\nSouth Carolinians avoid banks more than the average American, giving them more reasons to carry cash and inadvertently creating more opportunities for police to seize that cash.\n\nSome of those who can least afford to lose their cash \u2014 low-income, black people living in rural areas or many workers in the hospitality industry \u2014 are most likely to not use banks and are therefore most likely to carry cash.\n\nMany restaurant workers earn a portion of their pay in cash. They also keep late hours, leaving work late at night, which could also increase the risk of getting pulled over. Getty Images\n\nPolice don't often seize credit cards or debit cards or checks; just cash \u2014 up to a million dollars a year in South Carolina from people who are never arrested, according to three years\u2019 worth of forfeiture data analyzed by The Greenville News TAKEN project team.\n\nIf those citizens had carried plastic instead of cash, they\u2019d have kept their money.\n\n\u201cPeople who rely on cash are being squeezed out, and they\u2019re probably on the lower end,\u201d said Rob Baumann, chair of the economics and accounting department at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts.\n\nMore than 55 percent of black people in South Carolina either don\u2019t have a bank account or rarely use it, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s 2015 National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households. That\u2019s compared to 22 percent of white people.\n\nThose who could most benefit from a bank account to avoid check-cashing or bill-paying fees \u2014 people earning $15,000-$30,000 per year \u2014 are most likely not to own or use an account, according to the FDIC report.\n\nAndrew Ittleman, a partner at the Miami financial law firm Fuerst Ittleman David & Joseph, said a lot of low-income people avoid banks for many reasons: they could have poor credit; they could be migrants or immigrants or anyone else who prefers the privacy of cash; they could have a cultural distrust of banks.\n\nIttleman said he's also worked with Holocaust survivors who avoid banks.\n\nDistrust of banks is also common in some black communities because of a variety of historical factors, including redlining, the discriminatory practice in which banks helped keep desirable areas white through unfair loan practices, said Vernon Burton, a Clemson University history professor who specializes in race relations and the South.\n\nDecades of experience with banking have left many people preferring to hold their own money, he said.\n\nBanking system problems\n\nRace is a factor in the cash economy, but so too are wages and location and culture \u2014 the preference for cash passed down through generations.\n\nThe largest factor? Where you live. Those who live in rural areas are most likely not to have a bank account at all. Sixteen percent of those who live away from a metro area don\u2019t have a bank account, according to the FDIC.\n\nIn the coastal parts of South Carolina where some of the state\u2019s most aggressive civil forfeiture operations are located, restaurants are big business.\n\nAbout 17 percent of workers in the Myrtle Beach metropolitan area are in the restaurant industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 the highest concentration in the continental U.S.\n\nMany restaurant workers keep late hours, leaving work late at night, which could also increase the risk of getting pulled over and searched. That increases their exposure even if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong, said the Rev. Romando James, a Clemson University emeritus professor of family and youth development.\n\nDavid Smith, a Virginia attorney who helped to author the nation\u2019s civil forfeiture rules in the 1980s, said the only surefire way for people to avoid civil forfeiture of money is to avoid carrying our national currency at all.\n\n______\n\nHave you lost property through civil forfeiture?

Montgomery Advertiser\n\nMONTGOMERY \u2014 An Alabama police officer who shot and killed a man misidentified as a shooting suspect in a Hoover mall last year will not be criminally charged.\n\nAlabama Attorney General Steve Marshall on Tuesday released a 24-page report concluding the investigation of the Thanksgiving night Riverchase Galleria shooting in which a Hoover police officer fatally shot Emantic \"E.J.\" Bradford Jr.\n\nMarshall's report finds that the unnamed officer \"reasonably\" exercised his official duties in a five-second encounter in which he shot and killed Bradford when responding to gunfire at about 9:51 p.m. on Nov. 22.\n\nNov. 23: Man dead, 2 injured after Alabama mall shooting\n\nNov. 24: Alabama mall shooting: Officer killed the wrong man, officials say\n\nTwo officers responded to an initial shooting that injured 18-year-old Brian Wilson and a 12-year-old bystander. The attorney general's report concludes the first officer fired his gun four times. Three bullets struck Bradford in the neck and lower back. The remaining bullet, \"or at least a large fragment\" of it, hit a pillar near Bradford. Investigators say the fourth bullet did not strike the 12-year-old.\n\nBirmingham mall shooting (Photo: Associated Press)\n\nHoover police initially misidentified 21-year-old Bradford as the gunman, but later said he was likely not the shooter. Erron Martez Dequan Brown, 20, was arrested in Atlanta on Nov. 29 and charged with attempted murder in Wilson's shooting.\n\nBut investigators said Bradford did have a gun, though he never fired it, according to the report. Marshall's report finds that the officer's mistake in identifying Bradford as the shooter does not mean he acted unreasonably or criminally.\n\n\"First, a reasonable person could have assumed that the only person with a gun who was running toward the victim of a shooting that occurred just three seconds earlier fired the shots,\" the report states. \"... Second, as previously explained, Officer 1\u2019s primary duty and training was to eliminate any threat to innocent civilians and first responders. While it is now known that E.J. Bradford did not shoot Brian Wilson, Bradford still posed an immediate deadly threat to persons in the area. Video evidence suggests that Bradford, who was carrying a firearm, was running toward the initial shooter, Erron Brown, who was also carrying a firearm. Multiple shoppers were nearby, including a mother and child directly in between the two armed men.\"\n\nAlabama mall shooting: If Emantic 'E.J.'

Two eyewitnesses told investigators they did hear verbal commands, the report states.\n\n\"He saw a black man with a gun and he made his determination he must be a criminal,\" Ben Crump, a lawyer for Bradford's family said in November. Bradford's death and the police response sparked significant protests in the Birmingham suburb, where multiple protesters have been arrested.\n\nThe parents of Emantic \"EJ\" Bradford Jr. held a news conference in Birmingham last to appeal for more information, the Associated Press reports.\n\n\"All I'm asking for is the truth. I want the truth. I want to know what happened. Release the video so everyone can see. ...

They shape our reality and African-Americans have been paying the price for 400 years.\n\nWords and images have meaning. They have weight. And they have consequences.\n\nIn America, the most powerful and dangerous of these words and images were born in times of intense oppression and hatred. These racialized depictions and icons of speech litter our current political landscape in the form of seemingly innocuous rhetoric such as \"build a wall\" to yearbook photographs of figures in blackface.\n\nThough Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, and now Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, are at the center of this latest controversy, the true problem does not begin or end with these two men. It did not begin or end with Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile or the litany of other Black lives. It did not begin or end with the tacit endorsements of white supremacist violence from our nation\u2019s highest office. None of these events caused the racially charged violence plaguing our country.\n\nInstead, they are the consequence of our nation\u2019s collective unwillingness to recognize that 400 years of dehumanizing language and imagery have a cultural impact that expresses itself through explicit and implicit bias.\n\nOne can reach back to imperialism, slavery, segregation or the Jim Crow era, but it is not necessary. Flashpoints exist as recent as President Ronald Reagan and his words in Neshoba County, Mississippi. His callback to \"states' rights\" \u2014 an assertion historically associated with the perpetuation of slavery \u2014 made in a former Confederate state with a close and continuing relationship with terrorism and lynching, was an ill-thought, inconsiderate choice of words at best and a calculated, intentional threat at worst.\n\nMore commentary: Virginia's blackface meltdown shows how slavery and tribalism still warp our politics\n\nWhy blackface is not OK\n\nMore from News: Ralph Northam was far from alone: Why blackface keeps coming up\n\nThis racialized imagery resurfaced in the late 1980s during George H.W. Bush's campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in an ad featuring an intentionally menacing portrait of Willie Horton. The image was to tap into the cultural fears that previous depictions had established within the public\u2019s mind: that Black people are inhumane criminals.\n\nVirginia Gov. Ralph Northam and his wife, Pam, on Saturday. (Photo: Steve Helber/AP)\n\nPresident Bill Clinton fueled the fires of bias in the cultural collective with his 1994 crime bill. Ostensibly presented to keep communities safe from the \u201csuperpredator,\u201d the bill, with its incentives for harsher punishments and its three-strikes mandatory sentencing, once again correlated criminal behavior with African-Americans. Clinton's words and actions built on previous \"war on drugs\" legislation, the already growing trend of mass incarceration and the criminalization of being born with black or brown skin.\n\n'Tough on crime' targeted Blacks\n\nThe cold numbers bare this truth out. The 1980s' \"Tough on Crime\" era resulted in dramatic growth in incarceration. Of those incarcerated, African-Americans are sentenced to correctional facilities at more than five times the rate of whites. The \"war on drugs\" only enhanced the effect as, from years 1980 through 2007, African-Americans were arrested on drug charges at rates that were 2.8 to 5.5 times higher than whites.\n\nAs a result of the deliberate act to criminal people of color, by 2016, African-Americans represented only 12 percent of the U.S. adult population but accounted for 33 percent of the prison population, while whites accounted for 64 percent of the population but only 30 percent of its prisoners.\n\nThis criminalization phenomenon is not a partisan issue. The fact that Reagan's and Clinton\u2019s words and Bush\u2019s imagery encountered little resistance, and even less self-reflection, enabled others to act upon their racial bias with approval of the nation. It is today\u2019s climate of acceptance for racialized words and images that empowered George Zimmerman to gun down Trayvon Martin with both impunity grounded in the repeated correlation of Blacks and criminality. The cultural consequences of racialized language and imagery have manifested as a zeitgeist that is devastating the African-American community and fueling the need for movements and organizations such as Black Lives Matter, Dream Defenders, BYP100 and United We Dream.\n\nObama election a bright light\n\nThat is not to say that there have not been some bright lights in this darkness. The election of the nation\u2019s first African-American president, Barack Obama, was a significant step toward a truly inclusive democracy. Similarly, the FIRST STEP Act, too, will hopefully live up to its name and pave the way for more criminal justice reform.\n\nThis forward movement toward the promise America has always held is a welcomed and imminently laudable accomplishment, but it does not banish the shadows of racism and intolerance that lurk in this country\u2019s corners. Indeed, their light makes these shadows darker by contrast.\n\nThe darkness implicit in uncontested racialized speech and images carries consequences that reach all people of color. Trump\u2019s many statements and tweets calling a caravan of immigrants \u201cstone cold criminals,\u201d his policies separating immigrant families and placing children in detention centers, and his repeated calls to \"build a wall\" are all a continuation of America\u2019s embrace of racialized words and images. It is a doubling down on the dehumanization of people of color in the media.\n\nWords and images do not exist in a vacuum. They have power, and they can and have been used to threaten the livelihoods of communities of color.\n\nDerrick Johnson is president and CEO of the NAACP.

(Photo: Reinhold Matay/AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Serious misconduct by senior federal prison officials is \u201clargely tolerated or ignored altogether\u201d under a culture in which some were shielded from discipline or even commended for their service by colleagues, according to a new congressional review.\n\n\u201cFor high-ranking officers, bad behavior is ignored or covered up on a regular basis, and certain officials who should be investigated can avoid discipline,\u201d House investigators concluded in a nine-page report for the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nThe review is the latest rebuke of the Federal Bureau of Prisons where severe staffing shortages, persistent sexual harassment claims and inmate violence have shadowed operations for years.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment, citing the government shutdown.\n\nIn November, the Justice Department's inspector general cited numerous operational \"challenges\" confronting the sprawling agency as it detailed additional problems in managing its 12,567 female inmates.\n\n\"For the seventh consecutive year, the need to more effectively manage the federal prison system was included as a top challenge for the department,\" Inspector General Michael Horowitz told the same House panel. \"Staffing and overcrowding present constant challenges for BOP in carrying out its mission to confine offenders in safe, humane and cost-efficient environments.\"\n\nThe congressional review went even further, offering a blistering account of a disciplinary process that often allowed wardens and other senior leaders to operate outside the agency's rules.\n\n\"The committee reviewed cases where some individuals deemed responsible for misconduct were shuffled around, commended, awarded, promoted or even allowed to retire with a clean record and full benefits before any disciplinary action could apply,\" the report concluded. \"Documents and testimony also showed disciplinary action was delayed in some cases to allow senior leaders to retire unscathed.\"\n\nCongressional investigators found that 12 misconduct cases against five wardens were opened and closed in one day. The allegations ranged from an assault on an inmate and falsifying records to embezzlement and harassment. In every case, according to the congressional review, the complaining parties were never notified of the cases' resolutions.\n\nThe review cited two specific cases involving two wardens, one accused of \"persistent\" sexual harassment of a female subordinate and the other accused of protecting a top lieutenant from separate harassment allegations.\n\nNeither of the wardens was identified by name.\n\nIn one case, a prison psychologist reported that she was so \"creeped out\" by the repeated advances by a warden identified as \"Employee A\" that she appealed to a captain in 2017 to intervene.\n\nThe captain, according to investigators, reported the harassment to a regional director who ordered the captain to fly to her office where the director \"berated him and defended the warden over the course of a two-hour meeting.\"\n\n\"Do not bull__ me!,\" the director reportedly told the captain. \"I know everything, I see everything. (I am) aware that (the warden) has allegations of sexual harassment at all of the institutions that he has been to, and he is still sitting in the warden's chair! People need to realize that and get over it!\"\n\nMore: Exclusive: Empty guard towers allowed carjacker to escape maximum security prison\n\nMore: Federal prison executives receive bonuses despite recent issues\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/03/misconduct-prison-leaders-covered-up-regularly-report-finds/2472410002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/21/donald-trump-signs-rare-bipartisan-achievement-criminal-justice/2388653002/", "text": "President Donald Trump makes a statement on the possible government shutdown before signing criminal just reform legislation in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Dec. 21, 2018, in Washington.

Facing a midnight deadline to approve a spending bill or risk a partial shutdown of federal agencies, Trump signaled he was prepared to dig in.\n\n\"It's totally up to the Democrats as to whether or not\" there is a shutdown, he said.\n\nThe measure, known as the \"First Step Act,\" would give judges more discretion in sentencing offenders for nonviolent crimes, particularly drug offenses, and strengthen rehabilitation programs for former prisoners. It would also call for placing federal prisoners closer to home \u2013 no more than 500 miles \u2013 so families could visit more often.\n\nCriminal justice became a central issue for Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, who lobbied lawmakers on Capitol Hill to secure its passage.

Trump has supported thebipartisan measure and has said he would sign it into law. He congratulated the House for passing the bill.\n\n\"This is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody,'' Trump tweeted. \"When both parties work together we can keep our Country safer. A wonderful thing for the U.S.A.!!\"\n\nThe measure would give judges more discretion in sentencing offenders for nonviolent crimes, particularly drug offenses, and strengthen rehabilitation programs for former prisoners. It would also call for placing federal prisoners closer to home \u2013 no more than 500 miles \u2013 so families could visit more often.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving a first step to many who have not had that in the past,\" said Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., a leading sponsor of the effort. \u201cThe first step will get us to many others.\u201d\n\nCollins said was passage was due in part to timing and the right idea.\n\n\u201cI think we hit the right time with the right idea at the right moment,\" he said.\n\nRep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., joined others at a press conference Dec. 20, 2018, to praise House passage of the First Step Act. (Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY)\n\nIn a rare show of bipartisanship, Republicans and Democrats in the House praised each other across the aisle for their work on the criminal justice reform bill.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who also led the effort, applauded members from both sides as well as conservatives and liberals and the White House for uniting to address what he called \"over incarceration.\"\n\n\u201cWe incarcerate more people in the United States of America than any other county in the word,\" said Jeffries, noting there are 2.2 million people incarcerated in the United States. \u201cIt is a scandal. It is a stain on our democratic society. It\u2019s not a Democratic problem or a Republican problem, it\u2019s an American problem.\"\n\nThe legislation is the result of a yearslong process that brought together a broad coalition that included civil rights advocates, small-government conservatives and the White House. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was critical to the bill's passage and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised him.\n\n\u201cThis bill was declared dead at least a dozen times \u2026This has been a battle,\" said Holly Harris, executive director of the Justice Action Network. \"I\u2019m very hopeful that this is just the beginning of a renaissance period for criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already started talking about the second step,\" she said.\n\nSupporters say the changes will reduce strains on the nation's overcrowded prisons while reducing recidivism by expanding programs that support former inmates when they return home.

(Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY)\n\nThe House had passed a criminal justice bill this year, proposed by Collins and Jeffries, but advocates complained it didn't address the controversial issue of mandatory minimum sentencing.\n\nA Senate version sponsored by Sens. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, and Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, included prison and sentencing reforms.\n\nAmong the provisions, the measure also would allow inmates to request reviews of their cases retroactively under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. That disparity has particularly hurt African-American men.\n\nThe House voted Thursday on the revised measure.\n\nThe Senate bill had stalled in the Senate when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated he was reluctant to bring it to a floor vote by the end of the year.\n\nMcConnell reversed himself this month and scheduled a vote after pressure began to build on him from Trump and other Republican senators.\n\nSome advocates and lawmakers have raised concerns that the measure doesn\u2019t go far enough to address some issues, including bail reform, but said it's a start.\n\nRep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., the outgoing chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said the measure isn\u2019t perfect, but \u201cit\u2019s a good first step.\"\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that this bill is a positive step in the right direction,'' he said.\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who is in line to chair the Judiciary subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations when Democrats take control of the House in January, said there will be a push for more reforms, possibly including ones on bail, juvenile justice, alternative sentencing and the treatment of pregnant women in prisons.\n\n\u201cThere are elements that we can always build on,\" said Jackson Lee, adding that she plans to meet with advocates. \u201cThis is a journey that we\u2019ve just started \u2013 by getting a bill that is passed \u2026 We want to keep going on criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\nContributing: David Jackson\n\nMore: Criminal justice overhaul: An inside look at how Donald Trump and Congress got to 'yes'\n\nMore: Here's what's in the criminal justice reform bill now headed to a vote in the Senate\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/20/criminal-justice-reform-bill-passes-congress-goes-president-trump/2373992002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2018/12/19/first-step-act-prison-reform-incarceration-policing-usa/2340412002/", "text": "Commendable changes would still leave thousands incarcerated who shouldn't be\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, during a meeting on Capitol Hill. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nYears of collaboration and compromise have finally produced some good news on Capitol Hill.\n\nLast night, the Senate passed the broadest criminal justice reform bill in a generation \u2014 even in the face of attempted sabotage from Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and John Kennedy, R-La., who tried but failed to push through amendments that would have killed the bipartisan effort.\n\nBut the FIRST STEP Act is just that: a first step that will, among other things, give judges more leeway at sentencing and adjust mandatory minimums for some crack cocaine charges.\n\nThis effort, while worth celebrating, will be incomplete without more aggressive (and progressive) reforms.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nSAINTS LINEBACKER: Get justice for children in the criminal justice system\n\nCOLUMN: Criminal justice reform doesn't end system's racial bias\n\nCOLUMN: America's civil justice system needs reform, too\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nGoing beyond FIRST STEP\n\nWhile strong on its own, more broadly, FIRST STEP misses the mark when it comes to significantly reducing the incarcerated population in the U.S. Around 40 percent of prisoners are incarcerated today without a valid public safety reason. A prior incarnation of criminal justice reform, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, would have put a much more significant dent in the federal prison population by limiting the reach of other mandatory minimum provisions.\n\nAnd the federal prison system only holds about 12 percent of America's prisoners. We can\u2019t truly end mass incarceration without addressing the remaining nearly 90 percent.\n\nAltogether, that means we need to start thinking about what the nation's second step should look like.\n\nOne option is a bill that would use federal dollars to encourage states to reduce their prison rates. Congressional grant programs helped build mass incarceration. Legislation like the Reverse Mass Incarceration Act of 2017, introduced by Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., could help unwind it. The bill would have provided billions in grant funding.\n\nA second option would be to eliminate prison as a sanction for lower-level crimes, and slash sentences across the board. To end mass incarceration, every state would have to adopt its own reforms. But the federal government can show the way, by either providing incentive funding, or leading by example and making even more drastic cuts to incarceration than the FIRST STEP Act provides.\n\nNow that this moderate sentencing reform effort has been branded \u201cthe Trump criminal justice bill,\u201d politicians committed to justice reform will need to bring on much bolder and broader proposals. With an election year rapidly approaching, Democratic candidates can and arguably must compete to improve on the FIRST STEP Act. Anything less, risks ceding a bipartisan issue that advances key progressive priorities \u2014 like racial and economic justice \u2014 to Republicans.\n\nAnd conservatives looking to make a name for themselves, and court centrist voters, should be looking for every opportunity for even more bipartisan victories.\n\nThat said, we can\u2019t afford to miss any opportunity to make progress, no matter how incremental. Lives are literally on the line.\n\nA good compromise leaves everyone angry, and the FIRST STEP Act is no exception.\n\nMassive support for change\n\nThe bill started as a meek prison reform bill earlier this year. It focused on improving conditions in prison, rather than rethinking who goes there in the first place. Since the first draft lacked any changes to outdated federal drug sentences, it was a nonstarter, especially considering that broader sentencing reduction is one of the only areas where lawmakers and advocates across the political spectrum have common ground. Not surprisingly, progressive Democrats along with Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a leading voice for comprehensive support and chairman of the judiciary committee, also withheld support.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, Grassley and advocates formulated a bill that both improves conditions in prison and reduces the time people spend in them. Law enforcement groups like the Fraternal Order of Police, Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, and the National District Attorneys Association also support it.\n\nBut securing that support came at a price.\n\nKey to the FIRST STEP Act are a series of long-overdue reductions of draconian mandatory minimums for federal drug sentences. But some of the sentencing reduction provisions of FIRST STEP are forward-looking only \u2014 even though they were initially intended to help people already in prison, too. Once the bill is passed, thousands of people will continue serving time under the very outdated laws the Senate just revised.\n\nTo be sure, Congress is going to have other priorities in the next session. But with a divided government, criminal justice reform is one of the only areas of bipartisan agreement on Capitol Hill.\n\nLeaders in the House and Senate, looking to burnish their transpartisan bona fides, should take up the mantle of criminal justice reform to extend the promises of FIRST STEP. It\u2019s the right thing to do, and the public wants it done.\n\nMass incarceration took decades to build. It won\u2019t be unwound any faster. While the FIRST STEP Act marks real progress toward that goal, its lasting legacy should be to encourage the second and third steps necessary for finally securing our national promise of \u201cjustice for all.\u201d\n\nInimai Chettiar is the director of the Justice Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, and Ames Grawert is senior counsel in the program.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2018/12/19/first-step-act-prison-reform-incarceration-policing-usa/2340412002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/17/how-congress-got-yes-criminal-justice-reform-bill/2288578002/", "text": "CLOSE NAACP president Derrick Johnson on the criminal justice reform efforts occurring in Senate and whether there is hope for the Grassley-Durbin bill that is being refined.

I said, \u2018Listen, majority leaders, if they\u2019re the same party as the president, ought to be carrying out the president\u2019s agenda,' \" Grassley recalled to USA TODAY.\n\nDespite broad bipartisan support, including an unusual coalition of civil rights groups, conservatives and President Donald Trump, the Senate majority leader had not budged on the call to bring the \"First Step Act'' to the floor for a vote.\n\n\u201cHe said, 'Well, do you think I oughta tweet?\u2019 \u201d the senator remembered about the call.\n\nAt 3:56 p.m., Trump fired off a tweet.\n\n\u201cHopefully Mitch McConnell will ask for a VOTE on Criminal Justice Reform. It is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support,'' he wrote. \"It will also help a lot of people, save taxpayer dollars, and keep our communities safe. Go for it Mitch!\u201d\n\nFour days later, to the surprise and relief of supporters, McConnell went to the Senate floor and announced he would put the bill to a vote.\n\nIn a move that brought praise from both sides of the aisle, the Senate overwhelmingly voted 87 to 12 late Tuesday to approve the bipartisan bill. McConnell was among the 87.\n\nThe bill headed to the House, where it is likely to pass. Trump said he will sign it into law.\n\nThe measure,the first major criminal justice overhaul in decades, aims to reduce the number of inmates in the nation\u2019s crowded prisons. It would, among other things, give judges more discretion in sentencing offenders for nonviolent crimes, particularly drug offenses, and strengthen rehabilitation programs for former prisoners.\n\n\"The net result of it last night is nothing short of a historic vote that really changes our outlook on our system of justice for the first time in decades,'' Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said the day after the vote. \"And it\u2019s a dramatic change.\"\n\nThe path to finally becoming law hasn't been easy. It has been a yearslong fight of compromising, stalling and maneuvering in public \u2013 and behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wondering why this thing ever came up, we\u2019ve done everything everybody asked us to,\u201d Grassley said. \"It\u2019s kind of how do you eat 10,000 marshmallows? One at a time. How do you get a co-sponsor or how do you get another person to say yes to the whip call? You do it one at a time.\"\n\nHaunting stories\n\nFor many lawmakers and advocates, work on criminal justice changes goes back years or even decades.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, was a federal prosecutor in 2004 when he heard about Weldon Angelos.\n\nAngelos, an aspiring rapper, was arrested for selling $350 worth of marijuana three times while in possession of a firearm. He was sentenced to 55 years. The judge wrote a blistering opinion disagreeing with the harsh sentence, but he said he was bound by the guidelines.\n\nThe judge \"said something that would haunt me ever since then. He said, 'Only Congress can fix this problem,' \" recalled Lee, who was elected to the Senate in 2010. \"Many years later, after I got to the United States Senate, that\u2019s one of the things that caused me to start looking for allies on criminal justice reform.\"\n\nOne of those unlikely allies was Durbin.\n\nDurbin\u2019s drive to change the system stems in part from what he calls the \u201cworst votes I ever cast.\u201d\n\nIn the House, he backed a measure in 1986 that led to tougher sentences for crack dealers than for those trafficking cocaine. The measure was condemned for the disproportionate impact on African-Americans, who were more likely to possess crack than the more expensive cocaine.\n\nDurbin vowed to fix the law. When he got to the Senate, he teamed with Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., to craft a bill that reduced the disparity. It didn't go far enough for Durbin.\n\nSix years ago, he started working with Lee on the \"Smarter Sentencing Act.''\n\n\u201cI can't remember what brought us together, but it was a terrific alliance because it really puzzled people why Durbin and Lee would be doing something together,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cOur biggest problem was Chuck Grassley. He hated the bill.\u201d\n\nGrassley, who was in line to chair the Judiciary Committee, not only voted against their bill but slammed it.\n\n\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018We're going nowhere unless we have Chuck Grassley,'\" said Durbin, who would reach out to him.\n\nGrassley said he eventually came around and became a supporter, but the bill never made it past the committee.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., joined the effort.\n\nWhen Booker got to the Senate in 2013, one of his first conversations was with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., about their mutual support for criminal justice changes.\n\n\"One of the driving purposes of my life was to make a difference in criminal justice reform,\" Booker said the day after the Senate passed the bill.\n\nFor Booker, a former mayor of Newark, that passion came, in part, from watching men and women return from prison, then struggle to find jobs or housing or aid to go to college.\n\n\"Not only was the criminal justice system focused on certain communities not others ... but it was a huge blow to the economy in our city,'' he said.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., speaks to USA TODAY in his office Dec. 12 about the bill to change the criminal justice system. (Photo: Deborah Berry, USA TODAY)\n\n'Jared Kushner came to town'\n\nDespite their passion and bipartisanship, including the backing of then-President Barack Obama, the efforts stalled.\n\nThen, Durbin said, several things happened.\n\n\u201cThe most important was Jared Kushner came to town,\u201d he said. \"I met him about two years ago, and within minutes after our meeting, he said, 'You know my father was in prison' and talked about what an impact that had on him.\u201d\n\nKushner's father, Charles, went to prison in 2005 for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. He spent more than a year there.\n\nKushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, became a key player, working with lawmakers in both chambers. He was critical to getting Trump to back the efforts.\n\nOver in the House, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the incoming House Democratic Caucus chair, bonded and decided to work on a criminal justice bill that had gone nowhere. Collins is likely to be the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee next year.\n\nThey teamed with Kushner on a narrow bill that didn't address mandatory minimum sentencing. It easily passed in the spring.\n\nJared Kushner, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, was a critical voice in the negotiations for criminal justice reform. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n'Faces behind the lines'\n\nProponents of a criminal justice overhaul in the Senate were furious. They wanted to change mandatory minimums.\n\n\"We basically said we're going to do everything we can to defeat this bill in the Senate,'' Booker said. \"That basically signed the death warrant.\"\n\nThat move forced everybody, including Kushner, to the table to craft a more comprehensive bill. Collins and Jeffries were also involved.\n\n\u201cWhen you work all three legs of the legislative triad \u2026 you can get some good stuff,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThis is truly one of those bills that has faces behind the lines.\"\n\nWhile lawmakers negotiated, advocates pressed their case.\n\nEarly one morning in July, Quovadis Marshall, pastor of Hope City Church in Waterloo, Iowa, walked into Grassley\u2019s office in Washington.\n\nMarshall, who had served seven years and four months for armed robbery, brought along his wife, Angela, his daughter, Kaylee, 23, and his son, Jonathan, 11.\n\nAfter small talk about corn and soybeans, they got down to business\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got this idea of the person on the other end of crime and incarceration, but those people have families,'' said Marshall, who works with agencies to host a sports camp for troubled teens and a gang prevention program. \"Those men and women can be released to become productive citizens. We didn\u2019t want to send him a letter without a face, but we wanted him to know that every name has a story and every story has a future.\u201d\n\nMarshall said Grassley vowed to get enough support for prison and sentencing changes.\n\n\u201cTrue to form, he was right,\" Marshall said. \u201cIt seems like the old senator from Iowa knew a thing or two about his colleagues.\u201d\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, met July 9 with Quovadis Marshall and his wife, Angela, daughter, Kaylee, and son, Jonathan. (Photo: Courtesy of Heather Rice-Minus)\n\n'Sweated blood and tears'\n\nIn the weeks leading up to this week's vote, Grassley, Durbin, Lee, Booker and other lawmakers, including Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., were \"massaging'' language in the bill to sway reluctant colleagues.\n\nTexts and phones calls flew between senators and Kushner. Vice President Mike Pence and Kushner showed up at a Senate GOP policy lunch to tout the bill.\n\nDurbin and Grassley tag-teamed on stage at a Washington Post Live Center event to tout the bill and call out McConnell for not bringing their measure up for a vote.\n\n\"It's been nonstop,'' Durbin said.\n\nAdvocates, including some who had been in prison themselves, cornered senators \u2013 such as Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2013 in the halls and knocked on doors to tell their stories about life behind bars.\n\nGraham was already on board, but he spent 15 minutes in the hall talking with advocates from #cut50.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty hard ass on most criminal justice things, but we have a system that\u2019s just gotten to be bureaucratic,'' Graham said at a news conference Wednesday celebrating the vote. \"We\u2019re going to make sure if you do get out of jail under this bill, you have a better chance of not going back.\u201d\n\nLast week, Louis Reed and a team from #cut50 met with Lee, Grassley and Durbin.\n\nSince June, Reed, a national organizer for the group, has been to Washington 17 times to lobby for the bill. The group shifted its attention to Kentucky, McConnell's home state, after the senator said he wanted to hear from folks on the issue.\n\n\u201cHear from us is what he got,\u201d said Reed, who served 14 years in prison for, among other things, illegally possessing ammunition.\n\nThe group helped mobilize organizers in Kentucky, set up a phone bank and ramped up a social media campaign. They generated 30,000 calls to McConnell\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWe have sweated blood and tears behind this issue,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for another Congress. We can\u2019t wait for another midterm. We can\u2019t wait for another president. People\u2019s lives are literally hanging in the balance.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Jared Kushner, White House senior adviser and President Donald Trump's son-in-law, arrive Nov. 27 for the weekly Senate Republican policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, where they pushed criminal justice changes. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)\n\nThere was still fierce opposition from other Republicans.\n\nConservatives such as Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas blasted the bill, saying it would allow early release for too many people with violent criminal histories.\n\nCruz crafted an amendment that would exclude inmates who committed certain crimes from being eligible for early release.\n\nWith a nod from bill sponsors and the White House to include his language, Cruz added his name to the list of supporters Dec. 7. That list grew to 34 by Dec. 10.\n\nCotton didn't get on board but was promised a vote on amendments he proposed with Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.

(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this year, a federal district court judge ruled that Florida\u2019s current system for determining whether a former felon should regain the right to vote is arbitrary and unconstitutional.\n\nThat unconstitutional system makes Amendment 4, which Floridians will see on their ballots Tuesday, an incredibly important measure. Its passage would restore voting rights to more than 1 million Floridians who have successfully completed prison sentences. Voting rights for former felons, which would not apply to those who have been convicted of murder or sexual offenses, would benefit everyone.\n\nOur democracy thrives when more people participate. When citizens have paid their debts, we should encourage them to work, to pay taxes, to contribute to their communities and, as voters, to fully participate in our democracy. Our society should lift all restrictions, not just voting, that stop those things from becoming reality. Laws restrict felons from getting licenses that allow them to work and from getting housing and educational assistance.\n\nAll three branches of Florida\u2019s government are involved in establishing and enforcing our laws. The state legislature decides what is a crime and the range of appropriate penalties. The police make arrests, and the state attorney\u2019s office, which is part of the executive branch, prosecutes and recommends sentences and other penalties to the judge, who makes the final sentencing decision. Once the time is served, voting should be fully open. That\u2019s only fair.\n\nBut unlike in 46 other states, it doesn\u2019t work that way in Florida. Instead, a returning citizen must wait at least five years to apply for clemency before a board that meets only four times a year. The board can deny clemency for any reason. As Florida's governor has frequently said, there is no standard for giving or denying clemency in his state.\n\nThe Florida Commission on Offender Review has found that the majority of people who regain that eligibility do not reoffend. This means that allowing returning citizens to vote would make our communities safer. It would also boost Florida\u2019s economy by $365 million a year, according to a study by the Washington Economics Group (an economics consulting firm) by reducing the cost of incarceration and increasing the likelihood that returning citizens work and pay taxes.\n\nI became a judge in order to serve the public and to make this state a better place.

McGlockton had parked in the store\u2019s handicapped space, which irritated Drejka and led to a confrontation.\n\nTold that a man was shouting at his girlfriend, McGlockton rushed from the store and pushed Drejka to the ground in an apparent effort to defend Jacobs and his young children inside the car. As McGlockton backed away, Drejka drew his gun and fired.\n\nDrejka is white. He has a concealed carry permit and a history of confrontation, but the sheriff who is also white dismissed Drejka\u2019s past as irrelevant to the shooting. McGlockton and Jacobs are black.\n\nFlorida\u2019s stand your ground statue gives a person the right to use deadly force \u2014 without a \u201cduty to retreat.\u201d Drejka told deputies he had to shoot to defend himself, Gualtieri said. Citing the high burden of evidence on the state to show that Drejka was unable to use stand your ground as a legal defense, the sheriff opted against making an arrest.\n\nImagine if Drejka had been black and McGlockton a white man defending his family? Does anyone believe a black shooter would escape arrest due to stand your ground, much less avoid getting fatally shot by police? That\u2019s another problem with the law: its inconsistent application, which usually works against people of color.\n\nSean Pittman is the senior partner of Pittman Law Group, a Tallahassee-based law firm with statewide operations that specializes in government, administrative and corporate law. This was excerpted from a column that originally appeared in the Tallahassee Democrat, a part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nLetter edited for clarity and length:\n\nI\u2019m very glad that Michael Drejka has been charged in the shooting death of Markeis McGlockton and that he was put behind bars. He is a genuine menace to society. I live in Clearwater, Florida, and I work close to where the incident took place. According to reports, this isn\u2019t the first time that Drejka has been aggressive.\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if Drejka would have acted out in such a bold fashion if former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush hadn\u2019t signed \u201cstand your ground\u201d into law in the first place.\n\nBush did that in 2005, standing right next to National Rifle Association lobbyist Marion Hammer.\n\nI would love the opportunity to ask Bush if he had it to do all over again (given all the that has happened), whether he would still sign it into law.\n\nJoAnn Lee Frank; Clearwater, Fla.\n\nFacebook comments edited for clarity:\n\nMichael Drejka should have been charged immediately in the death of Markeis McGlockton.

The shooter could easily have pulled the gun and used it just as a deterrent. He didn\u2019t have to fire!\n\nLarry Stonebridge\n\nWhat others are saying about 'stand your ground'\n\nJacob Sullum, New York Post: \"Markeis McGlockton and Michael Drejka both overreacted during their brief, fatal encounter in the parking lot of a Florida convenience store. McGlockton overreacted by pushing Drejka to the ground, and Drejka overreacted by drawing a pistol and shooting McGlockton in the chest. Although it is hard to see how Drejka\u2019s use of lethal force could have been justified, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri declined to arrest him, claiming his hands were tied by Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground law. But that is not true, and Gualtieri\u2019s misrepresentation of the law has renewed misguided criticism of Florida\u2019s approach to self-defense, which contrary to popular misconception does not give a free pass to armed hotheads who claim to have fired out of fear. ... The signature feature of Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground law, as the moniker suggests, is that people attacked in public places do not have a duty to retreat. But that rule, which most states have adopted and Gualtieri said he supports, did not figure in the sheriff\u2019s decision. Gualtieri emphasized that someone who legally uses force in self-defense is immune from arrest under Florida law. But he never satisfactorily explained why that description applies to Michael Drejka.\"\n\nMarion Hammer, the NRA, Politico: \"Nothing in either the 2005 law or the 2017 law prohibits a sheriff from making an arrest in a case where a person claims self-defense if there is probable cause that the use of force was unlawful. ... Nothing in the law says a person can sue the sheriff for making an arrest when there is probable cause.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay Times, editorial: \"Before a jury ever hears the evidence against Drejka, he will be entitled to an immunity hearing if he claims self-defense in the case. Last year, the legislature amended the stand your ground law and made it even more insidious, flipping the burden of proof in such hearings to the prosecution. Now the state must show with 'clear and convincing evidence' why a person should not be immune \u2014 instead of requiring a defendant who has killed someone to show why he shouldn\u2019t have to stand trial. That\u2019s both backward and dangerous. Monday\u2019s decision to bring a criminal case against Drejka is a positive step that will allow the public to see all the evidence and hear both sides of what led to McGlockton\u2019s death. Like all criminal defendants, Drejka is entitled to a presumption of innocence and a fair process. But the process in Florida, as it stands now, has been tilted out of balance and needs correcting. Lawmakers should start by scrapping the stand your ground law.\"\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY, email letters@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2MePwOr"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/spotlight/2019/01/16/incarceration-drugs-nyu-former-inmate-first-step-act-policing-the-usa/2575294002/", "text": "FIRST STEP Act must be applauded, but next generation of advocates understand need for further community-based reforms like the ones that helped me.\n\nCyntoia Brown was granted clemency this month by Tennessee Gov.

Other days, I would find myself wondering how I had gotten there.\n\nTerrance Coffie spent 19 years in the system before becoming a professor at New York University. (Photo: Terrance Coffie)\n\nStudents discussed the history of the criminal justice system, its impact on communities of color and its cost to the American people. As a professor, my role was to prepare my students to face the challenges and realities of their careers and to inspire them to want to make a difference.\n\nIt was during one of our discussions about the possible passage of the FIRST STEP Act that I found myself not only inspired but also hopeful for America's future and the future of criminal justice reform.\n\nMy students agreed that the FIRST STEP Act was necessary, arguing that sentencing reform is the only way to truly address discriminatory practices within the criminal justice system. But they took their argument a step further, questioning what most people don't. They asked what services were available to assist inmates once they were released \u2014 an important issue criminal justice reform fails to address.\n\nNearly 77 percent of those released are rearrested within five years, according to a National Institute of Justice report. Provisions within the FIRST STEP Act would allocate $375 million in federal funding for job training and education programs in prisons \u2014 a good first step, but a more comprehensive and holistic approach will be needed.\n\nI earned my GED in 1993 at Florida's Marion Correctional Institution, while serving a five-year sentence for possession with intent to sell. I had spent more than 19 years of my life in the cycle of incarceration. In the 1990s, politicians were campaigning on tough-on-crime policies. Millions of young men such as myself knew that meant get tough on blacks. Public sentiment and political dogma, like that of Hillary Clinton at the time, referred to us as \"superpredators.\" Words such as re-entry and reform were political suicide.\n\nI was 40 years old before I enrolled in an institution of higher learning \u2014 Bronx Community College in 2010. After that, I was offered a scholarship to NYU, where I earned a bachelor's degree and then a master's.\n\nWhat got me into and through those programs had much less to do with what I experienced while incarcerated, and everything to do with transitional services and groups that I was fortunate enough to encounter after I was released: College Initiative, an organization that assists formerly incarcerated men with higher education; and The Doe Fund, which helps with job placement, education and housing. A year after graduating from NYU, I was contacted by the coordinator of university programs and asked whether I would consider teaching this course.\n\nThe formerly incarcerated should have access to immediate employment opportunities, as well as educational and career training once they re-enter society.\n\nStates should develop and implement sound re-entry policies that reduce recidivism rates, promote public safety, and offer offenders opportunities that truly reflect a second chance.\n\nStudents aiming to be lawyers and justice reform advocates already get it. I saw that each week when I entered my classroom. I heard the humanity in my students' voices. They challenged stark contradictions within our criminal justice system. They expressed determination to make a difference.\n\nOn the last day of class, one of my students asked me why I was so passionate about this work. I began my answer by revealing my prisoner ID number. I had never divulged that before. I hadn't even told them I was a former inmate.\n\nSome students stared in amazement. Others shared personal stories of family members and friends who had also been incarcerated. Those students wanted to make a difference for their loved ones.

One such barrier was lifted last week.\n\nSince 2006, the Common Application, used by over 750 colleges and universities to standardize the online application process, required prospective students to respond to a question about their juvenile and criminal history.

But there remains opportunity for individual colleges and universities to continue using criminal history information against applicants.\n\nThese institutions have broad discretion to add questions about a young person\u2019s history with law enforcement or the justice system. Colleges can then use this information to conduct official background checks of students. Two-thirds of colleges and universities collect criminal justice information during the admissions process.

(Photo: Brad Vest, The Commercial Appeal, via USA T)\n\nStudents at thousands of schools across the nation are planning to stage walkouts Friday to mark the 19th year since the Columbine High School massacre, an attack that marked a new era of gun violence.\n\nMore than 2,300 events are planned for the National School Walkout, the latest mass protest organized by a student-led gun-control movement forged after a Valentine's Day shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.\n\nA Connecticut high school student started planning the walkouts the day of the Florida shooting. Lane Murdock, a sophomore at Ridgefield High School, says she hopes this walkout will rejuvenate the #NeverAgain movement and continue the dialogue about gun-control measures, including a ban on assault-styled weapons.\n\n\"Keeping up the momentum is important,\" Murdock said. \"We saw that low after March for Our Lives, but students aren't quitting on this. Our generation is demanding change and won't be ignored or swept under the rug.\"\n\nMore: At 1 million plus strong, March for Our Lives rallies make powerful statement\n\nMore: 'We deserve better': Students nationwide walk out in massive protest over gun violence\n\nMurdock, whose school is about 15 miles from Newtown, Conn., where 27 were killed in a rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, said she decided to take a stand and plan the walkouts because of her immediate reaction to the shooting in Parkland at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\n\"I really felt quite numb to it. Our whole country is pretty desensitized to gun violence and once I realized I was, too, it really scared me,\" she said. \"I was no longer surprised that people were dying. That shouldn't be the case.\"\n\nThere have been other protests since the Parkland shooting. More than a million people gathered for the March for Our Lives rallies in Washington and across the nation on March 24. On March 14, students staged the first nationwide walkout. And students talked gun control with lawmakers at town halls in recent weeks.\n\n\"I think a lot of people see this as the finale, but no, it's still just the beginning of this movement,\" Murdock said, adding that organizers have estimated more than 1 million students plan to participate Friday.\n\nShe said the biggest difference between the previous nationwide walkout is that hers encourages students to continue protesting all day, instead of the 17-minute rallies many schools held.\n\nThe walkouts are scheduled to start at 10 a.m., and students will take 13 seconds to honor the 13 killed at Columbine High School in 1999. After that, it's up to students what they decide to do next: There will be open mics and early voter registrations.\n\nFollow Christal Hayes on Twitter: Journo_Christal.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2H8qBta"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/19/pregnant-waitress-police-officer-tip-note/2916029002/", "text": "CLOSE Police officer leaves $100 tip on $8 diner check for pregnant South Jersey waitress.

But in most states they cannot be employed as police officers. Now dozens of police chiefs and sheriffs, alarmed at the shrinking numbers of qualified recruits, want to see the long-standing prohibition lifted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think someone\u2019s citizenship is indicative in any way of someone\u2019s suitability to be a police officer,\u201d said Tom Manger, police chief in Montgomery County, Maryland, a suburb of Washington D.C. He co-chairs a national task force of policing executives lobbying legislatures to change the law in Maryland and elsewhere.\n\nThe movement is part of a broader recognition that the difficulty in recruiting police is not just a result of low pay and battered morale\u2014the so-called Ferguson Effect\u2014but of numerous obstacles thrown up by politicians or police themselves.\n\nJurisdiction by jurisdiction, those barriers are being challenged, often successfully.\n\nA growing number of law enforcement agencies will now accept applicants who admit past drug use or have arrest records for low-level offenses, who lack college degrees and who sport tattoos or facial hair.\n\nBut frustrated cops say they are still being handcuffed by arcane state laws and slow-to-respond state oversight commissions.\n\nIn Massachusetts, officers and police applicants are disqualified if they smoke cigarettes, even off-duty.\n\nMatthew Starr, an army veteran who had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, was rejected by the police department in Medfield, Massachusetts, near Boston, after a police officer secretly photographed Starr getting out of his pickup to smoke. Starr appealed to the state\u2019s Civil Service Commission and lost.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to claim there is a shortage when you aren\u2019t going to hire someone who smokes,\u201d said Starr, who is now a 7th grade public school teacher. Being a cop \u201cis a tough job, there\u2019s no money, there is no respect in it, and these asinine laws don\u2019t help either.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts is also one of several states where women are challenging physical requirements that impede the hiring and retention of female officers. Critics argue the rules have little to do with the demands of policing.\n\nThe state requires women to traverse the same arduous obstacle course as men. The fail rate for women was 20 percent compared to a rate of 2 percent for men, according to a data analysis by news station WCVB. The Massachusetts Human Resources Division settled a lawsuit in 2015 with a promise to revise the test, but the reforms have yet to be announced. All five branches of the U.S. military, meanwhile, offer varied fitness standards for basic training based on gender. Beginning in late 2020, the Army will switch to a physical testing system for already enlisted soldiers based on the strain of their assignments rather than gender and age.\n\nMatthew Starr, a veteran of the U.S. Army, was rejected by the police department in Medfield, Massachusetts after he was photographed smoking.\n\n(Photo: Tony Luong for The Marshall Project)\n\nPolicing experts point out that law enforcement is historically slow to adapt to shifts in the cultural norms. Long after contact lenses were commonplace, police forces demanded 20/20 vision. Until the 1980s it was common for law enforcement agencies to shun gay cops on grounds that there would be \u201cmorale problems.\u201d\n\nMany police departments still ask applicants intrusive questions about their personal lives. A Marshall Project review of background check questionnaires found queries about \u201cunusual\u201d sexual acts (Cincinnati Police Department), attendance at cock or dog fights (Albuquerque Police Department) and whether an applicant has \u201cgiven anything to anyone that was not yours to give away\u201d. (Richmond Police Department in Virginia).\n\nNo issue is as fraught as the ban on applicants lacking full citizenship, at a time when President Trump has framed immigration as one of the country\u2019s most polarizing debates.\n\nAccording to a 2016 report by the U.S. Justice Department, more than 40 states have statutes, regulations, or administrative rules in place that restrict the ability of law enforcement agencies to employ non-citizens. The report, a survey of diversity in policing, notes that \u201cthis requirement may prevent a considerable number of racial and ethnic minorities\u2014many of whom have valuable foreign language skills\u2014from being hired by law enforcement agencies.\u201d\n\nMore: Chicago's policing problem is systemic. Truth and reconciliation are needed.\n\nMore: More cops. Is it the answer to fighting crime?\n\nMore: Black female senator: My arrest shows the bias that still exists in justice system\n\nJustin Levitt, a Justice Department official in the Obama administration, supervised discrimination cases against police departments that banned legal immigrants in the few states that allowed them to be hired as cops. Levitt questioned why legislatures continue to prevent police chiefs from employing who they want. \u201cThese laws tell local law enforcement that you have to hire someone less qualified based on the fact that they were born here,\u201d Levitt said.\n\nManger\u2019s group, called the Law Enforcement Immigration Task force, issued a white paper in 2017 urging that the citizenship requirement be lifted. Manger said the change might begin with legal immigrants who have been honorably discharged from the military.\n\n\u201cIf you criticize these individuals, then you are criticizing someone who has military service,\u201d Manger said. A bill to make green-card holders with military service eligible for policing died in the Maryland Senate last year, but its sponsor plans to reintroduce it.\n\nTennessee in 2015 amended its laws to open police recruitment to non-citizens with military service, after the police chief in Nashville rallied legislators. \"Having a cross-section of Nashville serving on the police department enhances our knowledge and appreciation of cultures so we can better serve our population,\u201d said then Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson after the law was changed.\n\nNot all jurisdictions in the state are following the reform. The Memphis Police Department still requires its applicants to be citizens. When the failure to comply with state law was brought to the city\u2019s attention, spokeswoman Ursula Madden said Memphis officials were \u201cin the process of updating the language.\u201d\n\nMontgomery County, Maryland, Police Chief Tom Manger has lobbied for the state to allow military veterans who are not citizens to be hired as police officers.\n\n(Photo: Gabriella Demczuk for The Marshall Project)\n\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo wants a broader change, and says he is talking with a bipartisan group of state legislators to craft a bill that would allow law enforcement agencies to hire legal non-citizens who qualify, with or without a military background. \u201cThey came here legally like we asked them to do, and they have the heart, let\u2019s remove that artificial wall, and let\u2019s build a bridge to service. That\u2019s what we should be doing,\u201d said Acevedo who co-chairs the immigration task force along with Manger.\n\nOpponents of allowing permanent residents to join police ranks say they don\u2019t want to empower green-card holders to detain U.S. citizens. They also question whether an immigrant, who didn\u2019t go through the naturalization process, could fairly practice constitutional policing. \u201cIf you want to become a cop, become a citizen,\u201d said former Illinois U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh who is now a nationally syndicated conservative radio host.\n\nIn 2015, Walsh\u2019s listeners flooded a village council meeting in suburban Chicago and loudly protested a proposal for the Mount Prospect Police Department to hire non-citizens. Due to the backlash, Mount Prospect officials dropped the idea. The police chief described the critics as a \u201clynch mob.\u201d\n\nThe right of states to restrict police recruiting based on citizenship rests on a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the New York State Police\u2019s refusal to accept the application of a legal permanent resident named Edmund Foley. \u201cPolice officials are clothed with authority to exercise an almost infinite variety of discretionary powers,\u201d the court ruled. \u201cA state may therefore confine the performance of this important public responsibility to those who are citizens.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the Obama administration fined the Denver sheriff's department $10,000 for incorrectly advertising that citizenship was a requirement for a deputy position. Colorado is one of a handful of states that allow non-citizens to apply for local law enforcement jobs. As part of the settlement, Denver agreed to track down green card holders who had been passed over for a job and reconsider them for employment.\n\nOne beneficiary of the new policy was Omar Barrios, a legal immigrant from Mexico but not yet a citizen. Now a deputy, he works at Denver\u2019s downtown detention center. \u201cNobody ever asks me if I am a resident or a citizen,\u201d he says. \u201cI do my job like anyone else.\u201d"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/humankind/2019/01/22/incarcerated-parents-bond-their-kids-through-books-and-activities/2649863002/", "text": "CLOSE This blessing of normalcy makes prison a little less scary for kids visiting their mom or dad. Humankind, USA TODAY\n\nATLANTA -- Having an incarcerated parent is traumatic for children. They are often a forgotten demographic, a forgotten victim. That's why Andrea Shelton is equipping those parents to be the best parents they can be while inside prison walls.\n\n\"People can be angry at people in prison, and so often the needs of the caregivers and the children are forgotten,\" explains Shelton, the president of HeartBound Ministries. \"I think it's so important that we bridge the gap between parent and child when they're separated by prison. This is not a place where you can just go any time and visit your parent.\"\n\nIn Georgia, there's an estimated 75,000 children with incarcerated parents. The state is high in incarceration rates and low in literacy. Shelton saw this as an opportunity for change.\n\nIn 2014, Shelton created HeartBound Ministries' Little Readers program, a personalized, recorded reading program allowing children of incarcerated parents to see and hear their mothers and fathers reading a book to them on DVD. Parents can choose from a variety of books to read; they can also pick out a different shirt to wear for the recording, so their child doesn't have to see them in their prison uniform.\n\nThe DVDs allow kids to see that their parent is okay and still loves them.\n\nAnne Van Pelt sits down to begin her recorded reading session for her 10-year-old daughter. (Photo: Daryl Bjoraas)\n\nA Community Thrives\n\nIn June 2018, Shelton received a call that changed the course of the Little Readers program. Her nonprofit won a grant of $50,000 through a USA TODAY NETWORK initiative called \"A Community Thrives.\"\n\nFilled with the excitement of all the possibilities, Shelton started with an idea she conceived in 2003: literacy carts.\n\n\"Having sat through visitations at least 16 months when my own brother was incarcerated, I just saw these kids and these signs that loomed in every visitation room, 'You're responsible for your children,' and they had to behave, right? I thought, 'Gosh, that's hard. To sit there that long when you're little with nothing to do,'\" recalls Shelton.\n\nShelton would sit in those rooms, just thinking of the possibilities.\n\nWith new resources and funding at her disposal, her dream became a reality. In the fall of 2018, Little Readers rolled out 68 literacy carts, filled with books, puzzles, flashcards, games and more. Parents can choose from 50 different titles to read with their little ones.\n\nIn addition to advancing literacy in visitation rooms, Shelton also used the grant money to expand the Little Readers program to new facilities and equip facilities with their own recording software, raising the amount of kids impacted from about 1,000 a year to more than 1,600 in 2018. Kids also have the opportunity to receive more DVDs and books throughout the year as more and more facilities gain their own equipment and can record more frequently.\n\n\"We could be changing outcomes here. We could be changing the direction of a child's future because they sat on their parent's lap when they were little in a visitation room, and they read,\" says Shelton.\n\nShelton hopes to continue expanding and to develop interactive workbooks for parents and their kids. She also has a message for other states:\n\n\"There should be a literacy cart in every prison in the country. Maybe Georgia will start the trend.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/humankind/2019/01/22/incarcerated-parents-bond-their-kids-through-books-and-activities/2649863002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/12/05/new-york-police-department-deploys-drone-fleet-searches-events/2212569002/", "text": "CLOSE The New York Police Department has a new fleet of 14 drones.

(the Sheriff's Anti-Violence Effort) that use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a psychological treatment that focuses on helping young men recognize their instinctual responses and slow down their thinking in high-stake situations, have gained popularity in several cities around the U.S. in recent years.\n\nThe sheriff's office, which runs one of the nation\u2019s biggest jails, is betting that the therapy can help some of Chicago's incarcerated population get a better handle on their impulses \u2013 and in the process, reduce the city\u2019s persistent gun violence.\n\nMany participants will likely find themselves jailed again: 43 percent of Illinois offenders are charged within three years of being released from incarceration, according to the state's sentencing policy advisory council.\n\nBut sheriff's officials say if they can help the young men \u2013 who come from one of Chicago's 15 most-violent ZIP codes \u2013 even slightly shift their decision-making capabilities, the impact for the individuals and their communities will be significant.

The sheriff's office, which has two jail staffers who work full time on S.A.V.E. and six others who work part time, said it costs about $285,000 annually to operate.\n\nThe participants all volunteer for the program and must express a desire to make sweeping changes in their lives.\n\nMany come from rival gangs but agree to set aside differences they might have on the street to take part in the program. Typically, administrators at the jail try to segregate gang rivals.\n\n\u201cYou throw a little bit of the rule book out the window,\u201d Dart said. \u201cIf you go on our S.A.V.E. tier, there are people, who if they\u2019re on the outside right now, are shooting at each other.\u201d\n\nCook County Sheriff Tom Dart says the S.A.V.E. program has met its objective if a participant returned to the community, 'didn\u2019t shoot anybody and wasn\u2019t shot by anybody.' (Photo: John Zich, Special to USA TODAY)\n\nOnly a fraction of detainees who started the program stick with it long term.\n\nThe sheriff's office said it is still working with or in touch with 98 of the 679 participants who opted into S.A.V.E. since its launch. The participants include several who were in S.A.V.E. for a matter of days.\n\nMore than 200 of the participants were expelled for fighting, repeated disrespect of S.A.V.E. officials or other unspecified infractions, according to sheriff's office data. Eighty-four participants opted out while they were still jailed and were returned to the general population.\n\nAfter S.A.V.E participants leave jail, the sheriff\u2019s department steers them to anti-violence groups on the outside that offer services such as job training and continued therapy. It ultimately is up to participants to follow through.\n\nThe participants are facing a gamut of serious charges but are likely to spend all or most of their incarcerated time in the county jail. About 81 percent of Cook County detainees are returned directly to their communities without entering the state prison system.\n\nIn this May 30, 2016 file photo, police work the scene where a man was fatally shot in the chest in Chicago's Washington Park neighborhood.

Jason Wambsgans, AP)\n\nSuccess and failure\n\nIn the early going for S.A.V.E., there have been hits and misses.\n\nRandy Leflore, 21, spent about seven months in S.A.V.E. before a judge agreed to release him on electronic monitoring in June 2017 while he awaits trial.\n\nLeflore, a former gang member, ended up in jail after allegedly carrying out three armed robberies of laundromats. He was also in possession of a replica firearm when he was arrested, according to prosecutors.\n\nLeflore pleaded not guilty to the charges but acknowledges he was in a bad place when he was arrested. He credits S.A.V.E. with helping him restart his life.\n\n\u201cThe important thing I got out of S.A.V.E. was to change the way I think,\u201d said Leflore, who has been working part-time jobs at McDonald's and Corner Bakery restaurants since his release from jail. \u201cBasically, it was like I had a criminal mindset. I thought there ain\u2019t no way I could change.\u201d\n\nLeflore said he recently used what he learned in therapy after one of his gang buddies was fatally shot by a rival in their neighborhood, Englewood, an enclave on the city\u2019s South Side hard hit by gun violence.\n\n\u201cWhen someone dies in Englewood \u2026 the first thing that comes to mind is retaliation,\u201d Leflore said. \u201cWhen things like that happen now I just sit.\"\n\nNot all S.A.V.E. participants have managed to avoid gun violence after getting out.\n\nCourtney Lewis, 20, spent fewer than 40 days in S.A.V.E. in late 2016 and early 2017 after being charged with unlawful use of a weapon and felony possession of a firearm after police officers found a gun on him following a traffic stop. Lewis was prohibited from possessing a firearm because of a previous gun-related conviction.\n\nIn January 2017, a relative posted the $7,500 Lewis needed to bond out of jail. He returned home while his case plodded along in the county court system, court records show.\n\nLess than three months after his release, Lewis was shot and another man was wounded when a gunman opened fire on the vehicle they were riding in, police said. In addition to those killed, seven former participants \u2013 including four who were expelled from S.A.V.E. \u2013 ended up back in jail on charges related to discharging a firearm, according to the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nLewis died from his wounds several days after the incident and became one of three S.A.V.E. participants killed in gun violence after leaving the program.\n\nLewis spoke regularly with S.A.V.E. officials at least for part of the time he was out on bail, but he eventually fell out of touch and was listed as inactive in the program three days before he was gunned down, according to sheriff's records.\n\n\u201cThat was big on the whole S.A.V.E. program,\" said Leflore, who knew Lewis before they spent time in S.A.V.E. together. \"I think a lot of participants learned a lesson from Courtney Lewis \u2026 to stay out of the streets.\u201d\n\nCook County Jail inmate Romell Young conducts a mock job interview with another inmate at the jail's S.AV.E. program.

(Photo: Aamer Madhani/ USA Today)\n\nHitting bottom\n\nOther S.A.V.E. participants say their efforts to reform are similar to a drug addict or alcoholic trying to get sober in that relapse is often a pitfall in the path toward recovery.\n\nRomell Young, 23, who is back in jail after being arrested on an unlawful use of weapon charge, started his third stint in the S.A.V.E. program in late May. His two earlier stints were after arrests for drug possession charges.\n\nFor the first weeks of his current jail stay, Young needed to use a cane to walk. He was seriously wounded the month before he was arrested after he said he beat up a man in a fistfight near his home.\n\nWeeks after being shot, police said they received a call from a concerned resident about an armed man on the street fitting Young\u2019s description.\n\nWhen police arrived, Young allegedly tried to flee and during a brief pursuit threw his jacket, according to court records. The responding officer discovered a firearm in the area near where Young allegedly threw the coat.\n\nThrough S.A.V.E.'s individual counseling, he said he\u2019s come to realize that he\u2019s never fully dealt with parental abandonment issues from his childhood. The therapy sessions, he said, have also taught him coping techniques to deal with adversity, and he has a better grip on his anger.\n\nSo why does he keep putting himself in dangerous situations?\n\n\u201cI need someone to stand on me,\u201d Young said. \u201cIf this program could be outside in the world, it would be better for us.\u201d\n\nRecently, he felt like he hit bottom. On Father\u2019s Day, his mother brought his 9-month-old son to the jail to visit him. His child wanted to touch him, but a glass divider in the jail\u2019s visiting room made it impossible.\n\n\u201cHe started busting out crying,\u201d Young recalled. \u201cThat was the moment I realized, and I prayed about it.

Andrew Ford, @AndrewFordNews\n\nWhat does it take to rid New Jersey of bad cops?\n\nBackbone on the part of police chiefs, judges and public officials would help. But what New Jersey needs most is a formal, centralized process for removing rogue cops that takes the decision out of the hands of local police departments.\n\nTwo more examples of the need for an independent state licensing and review board came to light recently with the arrest of a Long Branch cop on charges of criminal sexual contact and harassment of a 21-year-old woman, and the decision by a state Office of Administrative Law judge to allow five Hackensack police officers whom the city found guilty of unlawfully breaking into an apartment and falsifying a police report to return to active duty.\n\nLong Branch police officer Patrick Joyce Jr. seen here in a file photo. (Photo: File Photo)\n\nDon't police officers, like everyone else, deserve their day in court? Yes. But the evidence should be weighed by a panel free of internal politics, one that holds law enforcement officers to the highest standards of integrity. Clearly, as our The Shield series and numerous updates to it have demonstrated, the current process is working. Decisions about whether, and how severely, to discipline police officers shouldn't be left to individual departments, each with their own set of rules, internal investigation protocols about what constitutes unacceptable behavior.\n\nIn the Long Branch case, the officer recently charged with criminal sexual contact, Patrick Joyce Jr., had pleaded guilty in 2011 to aggravated assault after he and another officer were involved in an off-duty fight that left a third man with a broken jaw. Joyce accepted a plea bargain that resulted in a year's probation.\n\nCLOSE From the courthouse to town hall to Trenton, New Jersey governments built a secret system that protects bad cops while taxpayers pick up the bill. Andrew Ford, @AndrewFordNews\n\nIn many other states, Joyce would have been kicked off the force and prohibited from being a cop in any other department. That's what needs to happen in New Jersey.\n\nIn 31 states, the state agencies involved with training and licensing police officers also have the authority to revoke the license or certificate of a police officer guilty of various types of misconduct spelled out by state law or administrative regulations. In Florida, a commission has broad authority to decertify police officers.\n\nAPP impact: NJ combats rogue cops after The Shield\n\nPolice brutality in New Jersey can be stopped. Here's how.\n\nStop settling for, and with, rogue cops: Bergmann\n\nFor our story about Joyce, New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association President Pat Colligan was asked whether there are adequate safeguards in place to ensure that the state's police officers act appropriately. He responded in an email that Joyce had been charged: \"... Is that somehow not an adequate safeguard?\"\n\nHardly. If New Jersey had a system in place that was weighted more toward protecting citizens than bad cops, things might have turned out differently. What is certain is that until New Jersey joins the ranks of states that make the safety of residents and the integrity of police officers a priority, rogue cops will continue to put the public at risk.\n\nIn response to our story, state Sen. Vin Gopal, D-Monmouth, pledged to pursue legislation to stop bad cops from keeping their jobs. That's a pledge voters in his district should demand he keep.\n\nSupport our Signature Journalism Become an Asbury Park Press subscriber today and get unlimited digital access and support stories like this one.

Courier Journal\n\nA now-fired Louisville Metro Police officer who was captured on school surveillance video hitting two different teenagers within five days of each other is fighting to get his job back.\n\nJonathan Hardin is suing over the decision of the Louisville Metro Police Merit Board, which decided last month to uphold Chief Steve Conrad\u2019s decision to fire him in March 2015.\n\nHardin was fired from the department in March 2015, one month after he was criminally charged with assault in two cases stemming from altercations with 13-year-old students.\n\nBut charges were dismissed in one case that was later expunged and Hardin was acquitted of charges in the other.\n\nTeacher fired: Educator comes out as bisexual to stop a suicide, then gets fired\n\nThe lawsuit against Louisville Metro Government and the merit board argues Conrad\u2019s decision to fire him was \u201cunjustified\u201d and that the board\u2019s decision was based on evidence that came from the expunged case.\n\nThe merit board, according to the suit, found that the dismissal of criminal charges didn\u2019t prevent the police department or the merit board from making decisions \u201cbased on the underlying conduct.\u201d\n\nJonathan Hardin\n\nSurveillance video from Jan. 27, 2015, shows Hardin was monitoring Olmsted Academy North students as they passed through a lobby when a 13-year-old knocked Hardin to the floor.\n\nThe officer walked over to the retreating student, wrapped his arm around the teen and lifted him off the ground for about six seconds, causing the teen to pass out.\n\nA departmental investigation found Hardin violated a number of policies in using \"unwarranted\" force against the teen.\n\n\"There is no way to justify the use of this prohibited technique, which jeopardized the life of\" the boy, Conrad wrote in a letter to Hardin.\n\nFloodwater rescue: Group spends the night atop a Jeep after getting stranded\n\nLast summer, a jury cleared Hardin of all charges after an hour of deliberation.\n\nHardin told jurors he never intended to use a chokehold on the student.\n\n\"You just knocked a police officer over,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cYou have to gain control of the situation.\"\n\nHardin was originally charged with second-degree assault, first-degree wanton endangerment and first-degree official misconduct, though jurors were instructed to deliberate on fourth-degree assault and second-degree misconduct as well as the wanton endangerment charge.\n\nHardin was also charged with fourth-degree assault, first-degree official misconduct and false swearing in connection to a Jan. 22 incident at the school.\n\nProsecutors agreed to drop those charges in exchange for Hardin agreeing to undergo an anger-management assessment and follow through with any treatment. The charges have since been expunged.\n\nVideo of the incident shows Hardin speaking with a 13-year-old student in the lunchroom for more than a minute before he pushes, then punches the teen in the face.\n\nBoeheim car crash: Man dies after being hit by Syracuse coach\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, the two were talking because Hardin believed the teen had cut the lunch line.\n\nHardin then charged the student with menacing and resisting arrest but lacked probable cause, according to an arrest warrant.\n\nHardin appealed the chief\u2019s decision and objected to the department\u2019s plan to use records from his expunged case as well as other transcribed witness statements as part of his merit board hearing.\n\nThe board \u2014 made up of five civilian members and two officers elected by police union members \u2014 heard the case in August 2018 and in January finalized a vote keeping Hardin off the force.\n\nHardin called out \u201ccontradictory\u201d findings by the board in the suit, filed by attorney David Leightty in Jefferson Circuit Court this month.\n\nHepatitis A: How the disease spread across Kentucky and grew into the nation's largest outbreak\n\nHe took issue with the board\u2019s characterization of the physical act between him and one of the teens as a \u201cbump\u201d \u2014 calling it a \u201cbody blow\u201d \u2014 while noting the board also acknowledged it knocked him to the floor.\n\nBoard members concluded they couldn\u2019t definitively say Hardin intentionally used a choke hold on the teen, according to the suit, but called his actions \u201cinappropriate\u201d and opined that he was perhaps embarrassed that a 13-year-old knocked him off his feet.\n\nAt the time of the incidents, Hardin was a school resource officer, a police officer assigned to work inside JCPS schools.\n\nThe suit demands Hardin be reinstated with back pay and benefits.\n\nCLOSE A JCPS surveillance video shows School Resource Officer Jonathan Hardin place a 13-year-old boy in a chokehold after the boy pushed him to the ground.

Lennorris Barber (Photo: Your Turn)\n\nTowne South Shopping Center is one of the only places on the south side available to house black businesses. Placing the police headquarters there will eliminate one of the limited venues for economic development in the African-American community.\n\nThis is a testament to the level of commitment the city has to inclusion of south side indigenous in its economic development initiative. If the center is removed, where will the indigenous of the south side house the business startups that Office of Economic Vitality promises to create? These are the silent weapons of the quiet war that exclude African-Americans from the local economy.\n\nThe Towne South Shopping Center is half empty because the shopping center management does nothing to actively recruit and retain African-American businesses. Jack McLean Park is really the best option for a south side location for a police headquarters. It will save the city some money and it will not have a negative impact on prospective future economic advances for the indigenous.\n\nRemoving this commercial space from an already short inventory closes doors of opportunity in our face and creates an economic vacuum that will suck more crime into the area.\n\nWhile the police chief may want to build a better relationship with the south side community, the current culture of the police department is embedded in the rank and file. That culture is to serve and protect on the north side but on the south side it's to servile and arrest. As such, a departmental cultural paradigm shift is required. Merely locating a new, so-called citizen-friendly police headquarters on the south side will not accomplish the necessary departmental cultural change. It is just poor public policy!\n\nThe chambers of commerce should be opposed to this move, especially the minority chambers.\n\nFormer Commissioner Scott Maddox and former Mayor Andrew Gillum believed the city could save money by building the Public Safety Complex at Jack McLean Park. Maddox stated the shopping center presents the same problems as TPD's current site: it abuts a single-family neighborhood and it doesn't allow good entry and exit.\n\nWhen Blueprint economic development funding becomes available, where will the indigenous of the south side house retail establishments? While OEV may present pseudo opportunities, there will not be venues for south side businesses. Taking this venue offline ahead of the rollout of the city/county economic development initiative ensures exclusion of the indigenous of the south side. Additionally, the area is considered a food desert. Displacing a grocery store aggravates that problem.\n\nGiven all the adverse impacts (cost ineffectiveness and social economic discord) of the selection of the Towne South Shopping Center site, it appears that this transaction is merely another crony capitalistic political decision designed to fatten the pockets of an elite to the detriment of the people of the south side.\n\nK.

Blaine Whited explains how car thefts by juveniles can lead to other crimes and escalate other issues. Ayrika L Whitney, The Tennessean\n\nNew legislation set to take effect in July would limit what crimes police departments in the state could detain juveniles for. Now the Hendersonville Police Department is asking city officials to reach out to Sumner County representatives and Gov. Bill Lee to ask for changes.\n\nHendersonville Police Chief Mickey Miller is asking city officials to reach out to state officials to ask for tighter legislation when it comes to detaining juvenile criminals. (Photo: Matthew Diggs / For the Tennessean Sumner)\n\nFormer Gov. Bill Haslam created an 18-member panel to advocate for continued justice reform at the end of his term. The new Juvenile Justice Reform Implementation Council will oversee reforms he signed into law in the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018.\n\nThe bill was originally meant to drastically shrink the number of juveniles detained for minor offenses like missing school. However, lawmakers amended the plan to allow judges to detain youth for those offenses on a case-by-case basis.\n\nUnder the originally proposed bill, there were also stricter rules to prevent some cases from being transferred to adult court, but those limits were scaled back after negotiations, according to a previous Tennessean report.\n\nJuvenile crime in Hendersonville\n\nHendersonville Police Chief Mikey Miller explained how the Juvenile Justice Reform Act could impact the city at the Feb. 12 board of mayor and aldermen meeting.\n\nAccording to Miller, once the act takes effect July 1, the department will no longer be able to detain juveniles for burglary and car theft. Carjackings, he explained, were added back into the act. While some may argue those are minor offenses, Miller said the same juveniles committing these crimes are committing shootings and murders in Nashville.\n\n\"Two years ago this coming April, the gangs of Nashville have found Hendersonville,\" Miller said. \"They start out by breaking into cars. It may seem minor, but it's part of an overall problem. They're stealing cars ... they'll carjack you. Some of the people we've arrested have been involved in multiple shootings ... and several murders in Nashville.\"\n\nSo far, Miller said, the department has locked up more than 80 criminals responsible for burglaries and car thefts in Hendersonville. He credited the Sumner County District Attorney's office and judges for \"putting them away, and doing something about it.\"\n\nHendersonville Police: We hold criminals accountable\n\n\"We're relentless in going after these guys,\" Miller said. \"Some people say it's just a car theft. It's a whole lot more. These are the groups that are arriving and hurting people and killing people.\"\n\nTwo main gangs are responsible for 90 percent of these types of crimes in the city, Miller said. He also said that Hendersonville has a reputation for finding these criminals and locking them up, even if they leave the city. The new legislation, he explained, could hinder their efforts.\n\n\"It's very important, I think, and I'm very passionate about this,\" Miller said, asking the board for their help in contacting local and state officials about the issue.\n\nHendersonville Mayor Jamie Clary and the public safety committee said they would work with the police department to come up with a resolution to take to state representatives and the governor in hopes of amending the law\n\nOther cities weigh in\n\nGallatin Police Chief Donald Bandy said with so much overlap between criminals and the crimes they are committing, municipalities from Franklin and Brentwood to Gallatin, Hendersonville and Murfreesboro are working together to combat the issue.\n\nMiller said area police chiefs met Monday to discuss next steps.

Most states, including South Carolina, have no oversight into how often police seize money from people, who they seize it from or how much law enforcement profits.\n\nThe TAKEN investigation scoured every civil asset forfeiture case in South Carolina, more than 3,200 cases involving more than 4,000 people from 2014 to 2016, and found surprising results in a first-of-its-kind investigation.\n\nHere are 5 takeaways:\n\n1. Police seize millions of dollars each year\n\nAgencies in South Carolina seized more than $17 million from people over the course of three years. The bulk of that money ends up in the hands of law enforcement to pay for drug crime fighting. Police in South Carolina use the money to buy parts for helicopters, lunches at training sessions, ballistic vests and other equipment and in some places to pay for the department\u2019s K-9 unit.\n\nMore: TAKEN: How police departments make millions by seizing property\n\n2. In your state, civil forfeiture may not be used heavily at all.\n\nNebraska, New Mexico and North Carolina have eliminated civil forfeiture, while 29 states have enacted reforms to place some limits on forfeiture in recent years, according to the Institute for Justice, a reform advocacy law practice. Motivating factors for the state changes mainly centered on property owner protection and elimination of profit incentives for police.\n\n3. Police often don\u2019t make an arrest.\n\nWe found almost 800 times when police seized money or property when no related criminal charge could be found in the court system. In another 800 cases, someone was charged with a crime but was not convicted. Often the civil case still proceeded.\n\nAs part of recent reforms, 15 states have made forfeiture dependent on a criminal conviction. South Carolina has not enacted any reform, though two bills were filed in late 2018 and a third bill was filed this week.\n\n4. Black men bear the brunt of forfeiture cases.\n\nIn South Carolina, 65 percent of all forfeiture cases involved black men, though black men make up just 13 percent of the state\u2019s population.\n\nSome places showed an even wider disparity. In Myrtle Beach, 82 percent of forfeiture cases were filed against black men. They make up 13 percent of the city\u2019s population.\n\n5. Your cash disappears in minutes. It may take years to get it back.\n\nProsecutors in South Carolina have up to two years after police take your money to file a civil court case justifying the seizure. They often take nearly that long. On average, the investigation found that when a person petitions to have their money or property returned, the case takes 17 months to be resolved from the time your money was taken, even if you did nothing wrong. Your other option? Hire your own lawyer and sue the police to try to get it sooner.\n\nForfeiture has been a hot topic recently at the federal level. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration put some limits on sharing civil forfeiture cases between state and federal agencies, but President Donald Trump\u2019s administration rolled back those limits.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court heard a case in November that could impact civil forfeiture at the state level. The court is expected to rule in Timbs vs. Indiana on whether the Eighth Amendment\u2019s clause on excessive fines applies to forfeiture at the state level.\n\nCLOSE Ella Bromell: Conway forfeiture fight keeps her indoors now, fearful of losing her home. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go nowhere else.\u201d Lauren Petracca, The Greenville News\n\nHave a news tip about civil forfeiture for our investigative journalists?

One man drove from Michigan; another was passing through from New York to perhaps somewhere more exciting.\n\nIt was late spring in 2014, and the two highways that bisect this tiny rural village thronged with beach traffic. Most of the motorists were from out of state, bound for nearby Myrtle Beach until they were pulled over.\n\nIn case after case, their money was confiscated because an officer said the cash was found near drugs. Yet few motorists ever were arrested.\n\nThey were caught in one of the most aggressive civil forfeiture operations in the state. Their stories were among the dozens of similar tales from this sleepy stretch of South Carolina with a police force that seized and kept nearly $50,000 from unsuspecting motorists over a two-year period \u2014 the equivalent of $135 for every person living in Nichols.\n\nThat\u2019s six times more per resident than any other police department in the state. The next highest, the Yemassee Police Department, serves a jurisdiction about three times the size of Nichols, and seized $21 per capita.\n\nWe found the story of Nichols by analyzing data gathered in a two-year examination of forfeiture cases made by every law enforcement agency in the state from 2014-2016.\n\nOf the 10 police departments that seized the most money per capita, six served jurisdictions of 4,000 people or less. With a population of 358, Nichols stood out for the profit its police department made.\n\nPolice officials from that era have said their highway effort in Nichols was meant to reduce crime. Other than that, they have declined to explain the program.\n\nThe record of active civil forfeiture there is evidence trapped in amber because Hurricane Matthew damaged and deeply changed Nichols toward the end of our study period data. This place is no longer the same as it was in 2014 and 2015 \u2014 and its policing, like everything else in Nichols, has been affected.\n\nBut the model from which it reaped rewards could be replicated today legally by any small town in South Carolina.\n\nPut differently, any tiny place with highway traffic like Nichols could mine for gold.\n\nHELP: Support community journalism like this\n\nTown in decline\n\nFormer mayor Jimmy Little is one of the few residents who stayed behind after floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew nearly swept away the town. ANNA LEE/Staff\n\nNichols, like many of the other small towns dotting South Carolina\u2019s Pee Dee region, has been in decline for a long time. The town\u2019s population dropped from 525 in the 1990 census to 358 a generation later. Even more may flee after Hurricane Florence\u2019s floodwaters swept through the town again last autumn.\n\n\u201cWe used to have a thriving little town,\u201d said Jimmy Little, the former mayor. An auto mechanic by trade, he and his wife, Bonnie, have lived in Nichols for 50 years. She's a retired cafeteria worker.\n\nThey remember the little farming community in its heyday, when the tobacco exchanges were full and cotton and soybeans were widely planted. Once, Nichols had a drive-in theater, and its own elementary and high schools. There was a doctor\u2019s office and a dentist, too. \u201cIt was a very convenient place to live,\u201d Little said.\n\nJimmy and Bonnie were newlyweds when they bought their first home together \u2014 a house near the main town thoroughfare that they still live in today. They raised three sons, who later found good jobs at the public golf course.\n\nBut when the textile plants closed, business dried up. Retailers, seeking the more lucrative communities in Florence and Myrtle Beach, abandoned the region. Residents like the Littles hung on as Nichols spiraled downward.\n\nBy the time the town\u2019s police department began seizing money during traffic stops in 2014, Nichols\u2019 business district had dwindled to a grocery store, a pharmacy, a propane company, a beauty shop and an accounting firm. A handful of garages, the Sunny Mart and a Dollar General also remained, eking a living from traffic on U.S. 76 and State 9.\n\nFlooding damage from Hurricane Matthew ended all that, said Geraldine Ford, a retired teacher who owns Paul\u2019s Fish Market, the only restaurant left. The October 2016 storm dumped more than a foot of rain on the area, flushing the Lumber and Little Pee Dee rivers from their banks.\n\nNichols, at the center of the convergence, turned into a funnel for all that stormwater.\n\nThe level rose faster than Ford thought possible. When the flood came, \u201cthis place looked like a river \u2014 fish floating down the middle of the road,\u201d Ford said.\n\nShe talked about Hurricane Matthew in April 2018 from the counter of her restaurant. Behind her, a dry erase board listed the day\u2019s specials: smoked neck bone and rice, field peas, butter beans.\n\nMost of the town\u2019s 261 homes were destroyed or severely damaged in 2016. Its six churches and all 22 businesses, including Ford\u2019s, were flooded.\n\nFord was lucky \u2014 the fish market sits atop a hill, so the mildew wasn\u2019t as bad as it was in most places. By the time she reopened, most of her customers had gone. Their houses were ruined, and they didn\u2019t have the money to fix them.\n\nMore: Police can seize cash in the mail. An innocent man found out the hard way.\n\nMore: Exclusive: How civil forfeiture errors, delays enrich SC police, hurt people\n\nSeizing small amounts\n\nPart of Nichols\u2019 legacy might be the law enforcement example it was setting before the flood came.\n\nThe department, with three officers and a police chief, said it was keeping residents safer by discouraging drug activity through forfeiture and road stops. The overwhelming result for the town was a stream of cash that bolstered operating budgets for cops even as it consumed police time.\n\nBut what kind of citizens and drugs were targeted?\n\nDetails in court records are scant. The Nichols cases listed only names, dates and seizure amount, and many of the people police stopped didn\u2019t have criminal records that we could find.\n\nBrandon Hamer was one of them. Hamer lost nearly all his cash when a Nichols officer pulled over his friend in March 2014. The police report said Hamer was cited for simple possession of marijuana and \u201cvoluntarily forfeited $542.\u201d\n\nThe officer gave Hamer back $42 for reasons not specified in the report.\n\nThat same week, Joseph Burris lost $242 when he signed his cash over to police \u201cbecause of its connection to the purchase of marijuana.\u201d He, too, was cited for simple possession and driving left of center, according to the officer\u2019s report, though no record of the charges can be found in public records.\n\nIn all, Nichols\u2019 tiny police force made 50 seizures between 2014 and 2015, confiscating anywhere from $80 to $6,000 at a time. In all but three of those 50 cases, owners signed waivers agreeing to forfeit their money to the police department.\n\nMore: A 'historic event': Thanking TAKEN series, 71 SC legislators unveil bipartisan push to reform civil forfeiture\n\nIn doing so, they also gave up the right to fight the seizure in court to get all or even some of their cash back. So why would they consent?\n\nMaybe the answer is in the hassle for an out-of-towner. Ed Clements, the 12th Circuit solicitor, said citizens who signed consent agreements in Nichols were told they wouldn't have to \"come back and deal with it.\"\n\nAgencies in small towns across the country have paid for vehicles and equipment using the same methods. Nichols is no different, though it lacks the interstate highways often cited by authorities as the preferred method of transport for drug traffickers.\n\nClements said Nichols is unique in that it sits at the juncture of two highways on the way to a tourist destination. \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny little place with a lot of traffic going through it to the beach.\u201d\n\nThe numbers would be unusual in other towns, but here, \u201cit\u2019s not as odd as you might think,\u201d Clements said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to the beach, and they\u2019re going to party.\u201d\n\nThat fits in with Clement\u2019s description of who police were seizing money from. Most of the cases, he said, involved \u201cnormal pot smokers who \u2026 got caught at a traffic stop with drugs in their car.\u201d\n\nMore: Trail of targets shows breadth of lives changed by forfeiture\n\nMore: He fought off a robber, but police seized his $1,800\n\nCourt records from Nichols show only three people were ever arrested and convicted of a crime. Their cash was all seized by one officer: Sgt. Keith Massey.\n\nIn March 2015, Massey seized $1,749 from David Jones after finding some loose marijuana in an ashtray, along with the remnants of four blunts, a forfeiture filing said. The combined weight of the marijuana was 0.70 grams, which would easily fit inside a soda bottlecap. Court records show no charges for Jones, who was still fighting the claims in court three years later.\n\nA month later, Massey seized $1,984 from Joshua Grant, who was stopped for speeding. Massey said he smelled marijuana, which gave him probable cause to search Grant\u2019s vehicle. A small amount of drugs, 2.7 grams, was found in the car. Grant refused to sign over his money and was charged with minor possession of marijuana.\n\nMassey and the town\u2019s former police chief, Mark Lewis, didn\u2019t return messages seeking comment for this story.\n\nLewis left the department in 2018. Massey left at the end of 2015 to work for the Horry County Police Department, according to his employment records at the Criminal Justice Academy.\n\nBefore leaving his post, Massey was recognized at the annual National Interdiction Training Conference for the largest seizure of stolen credit cards made that year.\n\nThe seizure was made during a routine traffic stop, Massey said in an interview with The Morning News in Florence. As in his other cases, Massey said he smelled narcotics, which led to a vehicle search. Instead of cash, he found 173 cloned credit cards worth more than $500,000. The news article didn\u2019t name the driver or say whether any drugs were found.\n\nLewis told the newspaper he was thankful to have the resources needed to keep residents safe from drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cYes, we stop people from speeding, but we\u2019re not a speed trap,\u201d he said then. \u201cWe\u2019re a criminal enforcement unit, and our outlook is to try to reduce the amount of crime that \u2026 passes through our city.\u201d\n\nAfter the floods came and Massey left, the town\u2019s small police force turned its attention away from targeted traffic stops to rebuilding efforts.\n\n\u2014 Nathaniel Cary contributed reporting for this article.\n\n______\n\n______\n\nHave you lost property through civil forfeiture?

Police gave Martin 48 hours to transfer his firearms to a licensed gun owner or give them up to police.\n\nIf he saw the letter, he ignored it.\n\nHe would hardly have been alone.\n\nFewer than half of Illinois gun owners whose licenses are revoked follow through with the requirement to show authorities that they no longer own firearms, according to state police data.\n\nState police sent more than 10,800 revocation letters to Illinois residents last year. \u201cIn most instances,\u201d the agency said in a statement, the gun owners failed to vouch that they no longer possessed a firearm.\n\nCook County Sheriff Tom Dart launched a gun suppression team in 2013 that tracks down gun owners whose licenses have been revoked.\n\n\u201cThere are easily thousands and thousands of guns in people\u2019s houses right now who have had their rights revoked,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are trying to get your arms around the magnitude of this problem \u2013 good luck.

Ten days later, he applied for a concealed carry permit.\n\nHe chose to submit fingerprints, which cuts the maximum processing time for an application from 120 days to 90 days.\n\nPolice officers armed with rifles gather at the scene where an active shooter was reported in Aurora, Ill., Friday, Feb. 15, 2019. (Photo: Antonio Perez, AP)\n\nThe fingerprints helped surface his conviction in Mississippi, state police said. They sent Martin the letter informing him his license had been revoked.\n\nThe agency was supposed to notify police in Aurora, where Martin lived, of the revocation.\n\nKane County State\u2019s Attorney Joseph McMahon told reporters Tuesday that his office was conducting an investigation of the shooting. The probe, he said, would include a review of where the revocation notices were sent by Illinois State Police.\n\nSgt. Bill Rowley, an Aurora police spokesman, said Tuesday that Aurora police have not found any record of receiving a revocation notice about Martin from State Police. He noted that State Police have also yet to find record of sending a notice to Aurora police.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t receive one, we just don\u2019t have any record of that,\u201d Rowley said.\n\nIf police had known that Martin failed to comply with the revocation letter, they could have petitioned a county judge to issue a search warrant and attempted to retrieve the weapon.\n\nState law doesn\u2019t require departments to seek warrants in such circumstances.\n\n\u201cThis is primarily a resourcing problem,\u201d said Kyleanne Hunter, vice president of programs at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cUnfortunately, we see this too often with things to do with enforcement of firearms law. In Illinois, they have a process, but they don\u2019t have the resources to implement it.\u201d\n\nIllinois lawmakers attempted to bolster regulations that ensure that gun owners whose licenses are revoked comply with laws.\n\nState Rep.

Nick Oza/azcentral.com\n\nThe family of a man shot in a barrage of bullets fired by Sacramento police has filed a $20 million federal lawsuit, claiming officers racially profiled the victim in a case that's drawn national interest in the ongoing debate about excessive force.\n\nLawyers for the family of Stephon Clark say the officers failed to identify themselves as police before they abruptly began firing at Clark in his grandparents' backyard on March 18. Officers suggested in a preliminary investigation that they thought Clark had a gun, but he was only carrying a cellphone when he died.\n\n\"The involved officers . . . fired 20 shots striking (Clark) approximately eight times,\" according to the lawsuit, filed this week in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.\n\n\"The conduct of officers Terrence Mercadal and Jared Robinet was willful, wanton, malicious, and done with reckless disregard for the rights and safety\" of Clark, the lawsuit alleges.

The amount sought in the claims is more than a third of the size of the city\u2019s $37 million parks budget.\n\nBut often, amounts initially sought in lawsuits are whittled down during legal negotiations and court proceedings.\n\nProtests and peaceful rallies in Sacramento disrupted traffic, blocked access to NBA basketball games and interrupted a local city council meeting after Clark was shot. His death reignited the familiar frustration and anger after similar police shootings of black unarmed men.\n\nOne of the officers was black and the other was white; both were later placed on paid administrative leave, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe lawsuit filed this week alleges that Clark's family has greatly suffered throughout the ordeal.\n\nClark \"suffered extreme mental and physical pain and suffering and eventually suffered a loss of life and earning capacity,\" the lawsuit says. \"Plaintiffs have also been deprived of the life-long love, companionship, comfort, support, society, care, and sustenance of (Clark,) and will continue to be so deprived for the remainder of their natural lives.\"\n\nPolice had initially gone to Clark's grandparents' neighborhood to investigate a complaint about someone breaking car windows.

And it plays out in civil proceedings where citizens aren\u2019t provided an attorney or given the right to a speedy trial.\n\nIt's something Tonja Flythe-Harkless now knows well.\n\nWhen Greenville sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested her son David Green on drug trafficking charges in July 2017, they knew the truck he was driving belonged to his mother in Maryland. A deputy said in the incident report that her name was listed on the title as the registered owner.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop police from seizing the vehicle.\n\nAnd when it came time to notify any interested parties in the forfeiture action, it's not clear the authorities tried to contact Flythe-Harkless. That\u2019s despite her call to the Sheriff\u2019s Office the day after her son\u2019s arrest, or the two letters her son David wrote from jail telling authorities the truck belonged to his mom.\n\nIn December 2017, four months after the case was filed, prosecutors asked a judge to forfeit the 2006 Ford F-350 by default because no one had come forward to dispute the case. The judge denied the request. She had gone through the file and seen David's letters. She told prosecutors to set a hearing.\n\nStill, no one sent Flythe-Harkless a summons until a Greenville News reporter met with 13th Circuit Solicitor Walt Wilkins on April 4 and asked about the case. The court summons was finally mailed to Flythe-Harkless the next day.\n\nHer story is not rare.\n\nThe TAKEN investigation identified hundreds of instances where property owners never received notice of forfeiture cases \u2014 sometimes because serious errors were made by the prosecutors tracking them down.\n\nIn one Simpsonville case, the Solicitor\u2019s Office sent a woman's summons to the wrong city.\n\nAnother time, in Georgetown, authorities said they couldn\u2019t locate a man, who turned out to be incarcerated. State law requires agencies to check the prison system when they're notifying owners of a case.\n\nIn a Greenville case, an assistant solicitor said a company named as a defendant in a case couldn\u2019t be found. A reporter reached the company after a Google search.\n\nNotification errors we discovered pointed to a larger pattern uncovered after months of interviews and research: a lax system of oversight in South Carolina. We found fear among owners of confronting the police and numerous mistakes among law enforcement that compound the barriers to regaining property.\n\nThe result is that forfeiture overwhelmingly ends in the government\u2019s favor.\n\nMore than 70 percent of forfeiture cases filed against individual property owners from 2014-2016 were won by default, the TAKEN investigation found.\n\nThat means the police never had to persuade a judge or jury about the merits of a claim.\n\nTHESE PROJECTS TAKE TIME & MONEY.

The system barely resembles the one used in the 1980s to take profits from drug kingpins and money launderers during the War on Drugs.\n\nInstead of circling a few high-dollar cases, law enforcement agencies now target low-level offenders and seize the money they carry. A third of cash forfeitures in the state during our three-year research period, about 1,500, involved $500 or less in cash. This includes 645 people alone in Florence County and 288 people in Richland County.\n\nSometimes police seized $18 or $27 or $40.\n\nThat's a money- and time-wasting amount, say people familiar with the system. It costs prosecutors $150 to file a case, $25 to file a motion and still more to serve papers on property owners.\n\nIn some cases, there\u2019s no war on drugs involved at all, because there is no crime. Because forfeiture proceedings address the property itself \u2014 claiming it was involved in suspicious activity, property owners aren't part of the case, except usually being named an interested party.\n\nNearly one-fifth of people who had their assets seized in South Carolina weren't charged with a related crime. Roughly the same number \u2014 nearly 800 people in three years \u2014 were charged but not convicted.\n\nMore: How we brought TAKEN to life\n\nMore: 5 things we learned from TAKEN's civil forfeiture investigation\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t need winning proof to seize and keep cash, cars or other valuables. To win forfeiture in South Carolina, it just has to show that property is more likely than not connected to crime.\n\nAt times that means authorities try to seize homes just to discourage crime in the neighborhood. At least twice in recent years, agencies tried to seize widows' homes because they said the women didn\u2019t do enough to stop drug sales taking place beyond their front stoop.\n\nRozina Javis, who is in her 80s, has lived in the same brick home near Columbia's Williams-Brice Stadium since 1964.\n\nShe's sheltered generations of her family under her roof, but she nearly lost her home when police said she failed to keep criminals off her lawn.\n\nColumbia resident Rozina Javis kept her home despite attempts by authorities to seize it due to criminal activity nearby. MIKE ELLIS/Staff\n\nDavid Wilson, then the Richland County sheriff\u2019s chief deputy, wrote a letter to Javis, saying excessive criminal activity had occurred at her address. He cited 23 offenses over an eight-year period, including vandalism and murder. \"Any further incidents involving illegal drugs/weapons at this property location will result in the immediate seizure of this property under State and Federal Forfeiture Laws,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nJavis called Wilson and told him she was aware of illegal activities. She said she was able to stop it during the daytime but not after she went to bed at 9 p.m.\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department tried to seize the house, so she hired an attorney and successfully fought the forfeiture.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bully approach,\" said Javis\u2019 attorney, Byron Gipson. \"You can harass or threaten. Why don\u2019t you go fix the real problem?\"\n\nUnlike Javis, most people don't fight.\n\nHundreds each year \u2014 who aren't facing serious criminal charges \u2014 just choose to let their money or property go. The reasons are myriad but revolve around a common theme: powerlessness in the face of law enforcement and prosecutors.\n\nMore: 65% of cash seized by SC police comes from black men. Experts blame racism.\n\nMore: Isiah Kinloch grapples with aftermath of civil forfeiture\n\nDeck stacked for police\n\nTime and again, Greenville defense attorney Jake Erwin watches the same process play out: Clients will contact him because the police have taken their money, car or their TV set. They\u2019re mad or confused. They claim they\u2019re innocent, or they weren\u2019t charged.\n\nSomeone has shown up at their door to deliver a summons and complaint. On the first page, it says they have 30 days to file an answer with the clerk of court. The clock starts. They have no idea what to do. Some do nothing.\n\nFrom the very beginning of a forfeiture proceeding, the deck is stacked in favor of police, according to numerous defense attorneys across the state who spoke to The News over the course of several months.\n\nThey talked about a civil process they believe unfairly strains an inalienable right granted in the Fifth Amendment: that property cannot be taken without due process.\n\nThe venue where the forfeiture argument plays out offers the first challenge, the attorneys said. The entire matter, once it leaves the roadside or police encounter, is handled in civil court. This legal path is different from the course of almost every other action police take.\u201cIf the individual ... is poor, if they\u2019re indigent ... you don\u2019t get a lawyer appointed from the public defender\u2019s office,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own.\u201d\n\nIf they're unable to pay for an attorney, citizens sometimes can convince one to take the case for a cut if the money is returned, Erwin said. That guarantees owners will never get all their money back because, at a minimum, they will owe the lawyer part of it.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Greenville resident Ryan Hamer when police seized $6,000 in money orders he was trying to mail to a friend in need on the West Coast. Hamer wasn\u2019t charged with any crime. He could prove the money was his, and the Greenville Police Department returned it within six weeks. Still, he had to pay $1,200 for legal help.\n\nHamer initially thought about letting police have his money \u2014 thousands of dollars they had no right to keep. \u201cI almost went that route just because I didn\u2019t want to cause myself any problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI was worried about harassment.\u201d\n\nTAKEN from the mail: Ryan Hamer's money goes missing He sent money to a friend in need. But it never got there. Lauren Petracca, The Greenville News\n\nFiguring out the system on their own\n\nSince police increasingly target lower-level offenders for civil forfeiture, they often seize smaller amounts of money: a few hundred dollars from a wallet, tips from pizza deliveries, a gift from a grandparent to buy a car or money from a recently cashed paycheck.\n\nIf they don\u2019t have enough money to hire an attorney, some people try to navigate the legal process themselves.\n\nIn a four-page handwritten answer filed in July 2016, Bryant Bennett represented himself, laying out the reasons he believed his money should be returned. Among them, the Charleston man said the $560 was money from his disability check and not tied to drugs. He wrote in the filing's closing: I \"ask this honorable court to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint for Forfeiture, and issue an order for the Plaintiff to return the said U.S. currency to defendant. IT IS EVER SO PRAYED!!!\u201d\n\nIn another case, the defendant wrote his answer by hand from prison.\n\nNeither man\u2019s attempt to get money returned was successful.\n\nKeith Diggs, an attorney with the legal group Institute for Justice, which represents clients and advocates for civil forfeiture reform, said counties or states typically use a prosecutor who\u2019s skilled in forfeiture. When pitted against a person filing pro se to represent themselves, \u201cIt\u2019s rare that they have their claims taken seriously.\u201d\n\nIn numerous South Carolina cases, a property owner would file an initial response in time but then miss a hearing or fail to provide an updated address if moving. Sometimes the government would send notices to the wrong address or cancel hearings at the last minute. If the owner misses a court date, the government prevails, but if the owner shows up, the government often postpones, Diggs said.\n\n\u201cCivil forfeiture subjects the property owner to an incredible maze of laws that is difficult to navigate without an attorney,\u201d he said.\n\nMonths or years waiting for government\u2019s move\n\nThe state\u2019s forfeiture statute says the government must file motions to forfeit property within a \u201creasonable amount of time.\u201d\n\nState law sets that time as two years.\n\nThe TAKEN analysis found more than 100 examples in which prosecutors seemingly flouted that law, sometimes holding cases for years beyond the mandatory deadline for action.\n\nSometimes, the delays are from police departments cleaning out evidence rooms after years failing to keep pace. Other times, it\u2019s law enforcement officers filing to keep assets they deem \u201cabandoned.\u201d\n\nBut many other times, it\u2019s simply a failure to pursue forfeiture in the two-year time frame. If no one disputes the case, authorities still get to keep the assets rather than sending them to a clearinghouse like the Office of the State Treasurer, which maintains unclaimed property.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have no legal leg to stand on once their delayed cases are contested, said Lawrence Crane, a defense attorney who\u2019s successfully fought against forfeiture on those grounds. \u201cBasically, they\u2019re taking the money that they\u2019re not entitled to anyway,\u201d Crane said.\n\nIn some ways, it\u2019s a hidden trigger, a get-your-assets-back card that most people are unaware exists.\n\nGraphic: Karl Gelles/USA TODAY\n\nChristopher Lewis, a Simpsonville man whose money was seized by the Greenville Police Department in 2010 over a simple drug possession charge, was one of the few who did take advantage of this hidden trigger when he found out years later that the state hadn\u2019t filed in time to keep his money.\n\nWhen Lewis was finally served notice of his case in 2016, he did the one thing he needed to do in order to get his money returned: he responded.\n\n\u201cI was unaware that it was possible to have the money returned to me,\u201d he wrote, saying the money seized was a combination of tip money and his paycheck from delivering pizzas.\n\nSix years after his money was taken, he received a check for $427.\n\nBut his example is rare.\n\n\u201cThey get away with it a lot,\u201d Crane said, because most of the time property owners don\u2019t fight back.\n\nEven when the state works within the timeline allowed, critics say there\u2019s no reason why most cases need to languish for months before they\u2019re filed.\n\nPetition cases \u2014 where prosecutors request, or petition, to forfeit property \u2014 take an average of 17 months to resolve from the date assets are seized, an analysis by The Greenville News shows. In many of those cases, the money or property has been in police custody for more than a year.\n\nSpartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright, a leading proponent of forfeiture in the state, said the delays are because the cases aren\u2019t as serious as others on the solicitor\u2019s docket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll sit there sometimes for a year because (the solicitor) has a lot of cases he has to deal with,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say, \u2018Please put these in front of the murders.\u2019\u201d\n\n______\n\nAs the TAKEN project team dug even more deeply into the forfeiture court process in South Carolina, we eventually uncovered cases that weren't cases. Legal seizure but no standard paper trail in a court of law. Read about it in \"Forfeiture proceedings hidden,\" below.\n\nForfeiture proceedings hidden, never filed\n\nAt least two judicial circuits in South Carolina have for years used an uncommon practice hidden from public scrutiny to process and record certain police seizures totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nEven more circuits may be doing the same.\n\nIf you want to find out how often York County law enforcement seized money from citizens with their \u201cconsent,\u201d you can\u2019t. There are no cases on file.\n\nEven within a troubled and under-scrutinized civil asset forfeiture system, this effort to collect money outside the public view is an irregular practice in South Carolina. It was uncovered during the TAKEN project by The Greenville News.\n\nLegally, these cash grabs may not have to be filed in court, though most prosecutors do file them for transparency. The money was \u201cgiven\u201d to police by owners who signed waivers saying they wouldn't fight to get their property back.\n\nCitizens give up their rights to their cash or property all the time. It happens for a few reasons: they\u2019re scared, and they think they\u2019ve done something illegal. They don\u2019t want the hassle of fighting it in court. They think the forfeiture will help their criminal case or get their sentence reduced.\n\nConsent is generally a simple process; usually a single document disclaiming ownership of the property. It\u2019s signed by the owner on the side of the road, or sometimes later by the owner's attorney, and by the prosecutor and the officer. At some point the paperwork is filed with the circuit court and signed off by a judge.\n\nBut in at least two circuits \u2014 the 10th Judicial Circuit in Anderson and Oconee counties and the 16th Judicial Circuit, which includes York and Union counties \u2014 solicitors never file the consent forfeiture.\n\nInstead, in the 16th Circuit, officers convince a person to sign a pre-written document, which is taken to the solicitor and to a judge for approval. Once it\u2019s approved, the Solicitor's Office just holds onto the document.\n\nMore: Marchant Johnson's dog profits\n\nShow caption Hide caption Forfeiture proceedings aren't assigned case numbers or even filed in the state's court system in some jurisdictions, the TAKEN investigation has found. Here, cases are... Forfeiture proceedings aren't assigned case numbers or even filed in the state's court system in some jurisdictions, the TAKEN investigation has found. Here, cases are simply stored in an out-of-the-way file cabinet at the Anderson County Courthouse. MIKE ELLIS/Staff\n\nDavid Wagner, the solicitor in Anderson and Oconee counties, said his office has a similar system. In Oconee, the consent cases are kept at the solicitor\u2019s office. In Anderson, they're stored in a file cabinet at the courthouse. And they stay there.\n\nThe forfeiture proceedings aren't assigned case numbers, and they're never filed as a public record where anyone can view them, the TAKEN investigation has found.\n\nThe practice isn\u2019t transparent, said S.C. Press Association director Bill Rogers, after being made aware of what was going on. Having access to these records is vital for the public to track how public agencies operate, he said.\n\nIf the public can\u2019t readily access this information, taxpayers are unable to see how often police seize assets from people, who those people are or how much is being seized. Filing cases at the courthouse would provide a check on police so they don\u2019t abuse their civil forfeiture power and seize money for the purpose of bulking up their budgets.\n\nIt's probably legal. A spokesman for the state Attorney General\u2019s Office said the consent form is likely all that\u2019s required under current state law.\n\nThe forms are still public records and could be examined by visiting a solicitor\u2019s office and searching through filing cabinets to locate and organize hundreds of forms: a daunting task.\n\nAsked how difficult it would be to fulfill a public records request for all 2014-2016 consent cases, a prosecutor said it would be extremely time-consuming and cumbersome to locate the paper records.\n\nStephanie Looper, an assistant solicitor over asset forfeiture in Anderson and Oconee, said \u2014 following the TAKEN investigative reporting effort \u2014 that prosecutors will start filing consent waivers in court to be more transparent.\n\nWhen forfeiture cases aren\u2019t filed, the public record doesn\u2019t reflect the actual amount of money seized by law enforcement. Between 2014-2016, court records show South Carolina police seized more than $17 million from citizens using the state\u2019s civil forfeiture law. It\u2019s likely millions more than is recorded.\n\nFor example, court records examined by The Greenville News show the York County Multijurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit seized $135,000 in cash from 133 people over the TAKEN three-year study period. Of that, $119,000, or 88 percent, was forfeited to law enforcement. The rest was returned.\n\nSC police seize millions through civil forfeiture: TAKEN Many of the people in SC who lose cash, property through forfeiture are never arrested or convicted of wrongdoing, our investigative project found. Josh Morgan, The Greenville News\n\nYork DEU Commander Marvin Brown said the amount forfeited was actually closer to $800,000 because 85-90 percent of their forfeiture cases never go in the court system.\n\nThe only time York DEU cases are filed is when owners contest and fight to get their money back in court, Brown said.\n\nLeslie Robinson, an assistant solicitor in York County, said prosecutors tried filing consent cases a few years ago, but the York County Clerk of Court's office sent them back.\n\nWagner, the solicitor in Anderson County, said he didn\u2019t know of a way to track how much cash or property has been forfeited to law enforcement over the years, other than meticulously searching each record by hand.\n\nMore: Trail of targets shows breadth of lives changed by forfeiture\n\nRobert Bruce, a York defense attorney, knows these consent forms well \u2014 he\u2019s had clients who signed them \u2014 and he has one big concern: that people who have no connection to drugs are being coerced into waiving their property rights.\n\n\u201cIf someone had property from legal means, truly no connection to drugs ... they sign this under the stress of being arrested and they don\u2019t process what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Bruce said.\n\nIt becomes exponentially more difficult for people to get their money back once they sign away their consent, he said. \u201cAt that point, there\u2019s not a lot I can do,\u201d he said.\n\nThere may be even more forfeiture cases tucked away from public scrutiny in other parts of the state. No consent cases were recorded in the Fourth Circuit, which covers Chesterfield, Marlboro, Darlington and Dillon counties, or the 15th Circuit, which covers Horry and Georgetown counties.\n\nFourth Circuit Solicitor Will Rogers said his offices rarely pursue forfeiture cases and prefer to hand them over to the federal government, which splits profits with local agencies.\n\nAn Horry County employee said they don't file consent cases and instead store them at the solicitor's office. She didn\u2019t know how many cases they\u2019d processed like that.\n\nFour other counties \u2014 Edgefield, Saluda, Fairfield and Williamsburg \u2014 had no forfeiture cases on file at all.\n\n______\n\n______\n\nHave you lost property through civil forfeiture?

He was twice terminated from the department, including once in 2011 for a domestic violence arrest where the charges were later dropped. The arrest was later expunged from his record, according to an expungement order.

The video surfaced barely two months ago.\n\nIn fact, when the video surfaced in December, the NFL placed the Kansas City Chiefs star on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list. Shortly after, the Chiefs released him.\n\nArmour: Banishing Kareem Hunt forever doesn't do him, anyone else, any good\n\nBest chance: Why AAF could be Kaepernick's million-dollar opportunity\n\nHunt was never arrested for the incident, which is puzzling if you\u2019ve seen the video. Yet that is beside the point. The evidence of violence is there. Enough for Kansas City to move on.\n\nThe league is still investigating what happened last February in that Cleveland hotel. And it\u2019s likely that when the investigation concludes, Hunt will be penalized. This could include a suspension.\n\nThe Browns are aware of that. They said so in the statement:\n\n\u201cWe fully understand and respect the complexity of questions and issues in signing a player with Kareem\u2019s history and do not condone his actions. Given what we know about Kareem through our extensive research, we believe he deserves a second chance but certainly with the understanding that he has to go through critical and essential steps to become a performing member of this organization, aside from what the NFL determines from their ongoing investigation.\n\n\u201cWe fully understand that Kareem is subject to discipline by the NFL.

His speed. His big-play talent. And how he might fit with the Browns' promising young pieces on offense, including budding star quarterback, Baker Mayfield.\n\nIf you think the real reason is anything other than this, you don\u2019t pay attention to the NFL.\n\nObviously, the NFL gave its blessing to the signing, or it wouldn\u2019t have happened.

Many of whom, I suspect, will not turn off Browns games next fall.\n\nOr plan boycotts. Or cheer the President if he were to weigh in on Hunt\u2019s signing, which I assume he will not.\n\nDorsey said the Browns \"fully understand and respect the complexity of questions and issues in signing a player with Kareem's history.\u201d\n\nAnd in reading those words, it\u2019s not hard to imagine a general manager making a similar plea regarding Kaepernick.\n\nThe NFL is giving Hunt another chance because they know they can sell it.

He declined and questioned why he needed to identify himself.\n\nGlendale police, in a statement released Friday, said Wheatcroft also was reaching under the seat for a backpack and officers asked him to stop.\n\nJohnny Wheatcroft (Photo: Arizona Department of Corrections)\n\nOfficers eventually threatened to use a Taser if Wheatcroft did not exit the vehicle, the video shows.\n\nFrom there, the situation escalated, with police pulling him from the vehicle while his seat belt still was latched.\n\nIn the video, Wheatcroft can be heard saying, \"I'm not doing nothing,'' repeatedly. As he is partway out of the vehicle, police begin using the Tasers, doing so repeatedly as the man is pulled from the vehicle and then onto the ground as his children can be heard screaming in the background.\n\nThe newly released police body-camera footage was provided to The Arizona Republic on Friday by an attorney for the couple.\n\nPolice use of Tasers: Why and when do police use the shocking devices?\n\nMore: Police are looking for alternatives to guns.

It contends Wheatcroft and his family suffered from trauma and physical and emotional damages.\n\nGlendale police, in Friday's statement, said after the traffic stop, the officer discovered the driver, who was the family friend, did not have a license and observed a seat-belt violation in the vehicle as well.\n\nGlendale police use a Taser on a suspect in an image from 2017 body-cam footage released by the Glendale Police Department.

A lawsuit alleges excessive force by police. Glendale Police Department\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Arizona by attorneys Marc Victor and Jody Broudas, alleges that the officers used \"unlawful, unnecessary, unreasonable, and excessive force, which resulted in life-altering injuries to Plaintiff Johnny Wheatcroft and his family.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that officers Tased Wheatcroft multiple times in the back and in the chest while on the hot asphalt. A technique known as a \"drive stun'' in which the Taser, normally fired from a distance, is pressed against a person, also was used, both police and the lawsuit say.\n\nAfter Wheatcroft was handcuffed, Officer Schneider continued to use the Taser several times, the lawsuit says.\n\nAnother officer then \"slammed Wheatcroft face down onto the asphalt while Schneider continued to Tase him, while also kicking him in the groin,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nThe final Tasing occurred when Officer Schneider \"pulled down Plaintiff\u2019s shorts and Tased his testicles and perineum,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nAs a group of officers began removing the Taser prongs, \"Schneider placed his Taser on Johnny Wheatcroft\u2019s penis and screamed, 'Keep fighting and you\u2019re going to get it again! You want it again? Shut your mouth!' the lawsuit contends.\n\nPolice, in the statement, said Wheatcroft eventually calmed down and both he and Chapman were arrested.\n\nMore: Arizona police shot and killed 14-year-old boy carrying an airsoft gun\n\nMore: Arizona police release body camera video of officers punching unarmed man\n\nThey both initially were charged with aggravated assault and physically resisting arrest. The charges against Wheatcroft eventually were dismissed. Chapman pleaded guilty to a reduced count, according to Maricopa County Superior Court records.\n\nThe lawsuit names the city of Glendale, Schneider, Lindsey and a third officer, MIchael Fernandez, as defendants. The suit does not specify a damage amount being sought.\n\nGlendale police said that after the incident, Schneider was suspended for three days.\n\n\"The drive stun with the Taser device administered by the officer after the suspect was handcuffed and no longer resisting did not fall within our response to resistance policy,'' said Officer Tiffany Ngalula, a Police Department spokeswoman.\n\nLindsey, who was struck by the bottles, was treated at a hospital and returned to duty several days later, police said.\n\nAfter the couple had been taken to jail, officers found \"a usable quantity of methamphetamine\" inside the vehicle, according to the Police Department news release.

Don't recall any punches being thrown at those, though. Because it takes a bully at the top to enable their bully followers.\n\n\u2014 Abe Ellenberg\n\nI find it ironic that Trump calls himself a \"disruptor,\" yet doesn't like it when he meets ANY disruptive opposition. I do NOT condone violence, nor do I consider that free speech. But I do note that in any case of anyone disagreeing with Trump, he calls \"foul.\" As in, \"how dare anyone disagree with me.\" What he is missing is just how divisive and inciteful his commentary is. As usual, he accepts zero responsibility for his words. When he says he would like to choke out a protester, what do you think that says to his \"supporters?\" It says, \"whatever I want to do, I will, and you all back me, right?\"\n\n\u2014 Michael Anthony Shea\n\nI'm not a Trump fan by any means, but I'm sorry free speech is a right, hard fought for and won. You don't have to buy into the message if you don't want. But you should be able to listen to it. Kinda ticked me off when college kids admitted to planning the interruption.

In it, three generations of an African-American family watch TV and wait to hear whether a police officer who Tasered a black, unarmed man dozens of times would be indicted. The discussions mirror those that families across the country must have had in the wake of the grand jury decisions in 2014 over the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York.\n\nTV parents Rainbow and Dre Johnson struggle with whether they should shield their youngest children from the racism that exists within the justice system and let them know that the system is often rigged against minorities.\n\nThe youngest boy wonders whether he could be Tasered. Rainbow tries to reassure him, saying he would be fine if he follows officers\u2019 orders. His grandmother also chimes in saying there are only seven words to know when stopped by police: \u201cYes, sir. No, sir. And thank you, sir.\u201d Dre (with help from his father) knocks down that reassurance citing the cases of Freddie Gray and Sandra Bland, both of whom died in police custody.\n\nIn the process, the episode prompted real folks to have conversations that reflected the deep ones tackled on screen. A former police officer says while police brutality happens, it\u2019s not as widespread as the public may be led to believe. Readers on Facebook talked about whose responsibility it is to end it and how to tackle racism head-on.\n\nRead their comments below, then share your views.\n\nComment from Facebook edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nThis was a great episode of Black-ish. It was truthful and profound. I\u2019m not a fan of the show, but this one resonated with me and my husband. This episode spoke volumes! We aren\u2019t anti-police, but the racism that continues in this country has to stop, and it\u2019s up to the public to speak out any way we can to say, \u201cStop!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kathy Paxton\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nIn the recent USA TODAY article about the show Black-ish and the episode on police brutality, Anthony Anderson, who plays father Andre \u201cDre\u201d Johnson, states he was a victim of police brutality when he was a teenager. We have no further insight into these incidents (\u201c\u2018Black-ish\u2019 confronts police brutality in new episode\u201c).\n\nAs a retired police officer with 33 years on the street, I can acknowledge that incidents of overreaction and police brutality do occur, and there are people who do not belong in police work. But they are the exception, not the norm.\n\nFrom a police officer\u2019s view, when a subject fails to acknowledge your authority, you are forced to take a hands-on approach. It\u2019s usually swift and sometimes violent, but that doesn\u2019t make it police brutality. Rule of thumb: as resistance stops, use of force diminishes.\n\nWhite, black, yellow or brown, the best way to avoid a confrontation is to comply with the officer until the situation gets sorted out and adrenaline subsides. It\u2019s called, \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\n\nKarl Grill; Alexandria, Va.\n\nComments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nThe beauty of today\u2019s police is that they are equal opportunity. They beat blacks, browns, Asians and whites. They are no longer your friends. Black parents are not the only ones who have to explain the senseless brutality that some police departments seem to enjoy dishing out.\n\n\u2014 Rosa Washington\n\nDon\u2019t break the law, and you won\u2019t get shot. Period.\n\n\u2014 Jennie Cooper Franklin\n\nI was deeply moved watching this episode. It was truthful. I am white and have lived through years of supporting, educating and working with individuals from diverse backgrounds as a teacher and a psychologist. We have to work together to keep hope alive. When one of us suffers, all of us suffer. This episode speaks to all of us to stop all racism, and to raise all of us so we can all feel hopeful and have real opportunities. I want to thank the creators, producers and the cast of Black-ish who have told it like it is.

Well, your smart TV is watching you and making extra money, too\n\nCLOSE The prices of Smart TVs have plummeted, as set makers have figured out a different way to make money off you. USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham reports for Talking Tech. USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Your smart TV is watching you. And making money off you as well.\n\nThat\u2019s why the prices of TVs have fallen so dramatically over the last five years.\n\nA mix of lower LCD prices, more intense competition and new ways to profit off the consumer once the set enters our homes have turned the boob tube into something more like a razor. And we, the viewers, are the razor blades.\n\nBill Baxter, the Chief Technology Officer for TV set giant Vizio, referred to it as the \"post-purchase monetization\" of the TV on a recent podcast interview with the Verge.\n\nTranslated, that means that more ads are coming at you via prominent branded movie and TV channels on smart TVs. These channels share ad revenues with set manufacturers like Vizio, Samsung, LG, an avenue that didn't exist in the pre-streaming era. They also profit by selling data of your viewing histories to programmers and marketers.\n\nThe manufacturers have been tracking viewers on smart TVs for several years, but it wasn't until 2017 and beyond that more consumers started buying smart sets, which negate the need for a streaming device like a Roku or Fire Stick to bring in online entertainment from the likes of Netflix and Hulu.\n\nToday, virtually all TVs sold are smart TVs, says Steve Koenig of the Consumer Technology Association.\n\nSo what's new, and helping manufacturers make money off us once the TV enters our home, is the rise of ad-supported streaming channels that share ad revenues with the likes of Vizio, Samsung and LG, and get prominent positions on the smart TV dial.\n\nIn the menu settings, you can turn data monitoring off on TCL Roku branded TVs (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\n\u2013 On Vizio TVs, the \"Watch Free TV,\" channel on its smart TV sets is actually the same Pluto TV channel seen on streaming players, computers and mobile devices.\n\n\u2013 Rival Xumo has a similar arrangement, called Channel Plus on LG sets.\n\n\u2013 Tubi is on Samsung TVs and Xumo on Panasonic, Sanyo and Sharp sets.\n\n\u2013 Streaming player maker Roku has its own arrangement with TCL, which sells Roku branded sets, where it offers the Roku Channel.\n\nThe Roku Channel offers ad-supported movies and TV shows on TCL and other brand TVs (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nThe Roku channel is similar to Xumo, Tubi and Pluto in offering ad-supported older movies and TV shows, for free, as an alternative to all those internet streaming channels that charge a monthly subscription.\n\nBeing on smart TVs is \"great for us,\" says Pluto CEO Tom Ryan. \"The hardware companies, in their quest for higher margins, are looking to content and services to get more revenue. We've got it.\"\n\nFree movies: How to see thousands of streaming movies and TV shows for free\n\nFinding deals: The best 4K TVs under $1,000 are at their lowest price\u2014for now\n\nFree TV: Here's how you can view free streaming TV\n\nTVs have historically been a cutthroat, low-margin business, hence all those Black Friday deals of large-screen sets going out the door for $300 to $400. We found a 43-inch TCL Smart TV with 4K resolution at Target this month for $250.\n\nThe wholesale price for an average 50-inch set has fallen to $335, from $589 in 2013, according to the CTA.\n\nThe home screen of the Amazon branded Fire TV Edition TVs. Notice a certain shopping channel atop the lineup, followed by another Amazon shopping channel? (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nOnce \"smart TVs\" began to become popular, manufacturers saw a new opportunity in treating the set as a \"glass window\" to our viewing habits and reporting them to marketers for a fee, in a process called Automatic Content Recognition or ACR.\n\nIn 2017, Vizio settled with the Federal Trade Commission and New Jersey's attorney general office for $2.2 million, when it was charged with collecting data without the consent of users.\n\nNow, Vizio, which continues to collect data, has users opt-in. \"Unless you turn off ACR collection in the Settings menu, we may share viewing data with data partners, including analytics companies, media companies and advertisers,\" Vizio tells viewers in the settings menu.\n\nAmazon's data collecting opt-in on its Fire TV Edition branded TVs (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nThe manufacturers say what they're doing is no different from what Nielsen has done for years. They monitor your viewing to determine the hits and they say they do it anonymously. (Of course, with Nielsen, the process of signing up and participating is a great deal more obvious and visible.)\n\nAs Inscape Data Services, the wholly-owned subsidiary of TV set manufacturer Vizio says on its website that it collects data without \"personally identifiable information (PII),\" to identify \"what show is being watched and what IP address the device is connected to.\"\n\nJustin Brookman, the director of privacy and tech policy for nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Consumer Reports, doesn't buy it.\n\n\"There's no such thing as anonymous tracking,\" he says. \"They have ways...to tie them to your TV.\"\n\nIf \"I Spy TV\" sounds creepy, well, how about those other tech devices in your home?\n\n\"This pales in comparison,\" says Jodie McAfee, a senior vice-president of Inscape, which collects data from over 10 million Vizio smart TVs. \"What a TV is generating on data is not nearly as granular. It just knows what shows I\u2019m watching and whether the ad is being viewed.\"\n\nCompare that to a smartphone, which tracks your every move in the house, both physically and on the device. It knows what websites you've been to, who you called and texted with, what products you purchased, and if you turned on Facebook or signed into Google, your age, demographic, salary and more.\n\nUnlike other devices, smart TVs haven't been affected by the Trump administration's trade war with China, where most of the sets are made, says Steve Koenig of the CTA.\n\n\"Car audio has been hit, but smart home products haven't been,\" he says. \"We believe tariffs are a tax on products, and don\u2019t want to see them in any form.\"\n\nMeanwhile, back in the living room, McAfee insists that ACR tracking can help consumers by finding better recommendations. \"It improves the viewing experience,\" he says.\n\nAnd if you don't want your viewing tracked, viewers can go to the menu settings and turn off ACR (which is supposed to be off by default anyway.) Or, they can go a few steps further and turn the Wi-Fi off on the set altogether.\n\nHave questions about smart TVs? We're here to help. Ask away on Twitter, where I'm @jeffersongraham.

Rather than bidding on rental cars and finding out later if they have a reservation, travelers will now know their price ahead of booking and will immediately get that booking confirmed.\n\nPriceline already suspended NYOP option for airlines in 2016.\n\nAs of this morning, travelers will only be able to name their own price on hotel rooms.\n\nPriceline\u2019s Express Deals will offer the same deals for rental cars, including some that will provide up to 40% of savings, says Bill Jose, senior vice president of rental cars at Priceline.com.\n\nThe new process, he says, will be easier and faster.\n\n\u201cWith rental cars, we have seen the consumers prefer Express Deals, and as a result we chose to make this switch,\u201d he says. \u201cThe main benefit to consumers with this switch to Express Deals is with speed. Name Your Own Price for rental cars required consumers to bid and wait. With Express Deals, those steps are eliminated.\u201d\n\nWebsites such as Priceline and Hotwire did well with the NYOP model for a while. But hotel companies have pushed back in recent years, offering incentives to travelers who book directly with their websites.\n\nFor instance, those who book with OTAs generally don\u2019t get loyalty program points. And hotels argue that they can deal better with changes to reservations and problems on the ground when they have direct bookings.\n\nThat said, hotels also benefit from unloading unused inventory on sites such as Priceline and mobile apps such as Hotel Tonight.\n\nThe NYOP model won\u2019t completely end for now.\n\nHotwire, one of Priceline\u2019s biggest competitors, has \u201cHot Rate\u201d opaque deals for hotels, rental cars and airfares. For hotels, travelers enter the date, location and star rating they would like. The hotel name is revealed only after they book, and all reservations are final.\n\nIt also has Hot Rate airfare deals. For instance, a search for a flight from JFK to LAX on May 11 produced a deal if the traveler is willing to depart sometime between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. All the details, including the airline, are revealed after booking.\n\nA similar process works for rental cars.\n\nPriceline says it will continue to offer NYOP for hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cPriceline.com does not have plans to move away from Name Your Own Price for hotels,\u201d Jose says. \u201cTravelers see value in that offering and continue to book millions of deals at prices that are not available elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2G80lPc"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/technologylive/2017/12/19/cord-cutters-may-like-new-ew-channel-master-streaming-device-combines-live-tv-apps-such-netflix-and/960391001/", "text": "Channel Master targets cord cutters with new device that combines live TV, apps like Netflix\n\nChannel Master's Stream+ streaming media player ($99) lets cord cutters combine live broadcast TV with apps such as Netflix.

Time\n\nMEMPHIS \u2014 People of faith gather in a park at the U.S.-Mexico border in California every Sunday to celebrate communion.\n\nThey can't share the bread, wine or juice with each other through the wall that separates the two nations and bodies of Christ. They can barely see each other through the multiple layers of wire mesh.\n\nSeveral years ago, 50 United Methodist bishops stood on either side of the wall to celebrate communion. \"I know of no greater call to repentance than the border wall, which separates parents from children, husbands from wives, friends from friends,\" Rev. John Fanestil, of First United Methodist Church of San Diego, said afterward.\n\nAug. 30: In a storm, 'the church' is bigger than Joel Osteen's building\n\nAug. 19: Church rebukes white supremacy but can't ignore white privilege\n\nAug. 8: Faith in America: Elvis Presley and his American trilogy of baptisms\n\nThe call seems likely to get louder. Earlier this month, the Trump administration chose four companies, representing Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi and Texas, to build prototypes of a border wall \"between 18 and 30 feet high.\"\n\nCongress has set aside $20 million for prototypes. The Trump administration's 2018 budget includes $2.6 billion for \"tactical infrastructure and border security technology.\"\n\nMany Christian leaders and most of the largest denominations view President Trump's long-promised border wall as more spiritual fracture than tactical infrastructure.\n\n\"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian. This is not the gospel,\" Pope Francis said after he visited Mexico in 2016.\n\nSept. 13: Trump administration fast-tracks replacement of California border wall section\n\nAug. 31: Border wall prototypes will start going up in weeks\n\nEarlier this year, dozens of denominational leaders sent a letter to Congress opposing construction of a border wall.\n\n\"Our unique traditions call us to value the dignity and worth of every person and to protect creation,\" the letter said. \"A border wall and other forms of senseless border militarization are inconsistent with these values.\"\n\nNot all Christian leaders see it that way, especially those who have the president's ear.\n\n\"God is not against building walls!\" Robert Jeffress, the Southern Baptist megachurch pastor preached at an Inauguration Day service attended by President-elect Trump.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come, that\u2019s not a Bible issue,\" Franklin Graham told the Huffington Post in January.\n\nTruth is, there's already some sort of wall, fence or barrier along 700 of the U.S.-Mexico border's 2,000 miles. Two tall barriers run through Friendship Park on the border, established in 1971 as a symbol of friendship between two neighboring nations.\n\nAug. 29: Meadows: Freedom Caucus may be willing to wait to fund Trump's border wall\n\nAug. 24: Border wall dispute threatens once again to shut down government\n\n\"May there never be a wall between these two great nations. Only friendship,\" first lady Pat Nixon said at the park's inauguration as Secret Service agents cut three stands of barbed wire so she could hug Mexican children.\n\nThere's no hugging anymore at Friendship Park. Border security has been tightened a number of times since 1994's Operation Gatekeeper, the Clinton administration's effort to act tough on immigration.\n\nVisitors who want to visit with those across the border have two choices. They can see each other by standing behind barriers about five feet on either side of a tall slatted fence. Or they can talk privately and touch fingertips through thick metallic mesh.\n\nDuring weekly communion services, people of faith on both sides of the wall face the 12-foot barrier with hands held low, asking God's forgiveness. They reach their hands to the sky to receive God's pardon. Then they \"pass the peace\" by placing their hands on either side of the wall.\n\n\"By your Spirit make us one with Christ,\" they say with faith and conviction, \"one with each other, and one in ministry to all the world.\"\n\nDavid Waters writes for The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal.

(Photo: Jeff Gluck, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIf you're a NASCAR fan, you've likely already heard about Whisky River.\n\nNo, not the uptown Charlotte bar owned by Dale Earnhardt Jr. I'm talking about the original Whisky River \u2014 an Old West town Earnhardt built on his property.\n\nLike many of you, I'd seen it before on various NASCAR-related shows \u2014 such as ESPN and SPEED's programming \u2014 but never in person until Wednesday.\n\nEarnhardt opened his property for a commercial shoot \u2014 the Sprint All-Star Race has a Western theme again this year \u2014 so I got to visit Whisky River and watch some of the action.\n\nJUNIOR: Talks privacy, Danica Patrick's love life\n\nSince I was viewing the town through a first-timer's eyes, I figured some of you might be interested in what was there.\n\nFirst, the basics: Earnhardt got the idea for the town while watching an old 1990s-era episode of 60 Minutes, in which Willie Nelson was profiled. Nelson had an old movie set on his property and filled out the buildings to make them functional.\n\n\"I thought it was a great idea, and I'm really into the Westerns,\" Earnhardt said. \"I'm into the Spaghetti Westerns and all the stuff (Clint) Eastwood did in the '70s and '60s. It seems like a fun, mysterious time.\"\n\nEarnhardt and his buddies drew up the plans for the town on a napkin. They started with the Silverado Saloon \u2014 a full bar for the driver and his \"Dirty Mo' Posse\" group of friends to enjoy \u2014 then added more Western-style buildings around it.\n\nThere was an adjacent hotel \u2014 complete with several rooms and beds upstairs where friends could crash after a party \u2014 a sheriff's office with real working jail cells and other buildings like a post office, pharmacy, bank, barbershop, general store and church.\n\nWhisky River wasn't built all at once; the church, for example, was constructed roughly two years after the saloon was started. Earnhardt hasn't added any new buildings in \"a long, long time\" though, he said.\n\nAs a first-time visitor, it was pretty cool to stand on the dirt road that runs through the center of the town with buildings on both sides. Honestly, it wasn't that much of a stretch to imagine Whisky River had been around since the 1800s instead of the early 2000s.\n\nFor one thing, Earnhardt used some wood from an old mill that shut down in the Mooresville area. So while some of the walls and floors looked newer, there were a few areas which showed some age. In Earnhardt's \"Hilton,\" for example, there's an old wooden beam with paint chips ready to flake off at any second. The floors creak with every step.\n\nDespite all I'd heard about the town before arriving, I was very surprised at Earnhardt's attention to detail. I figured guests could go into a few of the buildings, but it turned out it was possible to enter every building. None of them were false fronts like you'd see at, say, Universal Studios.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

The post office had slots for mail, the bank had teller windows and the pharmacy had more than a dozen medicine bottles straight out of yesteryear.\n\nIt seemed like every detail was accounted for. There were old wagon wheels leaning up against the buildings, and there was even a tumbleweed tucked under a railing.\n\nEarnhardt said most guests don't go into the individual buildings, but he wanted the town to seem as real as possible. If he or one of his friends found a reasonably priced piece of memorabilia in an antique store, they'd buy it and add it to the collection inside the buildings, he said.\n\nSo what's Earnhardt's favorite building aside from the saloon (which is clearly the best, thanks to the billiards table, pinball machines and alcohol)? He likes the sheriff's office, he said, because his uncles Robert Gee and Jimmy Gee built the jail cells for him as a favor.\n\n\"They look really realistic,\" he said.\n\nEarnhardt appreciates when he has visitors to the property like Junior Johnson, Mike Helton and Richard Petty (who was part of the commercial shoot on Wednesday), because he imagines their reactions are similar to how his late father would have felt if he'd lived to see it.\n\n\"It means a lot for me to be able to show it off to people like that,\" he said.\n\nThese days, Earnhardt only comes down to Whisky River every two months or so. It's harder to find time now that he and his friends are older, he said.\n\nBut the memories linger, much like the nostalgia hanging over the Old West buildings.\n\n\"We've had a lot of fun down here,\" Earnhardt said. \"We've had a lot of good times in this place.\"\n\nFollow Jeff Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/WRJCyn"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lightpost/2017/04/10/how-manage-your-finances--demand-worker/100290188/", "text": "How to manage your finances as an on-demand worker\n\nAs companies like Uber, Airbnb, and GrubHub shape the economy with their on-demand models, the work world continues to evolve. The rapid expansion of this on-demand sphere pushes more and more people to join in the pursuit of setting their own schedule, working a variety of jobs at the same time, or honing their skill in a specific niche.\n\nManage your finances like a pro from the beginning. (Photo: Eric Busch)\n\nAccording to an Intuit study, 63% of these on-demand workers take these gigs to supplement their income with side hustles. 46% of on-demand workers say that on-demand jobs allow them to control their schedules. On-demand work is well within reach thanks to popular services like Uber and hiring networks like Moonlighting.\n\nWhile on-demand work provides flexibility and freedom that a traditional nine-to-five job cannot always provide, on-demand workers are self-employed in the eyes of the IRS. This means that these workers must track their business (gigs and freelancing work) finances separate from their personal finances and submit quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.\n\nWith some planning and financial know-how, you can learn how to manage and your finances and taxes as an on-demand worker. Here\u2019s how to get started. And find more tips and tricks laid out for you at Lightpost, USA TODAY's comprehensive, expert-sourced checklists for freelancers.\n\nTracking Expenses\n\nOn-demand workers must remember to track all expenses related to their on-demand work to comply with tax rules. Expenses for on-demand work could include:\n\n\u2022 Utilities, internet and cable\n\n\u2022 Car or transportation costs\n\n\u2022 Supplies related to your gigs (tools, fuel, insurance)\n\n\u2022 Additional homeowner\u2019s insurance (if you run your gig out of your home)\n\nQuickBooks Self-Employed can help you keep track of expenses so that you\u2019re ready at tax time. You can enter your expenses manually or take a photo of your receipts and QuickBooks Self-Employed will enter and categorize them for you. If your on-demand work involves driving, you can also use the built-in mileage tracker to keep track of your tax-deductible mileage.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s important to keep your business (on-demand work) expenses separate from your personal expenses for Uncle Sam.\n\nManaging Cash Flow\n\nSome types of on-demand work require that you submit invoices weekly or monthly to get paid. You will need to create, submit, and track your invoices so that you know how much money is coming into your account and whether you have enough money to cover your expenses. This is called cash flow management. Maintaining a positive cash flow means that you have enough money to cover your expenses and any purchases you may need to make. QuickBooks Self-Employed keeps all your finances in order so you know exactly where you stand, and you can see how much money is coming into and going out of your account each month.\n\nPaying Estimated Taxes\n\nEveryone must report their income to the IRS each year, whether they are a full-time employee working in a company or an on-demand worker. Full-time nine-to-fivers typically receive a W-2 from their employers and use it to report their income when they file taxes. Alternatively, on-demand workers usually receive a 1099 from each client or service provider (i.e. Uber) they worked for that calendar year. The 1099 form reports the total amount paid to the on-demand worker that year.\n\nWhen you work for a company full-time, the company is responsible for withholding taxes from your paycheck and delivering those tax payments to the IRS. Full-time employees don\u2019t need to worry about sending tax payments to Uncle Sam throughout the year because their employer does it on their behalf. However, when you are an on-demand worker, you are responsible to calculate and send the IRS your tax payments. The IRS requires on-demand workers to send estimated tax payments every quarter and then to file taxes by April 15.\n\nOne way to calculate your quarterly estimated tax payments is to use last year\u2019s tax return information. If you expect to make roughly the same amount of money this year that you made last year, you could take last year\u2019s total tax bill and divide it by four to get to a quarterly tax estimate. You could also use the IRS\u2019s Form 1040-ES to help guide you. QuickBooks Self-Employed is another easy option. Because it tracks your expenses, income, and other finances for your on-demand work, it can calculate estimated tax payments for you.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve calculated how much tax you owe each quarter, you can submit those estimated tax payments directly to the IRS via the EFTPS system. Remember to keep track of exactly how much money you\u2019ve sent Uncle Sam throughout the year, as you will use this information when you file taxes.\n\nWith a bit of research and practice, you can learn how to manage your finances and taxes as an on-demand worker.

(Photo: AP)\n\nWashington's farewell address wasn't delivered as a speech. Instead, it was published in a Philadelphia newspaper in September, 1796. And it wasn't his last address: He delivered his final State of the Union address three months later.\n\nIt's still considered the one of the greatest addresses in American history, and is remembered for the advice that Washington gave to the young country \u2014 advice succeeding generations have consistently ignored.\n\nWashington warned against entangling alliances with Old World powers: \"It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world, so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements,\" he wrote. \"I repeat, therefore, let those engagements be unwise to extend them.\"\n\nHe warned against partisanship: \"The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism.\"\n\nAnd he when warned against regional rivalries between North and South, Atlantic and West, he may well have been writing about red states and blue states.\n\n\"One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts,\" he wrote. \"You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection.\"\n\nThe enduring historical and cultural relevance of Washington's farewell is evidenced by the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, which sets passages of the speech to music in the Act II number \"One Last TIme.\" Indeed, Alexander Hamilton had tremendous influence in composing and editing the address.\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nThis April 17, 2015 shows the front of the U.S. $20 bill, featuring a likeness of Andrew Jackson, seventh President of the United States. (Photo: Bill Sikes, AP)\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson's stock has diminished in recent memory, mostly because of his treatment of American Indians. His opposition to paper money has also led to a successful campaign to remove his portrait from the front of the $20 bill, replacing him with Harriet Tubman. .\n\nIndeed, almost half of his farewell address was devoted to a denunciation of monetary policy, including what he called \"mischiefs and dangers of a paper currency.\"\n\nBut his address was also optimistic, reflecting a maturing of the early republic. \"Our Constitution is no longer a doubtful experiment, and at the end of nearly half a century we find that it has preserved unimpaired the liberties of the people, secured the rights of property, and that our country has improved and is flourishing beyond any former example in the history of nations,\" he wrote.\n\nJackson quoted from Washington's address, which he said \"should be cherished in the heart of every citizen to the latest generation,\" and again warned of regional factionalism.\n\n\"Mutual suspicions and reproaches may in time create mutual hostility, and artful and designing men will always be found who are ready to foment these fatal divisions and to inflame the natural jealousies of different sections of the country. The history of the world is full of such examples, and especially the history of republics,\" Jackson wrote. \"What have you to gain by division and dissension? Delude not yourselves with the belief that a breach once made may be afterwards repaired.\"\n\nHarry Truman\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman holds up a copy of an election day copy of the Chicago Tribune, which, based on early election night results, mistakenly announced \"Dewey Defeats Truman\" for the benefit of the throng that turned out to greet him at St. Louis' Union Station on November 4, 1948. (Photo: BYRON ROLLINS, Associated Press)\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt took advantage of radio to communicate directly with the American people, but he died in office and never had an opportunity for a farewell. That left it to Truman to revive the practice of a farewell address in a radio speech from the Oval Office.\n\nTruman's farewell address was largely devoted to describing the job of the presidency, which he did in Trumanesque fashion.\n\n\"The greatest part of the president's job is to make decisions \u2014 big ones and small ones, dozens of them almost every day. The papers may circulate around the government for a while but they finally reach this desk. And then, there's no place else for them to go. The president \u2014 whoever he is \u2014 has to decide. He can't pass the buck to anybody. No one else can do the deciding for him. That's his job,\" he said.\n\n\"So, as I empty the drawers of this desk, and as Mrs. Truman and I leave the White House, we have no regret. We feel we have done our best in the public service. I hope and believe we have contributed to the welfare of this Nation and to the peace of the world.\"\n\nDwight Eisenhower\n\nIn this 1956 file photo, President Dwight Eisenhower is seen at his desk at the White House in Washington. (Photo: Anonymous, AP)\n\nLike Washington, Eisenhower used his farewell address to give largely ignored admonitions his successors. This was the speech that coined the term \"military-industrial complex.\"\n\n\"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist,\" he cautioned.\n\nPart of that complex was the government's increasing control over technological innovation, warning that scientific research \"could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.\"\n\nAnd he offered a word about deficit spending. \"As we peer into society's future, we \u2013 you and I, and our government \u2013 must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\"\n\nLyndon Johnson\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson in his State of the Union message before a joint session of Congress in 1964. (Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nHaving spent most of his career in the halls of Congress, a sentimental Lyndon Johnson returned there to deliver his farewell in the form of his final State of the Union address, delivered six days before the end of his presidency.\n\nHe outlined the successes of his \"Great Society\" programs, including Medicare, voting rights, Head Start.\n\n\"We have finished a major part of the old agenda. Some of the laws that we wrote have already, in front of our eyes, taken on the flesh of achievement,\" he said. \"These achievements completed the full cycle, from idea to enactment and, finally, to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country.\"\n\nBut his farewell also acknowledged a lack of progress overseas. \"I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore peace to South Vietnam.\"\n\nRichard Nixon\n\nIn this Aug. 9, 1974 file photo, Richard Nixon waves goodbye with a salute to his staff members outside the White House as he boards a helicopter and e resigns the presidency on Aug. 9, 1974. (Photo: AP)\n\nAs the only president ever to resign from office, Richard Nixon's farewell was not on his own terms. His 16-minute televised speech from the Oval Office lacked much of the vitriol that history remembers him for.\n\n\"I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interests of America first,\" he said. \"To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the president and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home.\n\n\"Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office,\" he said.\n\n\"To those who have not felt able to give me your support, let me say I leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed me, because all of us, in the final analysis, have been concerned with the good of the country, however our judgments might differ,\" he said. \"I shall leave this office with regret at not completing my term, but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your president for the past five-and-a-half years.\"\n\nGerald Ford\n\nPresident Gerald Ford pardons Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, Sept. 8, 1974. (Photo: Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library)\n\nHaving succeeded Nixon in office, Gerald Ford is the only president to deliver a farewell address but not an inaugural. The occasion again was the State of the Union Address.\n\n\"Like President Washington, like the more fortunate of his successors, I look forward to the status of private citizen with gladness and gratitude. To me, being a citizen of the United States of America is the greatest honor and privilege in this world,\" he said.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, I once asked you for your prayers, and now I give you mine: May God guide this wonderful country, its people, and those they have chosen to lead them. May our third century be illuminated by liberty and blessed with brotherhood, so that we and all who come after us may be the humble servants of thy peace. Amen.\"\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nIn this April 25, 1980 file photo, President Jimmy Carter prepares to make a national television address from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, on the failed mission to rescue the Iran hostages. (Photo: AP)\n\nJimmy Carter's farewell address, delivered from the Oval Office, was as much the beginning of his post-presidency as it was the end of his presidency, signalling his enduring work in human rights over the next four decades.\n\n\"The struggle for human rights overrides all differences of color or nation or language. Those who hunger for freedom, who thirst for human dignity, and who suffer for the sake of justice, they are the patriots of this cause,\" he said. \"I believe with all my heart that America must always stand for these basic human rights at home and abroad. That is both our history and our destiny.\"\n\n\"The battle for human rights, at home and abroad, is far from over,\" he said. \"As I return home to the South, where I was born and raised, I look forward to the opportunity to reflect and further to assess, I hope with accuracy, the circumstances of our times. I intend to give our new president my support, and I intend to work as a citizen, as I've worked here in this office as president, for the values this nation was founded to secure.\"\n\nRonald Reagan\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan (Photo: SCOTT STEWART, Associated Press)\n\nIn his final Oval Office address, Ronald Reagan hearkened back to the \"shining city on a hill,\" the biblical reference from Jesus' \"Sermon on the Mount\" that formed the basis of much of his campaign imagery.\n\n\"I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it still,\" he said.\n\nReagan spoke longingly of returning to his California ranch, and ended with a nod to the Reagan revolutionaries that ushered in an era of more conservative government.\n\n\"Once you begin a great movement, there's no telling where it will end. We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world,\" he said. \"My friends: We did it. We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.\"\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush\n\nFormer President George Bush shown in a 1992 file photo. (Photo: RON EDMONDS, Associated Press)\n\nGeorge Bush's farewell address was unconventional by modern standards. Though historians consider his speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to be his farewell, he himself didn't consider it as such.\n\nStill, it's easy to detect an air of finality in the speech to cadets in the West Point mess hall. \"I am about to get on with the rest of my life,\" he said. \"But before I do, I want to share with you at this institution of leadership some of my thinking, both about the world you will soon be called upon to enter and the life that you have chosen.\"\n\nWhat followed was a reflection on America's role in the world following the end of the Cold War.\n\n\"Yes, the end of the cold war, we would all concede, is a blessing. It is a time of great promise. Democratic governments have never been so numerous,\" he said.\n\n\"But this does not mean that there is no specter of war, no threats to be reckoned with,\" he said. \"And already, we see disturbing signs of what this new world could become if we are passive and aloof. We would risk the emergence of a world characterized by violence, characterized by chaos, one in which dictators and tyrants threaten their neighbors, build arsenals brimming with weapons of mass destruction, and ignore the welfare of their own men, women, and children. And we could see a horrible increase in international terrorism, with American citizens more at risk than ever before.\"\n\nBill Clinton\n\nPresident Bill Clinton poses for photographs after addressing the nation from the Oval Office in the White House June, 10, 1999. (Photo: JOYCE NALTCHAYAN, AFP)\n\nFamous for his longwindedness, Clinton's Oval Office goodbye is actually the shortest presidential farewell on record \u2014 just 1,109 words.\n\nHe left with three thoughts about the nation's future, encouraging succeeding generations to pay down the national debt, embrace globalism and accept diversity.\n\n\"As for me, I'll leave the presidency more idealistic, more full of hope than the day I arrived, and more confident than ever that America's best days lie ahead,\" Clinton said. \"My days in this office are nearly through, but my days of service, I hope, are not. In the years ahead, I will never hold a position higher or a covenant more sacred than that of president of the United States. But there is no title I will wear more proudly than that of citizen.\"\n\nGeorge W. Bush\n\nPresident George W. Bush pauses in the Oval Office after addressing the nation on his strategy for Iraq, Thursday, Sept. 13, 2007. (Photo: J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE, AP)\n\nLike most of his presidency, George W. Bush's Oval Office farewell was devoted mostly to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the wars that followed. In what seemed like a rare moment of introspection, he seemed to ask history not to judge him too harshly.\n\n\"Like all who have held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks. And there are things I would do differently if given the chance. Yet I've always acted with the best interests of our country in mind. I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right. You may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made, but I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions,\" he said.\n\nQuoting Thomas Jefferson, he ended on an optimistic note: \"I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.\"\n\n\"It has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your president. There have been good days and tough days. But every day I have been inspired by the greatness of our country and uplifted by the goodness of our people. I have been blessed to represent this nation we love. And I will always be honored to carry a title that means more to me than any other, citizen of the United States of America.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ih9l79"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/driveon/2016/12/29/teslas-autopilot-system-appears-predict-car-crash/95953872/", "text": "Tesla's Autopilot system appears to predict a car crash\n\nCould Tesla's Autopilot system have predicted that the two vehicles in front of it would collide?\n\nA still frame from a dashcam video on YouTube that purports to show a Tesla warning of a crash that was about to occur ahead of it. (Photo: YouTube)\n\nThat's the mystery around a dashcam video that appears to show the collision warning system in a Tesla beeping a second before the vehicle strikes the back end of a SUV, sending it tumbling, the electric car blog Electrek reports. The blog says the crash occurred on a highway in the Netherlands, as recorded by a Model X crossover.\n\nNo official comment from Tesla, but the electronic sound just before the crash is indeed the sound made by the electric car's forward collision warning system.\n\nTesla released new software earlier this year to try to make improvements in its Autopilot partial self-driving system. Tesla put more reliance on radar, rather than other sensors, and gave the car the ability to bounce radar waves underneath the vehicle in front of it. It is designed to detect if an unseen vehicle ahead of the one in front makes a sudden stop, which can lead to chain-reaction rear-end crash. It's unclear if that's what happened in the case of this accident on a Dutch highway.\n\nThe improvements beamed to Tesla cars came after a high-profile crash that killed a Tesla driver while the Autopilot system was engaged. While Tesla acknowledged that the system was unable to detect a truck about to cross its path, it appeared the driver wasn't ready to step in and hit the brakes. Tesla says Autopilot is not a full self-driving system and drivers need to stay attentive.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hwKr2O"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/cruiselog/2013/07/11/guide-new-cruise-ships-order/2506049/", "text": "Our guide to the hottest new cruise ships on order\n\nWhat's next from the world's largest cruise lines?

But a deadly scandal is about to tear down their seemingly ideal lives \u2026\n\nMaddox Crawford\u2019s sudden death sends Gabriel Bond reeling. Not only is he burying his best friend, he\u2019s cleaning up Mad\u2019s messes, including his troubled company. Grieving and restless, Gabe escapes his worries in the arms of a beautiful stranger. But his mind-blowing one-night stand is about to come back to haunt him \u2026\n\nMad groomed Everly Parker to be a rising star in the executive world. Now that he\u2019s gone, she\u2019s sure her job will be the next thing she mourns, especially after she ends up accidentally sleeping with her new boss. If only their night together hadn\u2019t been so incendiary\u2014or Gabe like a fantasy come true \u2026\n\nAs Gabe and Everly struggle to control the heated tension between them, they discover evidence that Mad\u2019s death was no accident. Now they must bank their smoldering passions to hunt down a murderer\u2014because Mad had secrets that someone was willing to kill for, and Gabe or Everly could be the next target \u2026\n\nWhy you should read it: I love the idea behind a group of close heroes each getting their book and Happy Ever After. Shayla Black and Lexi Blake do the best combustible attraction and energy between heroes and heroines, and Scandal Never Sleeps is no exception. Gabe is hot, alpha, and the way he connects with Everly is just wow! Definite recommend for Shayla Black and Lexi Blake fans as well as readers looking for something hot and sizzling.\n\nINTERVIEW WITH SHAYLA BLACK\n\nTell us about this new series!\n\nShayla: Think spicy romance meets nighttime soap. Each book contains its own happily-ever-after and a new mystery to solve. We\u2019re excited for you to meet The Perfect Gentlemen. Between us, they can be anything but \u2026 however, that\u2019s part of their charm. They\u2019re a wealthy, powerful brotherhood of friends who dominate in industry, espionage, society, politics and love.\n\nHow do you balance the mystery, suspense and steam?\n\nShayla: Both Lexi and I approach plots very similarly. We devise internal and external conflicts that feed off one another and create these suspense elements we both love to write. The steam actually balances the tension of the mystery woven throughout this book and this series. So all the facets of the plot might leave you breathless but for different reasons. And while Scandal Never Sleeps is sexy (but not erotic), we wanted to give it a healthy dose of heat. What good is a bad boy who can\u2019t make you blush a little?\n\nWhat can readers expect for book two?\n\nShayla: In book two of The Perfect Gentlemen series, Seduction in Session (January), you can expect more of this brotherhood of friends to stick together while trying to solve the deepening mystery of their recent tragedy. You\u2019ll also learn more about each guy and have a whole lot of fun watching the next of the \u201cPerfect Gentlemen\u201d fall in love. This hero and heroine are complete polar opposites, and it makes for some fantastic comedic moments.\n\nWhat business would you be a high-powered executive of?\n\nShayla: If we weren\u2019t writing, Lexi and I would totally be executives at a winery, specifically involved in quality-control testing. LOL! Seriously, we both love a good Sauvignon Blanc. In fact, we dedicated this book to one of our favorites!\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nShayla: Lexi and I are both working on solo projects. Lexi is launching a new series with Berkley in 2016, so she\u2019s working on that. I am buttoning up the last of our edits from Seduction in Session and beginning to work on Wicked Lovers book 11, which should release next July. Title coming soon!\n\nFavorite line from SNS?\n\nShayla: This snippet is one of our favorite lines because it shows a bit of the byplay between our heroes and some of their humor. It certainly makes Everly, our heroine, grin.\n\nA tall, muscular man with chocolate eyes and black hair in a buzz cut joined them, glancing at her with a smile. \u201cHello. My name\u2019s Dax. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\nGabriel\u2019s eyes narrowed and he put a hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHer name is I Saw Her First.\u201d\n\nDax put his hands up as if to concede the point. He looked terribly amused. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a lovely name\u2026\u201d\n\nCourt of Fives by Kate Elliott\n\nWhat it\u2019s about (courtesy of Little, Brown):\n\nIn this imaginative escape into an enthralling new world, World Fantasy Award finalist Kate Elliott begins a new trilogy with her debut young adult novel, weaving an epic story of a girl struggling to do what she loves in a society suffocated by rules of class and privilege.\n\nJessamy\u2019s life is a balance between acting like an upper class Patron and dreaming of the freedom of the Commoners. But at night she can be whomever she wants when she sneaks out to train for The Fives, an intricate, multi-level athletic competition that offers a chance for glory to the kingdom\u2019s best competitors. Then Jes meets Kalliarkos, and an unlikely friendship between a girl of mixed race and a Patron boy causes heads to turn. When a scheming lord tears Jes\u2019 family apart, she\u2019ll have to test Kal\u2019s loyalty and risk the vengeance of a powerful clan to save her mother and sisters from certain death.\n\nWhy you should read it: Jes is a fantastic heroine, and her family is all kinds of awesome! Kate Elliott writes complex and intense relationships, and she shines in Court of Fives. The book is a slow build, but I loved the social classes and really hope the sequel has more romance and more on the world of Patrons and Commoners.\n\nTell us about this new series!\n\nKate: The short version: Little Women meet American Ninja Warrior in a fantasy setting inspired by ancient Egypt.\n\nThe longer version: Court of Fives is a YA fantasy about a girl named Jessamy who wants nothing more than to run the Fives, the most popular athletic competition in the country of Efea. Efea is a conquered country, ruled by foreigners who call themselves Patrons, while Jes herself, and her three sisters, have a Commoner mother, one of the underclass.\n\nJes accidentally meets Lord Kalliarkos, a very highborn Patron lord, and discovers that he also runs the Fives and needs her help to train. When Kal\u2019s scheming uncle tears Jes\u2019 family apart, she\u2019ll have to test Kal\u2019s loyalty and risk the vengeance of a royal clan to save her mother and sisters from certain death.\n\nTell us about the villain!\n\nKate: I very much enjoyed writing Lord Gargaron, Kal\u2019s uncle. He is ambitious, ruthless and extremely effective. Even better, because he\u2019s in a position of power in the society, no one except the heroine even thinks he\u2019s doing anything wrong by taking the actions he does. That makes his plans all the more difficult to resist.\n\nHow was writing Kal and Jes as friends, love interests, and competitors?\n\nKate: Because of the gulf that separates their respective stations in Efean society, I had to show how their unlikely friendship makes heads turn and how little they have in common. But at the same time I got to reveal how much they can relate to each other as \u201cadversaries\u201d (what the athletes who run the Fives are called). For me as writer the best part came in showing how two competitive people with a similar passion drive each other to take risks they couldn\u2019t have managed alone.\n\nWould you be a Patron or Commoner? Would you be at the games?\n\nKate: I would be a Commoner, someone who had run the Fives when Jes\u2019 age but wasn\u2019t good enough to be an elite competitor so became a poet instead. I would absolutely be watching the games, just like I\u2019m a regular viewer of American Ninja Warrior. I\u2019m super excited that one of the competitors headed for the Vegas finals reads my books!\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nKate: The first volume of my New Adult epic fantasy, Black Wolves, arrives in bookstores on Nov. 3, from Orbit Books. One of my early readers calls it \u201cJane Austen\u2019s Persuasion meets Dragon Age.\u201d It has giant eagles and the reeves who patrol with them, a murdered king, a disgraced captain and a young woman about to uncover a family secret that has been deliberately locked away for generations.\n\nAt the moment I\u2019m working hard on revisions of the second Court of Fives novel, coming next year.\n\nFavorite line from Court of Fives?\n\nKate: The last line, but it\u2019s a spoiler.\n\nJessie Potts, also known as Book Taster, adores books in all forms.

(Photo: Ivan Sekretarev, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A group advocating a more aggressive policy in Ukraine, Europe, the Middle East and Asia has been hired by the Pentagon to develop future military alliances in the regions as the Obama administration is moving more heavy weaponry into the Baltic states.\n\nPentagon records show the military's Office of Net Assessment commissioned the Center for European Policy Analysis for a study and war games called Gaming Allies: Geostrategic Change and Alliances on June 5. The office is traditionally quiet about the details of its studies; the contract announcement said CEPA will conduct \"a study on shifting dynamics in U.S. alliance networks in East Asia, the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe.\"\n\nCEPA is led by A. Wess Mitchell, a former adviser to Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, and the group receives much of its funding from a foundation run by Laurence Hirsch, a Dallas investment firm owner and large donor to Republican politicians.\n\nArticles and academic papers written by Mitchell and other CEPA scholars have called for moving defenses closer to the borders of Eastern European and Baltic nations with Russia and abandoning the policy of \"strategic patience.\"\n\n\"While the post-Cold War West may have hoped that Russia might eventually become a supersized version of Poland,\" Mitchell wrote in a March article about Russia, \"with liberal institutions and a de-militarized foreign policy, what we got instead was a latter-day version of Carthage \u2014 a sullen, punitive power determined to wage a vengeful foreign policy to overturn the system that it blames for the loss of its former greatness.\"\n\nThe United States, Mitchell and Czech military official Jan Havranek wrote in October 2013, need to build new relationships to cope with Russia and that Central European governments have lost faith in the United States. \"The U.S. presence in the region lacks any long-term strategic rationale and hence staying power,\" they wrote.\n\nCEPA did not respond to request for comment on the contract.\n\nHirsch, CEPA's chairman and the former CEO of the home products company Centex, now runs the investment firm Highlander Partners. Federal campaign records show he has given more than $300,000 to Republican candidates and political committees since 2012. An attorney, Hirsch has a master's degree in international policy from Johns Hopkins University. Tax returns from his Hirsch Family Foundation show the charity has given CEPA $650,000 annually in the last three years for which tax records are available.\n\nThe Office of Net Assessment is a think tank inside the Pentagon that helps identify future challenges for the military and attempts to guide policy. It has paid for the research of analysts at the Naval Warfare College studying the body movements of world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA 2008 study obtained by USA TODAY in February speculated that Putin suffered from Asperger's syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum. The report, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, said the condition \"affects all of his decisions.\"\n\nThe Obama administration, which has been trying to keep European nations in line on tougher economic sanctions against Russia, has been moving toward a more confrontational position against Russia. Last year, Russia seized control of Crimea, a peninsula jutting into the Black Sea that had been part of Ukraine.\n\nIn February, military officials outlined the movement of heavier equipment, such as tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles, to Eastern Europe and the Baltic states \u2014 the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. By early 2016, there will be enough pre-positioned equipment for a U.S. military brigade.\n\nOn Monday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the developing policy was still in its early stages.\n\nEarnest said the United States and its NATO allies discussed the need for more rapid deployment of troops at a summit in Wales last year.\n\n\"That is a treaty that the United States and this president is serious about upholding,\" Earnest said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1MLshkr"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/appinsider/2015/03/04/trivia-crack-review/24383609/", "text": "'Trivia Crack' tests your knowledge with social twist\n\nAlthough it's been available for over a year, Trivia Crack has morphed into the hottest new game for Android and iPhone users.\n\nIn Trivia Crack, players collect characters across six categories, such as Sports or History. (Photo: Etermax)\n\nSo, what is Trivia Crack? It's a fun game similar to Trivial Pursuit with a strong social emphasis, allowing players to vote for questions and even create their own.\n\nThe game features two modes: Classic and Challenge. Classic pits two players -- either friends or random opponents -- against each other in a Trivial Pursuit style matchup. Players answer questions across six categories: Sports, Entertainment, Art, Science, History and Geography.\n\nAfter answering three consecutive questions correctly, players can earn a character representing the category by correctly answering the next question. Categories are selected by spinning a wheel, and players can also lock up a category by landing on the Crown and correctly answering the next question. The first player to nab stickers in all six categories wins.\n\nChallenge features several players answering 12 questions across categories within a set time limit. The person with the most correct guesses wins.\n\nAs players improve and win games, their experience level increases, which means the questions get tougher. Players can also view their profiles to study their strongest and weakest categories.\n\nIn Trivia Crack, as players ramp up their experience level, the questions get a lot tougher. (Photo: Etermax)\n\nPlayers can spend coins to earn more time answering a question or get extra guesses. Additional coins are earned by winning or in-app purchases.\n\nTrivia Crack also allows players to ask the questions. Users can create their own questions, rate other questions or translate them into another language. Players review their list of suggested questions, which acquire at least 85% of positive votes to make the cut. If a question is rejected, the app will offer a reason, such as it's a repeated question.\n\nThe free version of Trivia Crack feature ads after every wrong answer, appropriate incentive to keep guessing correctly, since some of the ads are so tough to close, players must restart the app. There's also a paid, ad-free version for $2.99.\n\nDespite the ad issues, Trivia Crack is really fun. It's easy to play, and the social elements along with ability to create your own questions make this game a no-brainer to download.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1AK7yFR"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/dispatches/2014/12/31/miami-hottest-new-hotels/20881407/", "text": "New in Miami: Hotels as hot as its beaches\n\nCLOSE Fontainebleau Miami Beach has its own boat which goes out every day to catch fresh fish for the hotel's on-site restaurants.

(Photo: SANACORE)\n\nMIAMI\u2014Miami's hotel scene is just as hot as its beaches.\n\nThis year, the city had major boutique and lifestyle hotel openings including the Thompson Miami Beach, Metropolitan COMO, and Ian Schrager's highly-anticipated EDITION, designed in partnership with Marriott.\n\nMany other hotels are expected to open in the next two years, including the luxury Faena Hotel, SLS lux Hotel, a Yotel, and InterContinental Hotel Group's Hotel Indigo.\n\nMarriott also has grand plans for an AC Hotel, the brand it recently imported from Europe to appeal to younger travels. (The first AC Hotel opened in New Orleans in December.)\n\nWhile South Beach always gets most of the attention, many hotel developers are betting on other parts of the city, including Midbeach, the area north of 23rd Street that has up until now been mostly residential. Most travelers would only go to that part of the beach to hit the hip club and restaurants at the Fontainebleau.\n\nThe Downtown/Brickell area is also now a booming area, with several large real estate and retail developments in the works.\n\n\"Downtown Miami is emerging as a high-energy place to live, shop and work,\" said David Arditi, principal of Aria Development Group, which is building the Yotel, set to open in 2017. \"There is strong demand for urban-chic residential apartments, and Miami's appeal as an international destination is at an all-time high.\"\n\nUSA TODAY took a tour of a few of the new properties. Here's what we found.\n\nThompson Miami Beach\n\nWalk into the new Thompson Miami Beach in Midbeach, and you know you're in Miami\u2014albeit Miami in the 1950s.\n\nThe Art Deco building is decorated in bright colors. The 380 rooms have yellow-patterned carpets and accented pillows. Furniture has rounded edges rather than square corners. The two pools have yellow and orange cabanas.\n\nThe Crown Room, the second-floor lounge, serves classic cocktails in a dark setting that looks like it could be the setting for a \"Mad Men\" scene.\n\nOutside by the pool is another bar called the 1930s House. It is actually a house from the 1930s that was moved to this spot.\n\n\"It's really reminiscent of the '50s and '60s, of what Florida and design and construction were back then,\" says General Manager Brett Orlando.\n\nOrlando says the hotel is trying to appeal to both tourists and locals. That's why the valet parking fee is just $5\u2014almost unheard of in Miami.\n\nLocal celebrity chef Michelle Bernstein was in charge of creating the food and beverage concept. She came up with Seagrape, named after an indigenous Florida fruit that she recalls pointing out to her mom when she was a child on the beach.\n\n\"It was that a-ha moment that reminded me of the past and of my future at the hotel,\" she says.\n\nBernstein is incorporating some of the dishes she was known for at her wildly successful Michy's restaurant, which she plans to re-open, with those that the hotel's chefs have created.\n\n\"We really married everything together to create a menu that is approachable,\" she says.\n\nThe ingredients are local. She scours Miami's farmers' markets for fresh produce. The fish is caught by former classmates turned fishermen.\n\nShe's also trying to lighten up the dishes. The menu emphasizes fish, but even heartier meals, such as short ribs, come in a sauce that is not too heavy. Don't expect to see too many starches on your plate.\n\n\"You can feel sated without feeling gross,\" she says. \"We wanted to appeal to the palate of the people down here as well as all the people who are visiting.\"\n\nInfo: Thompsonhotels.com/hotels/thompson-miami-beach\n\nStarting rate: $359/night\n\nThe lobby of the new EDITION hotel in Miami. (Photo: EDITION Hotels)\n\nEDITION\n\nIan Schrager is often credited with creating the boutique hotel concept.\n\nMany industry insiders were surprised when he teamed up with Marriott, a hotel giant that hasn't always been known for thinking outside of the box.\n\nTheir partnership has resulted in EDITION hotels in Istanbul and London.\n\nWith EDITION Miami Beach, which opened in early December in Midbeach, Schrager has created a hotel where one can sleep, eat, work, and play in over-the-top fashion.\n\nThe hotel has what Schrager calls \"a sort of red-light district, but legal for the wild at heart.\"\n\nA micro-club\u2014a modern-day version of Schrager's legendary Studio 54 in New York City\u2014has soundstage-quality sound and lighting systems created by Patrick Woodroffe, who has curated concerts for Lady Gaga and Beyonce.\n\n\"This picks up where Studio left off,\" Schrager says. \"A visual riot, sensory overload, a truly serious dance club.\"\n\nThere's also a bowling alley with luminescent bowling balls and an indoor ice-skating rink.\n\nAn outdoor resort area is named Tropicale, in honor of the Tropicana, the historic 1950s Havana nightclub. At night it turns into an outdoor nightclub. There's a Terrace Bar overlooking the pool area and a private beach with an outdoor movie screen, a fire pit and private bungalows.\n\nOne reminder that EDITION is a Marriott hotel is the Hot Shoppe, an homage to the original A&W root beer stand that the Marriott family started in 1927.\n\nMichelin star chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is in charge of the food and beverage venues, which include the Market, a reinvention of the 24-hour coffee shop. Schrager bills it as part patisserie, part boulangerie and part salumeria. It offers casual gourmet fast food and dining in an open air caf\u00e9.\n\n\"It's a place that can be your first stop of the day, and your last stop of the night,\" he says.\n\nFor a more formal dining experience, guests can go to the Matador Room, where Vongerichten is offering up a menu with Spanish, Caribbean and South American influences.\n\nAnd if you ever want to sleep, the hotel has 294 rooms, which include bungalows and a penthouse.\n\nInfo: Editionhotels.com/miami-beach\n\nStarting rate: $429\n\nMetropolitan COMO\n\nAnother newbie in the booming Midbeach area is the Metropolitan COMO, an Asian brand.\n\nIt is much smaller and less flashy than its competitors, but its European sophistication makes it an enticing alternative.\n\nThe hotel has just 74 rooms spread out over nine floors in a pre-war Art Deco building designed in 1939 by American architect Albert Anis.\n\nRooms are minimalist with beds covered in white linens, pastel-colored walls and terrazzo floors rather than carpeting.\n\nA room with an ocean view at the new Metropolitan COMO in Miami. (Photo: Graciela Cattarossi)\n\n\"We are the anti-Miami hotel,\" says sales director Thibaut Asso. \"I feel like I'm going back in time.\"\n\nThe restaurant, Traymore, is filled with seafood and local ingredients. The Traymore Bar is billed as Miami Beach's first Gin Club with monthly events and tastings.\n\nCOMO hotels have a focus on wellnesss, so you can also get healthy juices either at the restaurant or the pool bar.\n\nThe Shambhala Urban Escape spa features Asian-based therapies and a rooftop hydrotherapy pool.\n\nInfo: Comohotels.com/metropolitanmiamibeach\n\nStarting rate: $400\n\nRedbury South Beach\n\nSouth Beach is still a hot destination in Miami, and this relative newcomer has added to its trendiness.\n\nThe 69-room hotel is part of Sam Nazarian's SBE Entertainment empire, which includes the SLS hotels.\n\nThis chic boutique hotel is not on the beach but it is across the street from its sister property, the Raleigh, which is oceanfront. The SLS South Beach, also an oceanside sister property, is nearby.\n\nThe bar at the new Cleo restaurant at the Redbury South Beach hotel. (Photo: Ryan Forbes)\n\nRedbury makes up for the lack of oceanfront property with its massive rooftop deck with a pool. The roof has a lovely view of nearby Art Deco buildings.\n\nThe Redbury has whimsical rooms designed by magazine photographer and music video director Matthew Rolston. Each room has a record player with actual records to play.\n\nWhile the hotel has been around for more than a year now, it is celebrating the opening of its new restaurant Cleo.\n\nIt's the third Cleo in the SBE family. Run by chef Danny Elmaleh, it joins its Los Angeles and Las Vegas outposts.\n\nThe Mediterranean inspired menu has tapas that range from $7 to $16\u2014inexpensive for South Beach.\n\nInfo: Theredbury.com/southbeach/\n\nStarting rate: $297\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1zvQZgJ"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/idolchatter/2014/09/26/carrie-underwood-greatest-hits-new-single/16262017/", "text": "Carrie Underwood to release 'Greatest Hits,' new single\n\nCarrie Underwood will release 'Greatest Hits: Decade #1' Dec. 9.

Chiltern Street, Andre Balazs's first London property, is opening imminently (its restaurant, already up and running, is the hottest table in town), and the city's first Mondrian and Nobu hotels are coming in the next few months.

All have the usual five-star touches like marble bathrooms, but the real luxury is the floor-to-ceiling windows with those bird's-eye views (binoculars are provided).

Instead, there are loads of curated media (the hotel employs a \"cultural engineer\" to choose the gallery exhibits as well as the DVD selection and vinyl LPs available to borrow) and in-house outlets for local businesses such as a juice bar, a (locally roasted) coffee bar, and a florist, plus extras such as tech workshops and bike tours of the area.

(Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images)\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 The hackers responsible for the wave of breaches at big retailers this holiday season very likely began testing a method to infect thousands of point-of-sale systems in big retail chains in January 2013.\n\n\"This is a well-funded adversary taking their time to develop very specific malware to go after very specific targets and a big payday,\" says Chris Petersen, chief technology officer at security intelligence firm LogRhythm. \"This is organized crime applied to cybercrime.\"\n\nLast April, Visa issued an alert to retailers about network intrusions targeting POS data at grocery merchants in early 2013. The technique discovered by the payment card giant involved installing a memory-parsing program on Windows-based cash register systems and back-of-house (BOH) servers. The clever piece of malware was designed to extract data from magnetic-striped payment card transactions.\n\nCLOSE Some experts say thieves were likely inside Target computers for months before the data breach took place. VPC\n\nBy last November security analysts and forensic investigators were quietly discussing cases of big retail chains getting hit by memory parsing attacks, says Avivah Litan, banking security analyst at research firm Gartner.\n\n\"I can't give you names, but there were others hit,\" Litan says. \"Target got hit the biggest.\"\n\nThe breaches of customer databases at Target, Neiman Marcus and other yet-to-be-disclosed retail chains have all the earmarks of a methodical attack used in cyber espionage known as an Advanced Persistent Threat.\n\nAn APT attack often begins with intelligence gathering. Researchers tap search engines and social media websites to build dossiers on employees likely to have privileged access to wide parts of a company network. Personalized e-mails carrying a viral PDF attachment or Web link get sent.

He was 84.\n\nVIDEO: Legendary crooner Andy Williams has died\n\nWilliams, who was one of the most popular vocalists of the 1960s as well as an avid golfer, died at home in Branson, Mo., where he owns the Moon River Theatre. Moon River -- by Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini -- was one of Williams' signature songs. On Twitter, fans are saying farewell to our \"huckleberry friend.\"\n\n\"The old cliche says that if you can remember the 1960s, you weren't there,\" the singer once recalled. \"Well, I was there all right, but my memory of them is blurred -- not by any drugs I took but by the relentless pace of the schedule I set myself.\"\n\nSaid Kathie Lee Gifford on Today this morning: \"He had perhaps the most beautiful male voice ever. Perfect pitch.\"\n\nWilliams was also well-known in the 1970s and '80s for his Christmas television specials. Known for his affable, easygoing personality, he hosted the Grammys, the Golden Globes and the People's Choice Awards numerous times.\n\nThe crooner is survived by his wife, Debbie, and his three children, Robert, Noelle and Christian. Williams had the children with French-born dancer Claudine Longet. They divorced in 1975, and the following year she was charged with fatally shooting her boyfriend, alpine ski racer Spider Sabich, in Aspen. Williams made headlines as he stood by her side throughout the public trial. He married Debbie Meyer in 1991.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network.\n\nUPDATE, 1:30 p.m. ET: Neil Portnow, president and CEO of The Recording Academy remembered Williams in a statement: \"Andy Williams' smooth voice and casual style turned the songs he sang into timeless classics and made him one of America's top pop singers. As host of his own weekly variety series, The Andy Williams Show, he helped put both established and emerging talent in front of American audiences. Williams was the first host of the live Grammy Awards telecast and hosted the show for seven consecutive years, beginning with the 13th Annual Grammy Awards in March 1971 at the Hollywood Palladium. The entertainment industry has lost a giant piece of its living history today, but Williams' legacy will forever be enshrined in the annals of music and television.

The meeting would be the first ever between the nations\u2019 two leaders after more than a half-century of tensions between their countries.\n\nThe setting chosen for the summit was a luxury resort hotel in Singapore.\n\nPageantry and surreal moments\n\nAfter weeks of preparations, the two adversaries finally came face to face on June 12 in a day filled with pomp and ceremony.\n\nTrump arrived first; Kim showed up 17 minutes later. In front of a backdrop of American and North Korean flags, the two leaders stood on a red carpet and shook hands, which itself was a history-making gesture and one that critics said gave too much prestige to Kim, a dictator who imprisons and murders his opponents.\n\nThen they got down to business. The four-hour summit included a private one-on-one meeting between Trump and Kim and their translators, which was followed by a bilateral meeting between delegations of the two countries.\n\nAmid the serious discussions, there were lots of surreal moments. Trump and Kim participated in frequent photo ops that showed them getting along. They took a lunchtime stroll on the hotel grounds. Trump gave Kim a peek inside of his presidential limousine known as \u201cThe Beast.\u201d\n\nDespite their past animosities, Trump and Kim had nothing but nice things to say about each other. Trump said he and Kim had developed \u201ca very special bond.\u201d Kim said he and Trump had decided \u201cto leave the past behind.\u201d\n\nAnd then the the two leaders who had spent months threatening to annihilate each other signed an agreement pledging to work toward the \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to write a new chapter,\u201d a triumphant Trump said at a news conference.\n\nMore: Trump: Obama was on brink of 'a big war' with North Korea.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nThe agreement\n\nThe accord signed by Trump and Kim may have promised denuclearization, but the document itself was vague about when and how that might happen. It included no deadlines, no timetables and no process to verify that North Korea was living up to the terms.\n\nForeign policy analysts said the deal was so vague that it was meaningless. But Trump and his team insisted they didn\u2019t expect the summit to produce a comprehensive nuclear deal. Instead, they said, they were looking to set up a process to negotiate an agreement in which North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for economic assistance from the United States and other countries.\n\nIn the months since that agreement was signed, however, talks between the two countries have stalled as they struggled over the details of how to go forward with North Korea\u2019s disarmament and the removal of U.S.-led sanctions.\n\nThe North Koreans haven\u2019t provided the U.S. with an inventory of their nuclear weapons and facilities, which many analysts say is the key first step toward denuclearization. The U.S. has refused to lift economic sanctions against North Korea, saying Kim must first start relinquishing his nuclear arsenal.\n\nNorth Korea has suspended nuclear and missile tests and dismantled its nuclear testing site and parts of its rocket engine test facility. But members of the Trump administration say North Korea is still developing a nuclear weapons program, raising doubts about whether Kim is really committed to denuclearization. Satellite footage indicates that North Korea is still running its main nuclear complex.\n\nTwo things that have happened as a result of the agreement: The United States has suspended some joint military exercises with South Korea amid the ongoing negotiations. And North Korea has returned what it said was the remains of 55 American troops who served in the Korean War.\n\nMore: Trump-Kim summit: North Korea must do something 'meaningful' to denuclearize before sanctions relief\n\nThe Vietnam summit\n\nSo what can we expect to happen at Trump\u2019s and Kim\u2019s second summit in Hanoi this week?\n\nLook for the Trump administration to demand that North Korea verify what it has done so far to eliminate its nuclear weapons and provide a list of nuclear sites that it intends to dismantle.\n\nThe administration also is likely to press North Korea for a specific time frame for doing away with those weapons.\n\nNorth Korea will probably use the second summit to try to win more concessions from the U.S. and demand the lifting of sanctions that have hurt its economy.\n\nKim also is expected to seek a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIt's not because the GOP supports the transformation of the electric grid from fossil fuels to renewable energy called for in the plan to combat climate change. Or because Republicans agree with the approach the plan lays out for boosting Americans' economic security and giving people access to affordable health care.\n\nJust the opposite.\n\nGOP officials expect the road map offered by Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and longtime environmental advocate Sen.

Since then, Trump has said he had considered firing Comey even without that recommendation and has said the Russia investigation was on his mind when he made the decision.\n\nMay 5, 2017: Angella Reid\n\nThe chief usher was fired for unclear reasons; it is unusual for a chief usher to be dismissed and they typically hold their positions for several years and over a number of administrations.\n\nFeb. 13, 2017: Michael Flynn\n\nThe national security adviser was mired in controversy after news reports surfaced that he had misled officials, including Vice President Pence, about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. He resigned shortly afterward.\n\nJan. 30, 2017: Sally Yates\n\nThe acting attorney general, a holdover from the Obama administration, was dismissed after she refused to defend the first iteration of Trump's travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2HPjT81"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/11/05/what-trumps-border-wall-progress/1898283002/", "text": "President Donald Trump reviews border wall prototypes, Tuesday, March 13, 2018, in San Diego. (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nAs President Donald Trump presses to get $5 billion for border-wall construction \u2014 with the threat of a government shutdown as leverage \u2014 he's issued a flurry of tweets.\n\nIn one Twitter burst, Trump said his administration has \"already built large new sections\" of the \"great wall\" that he spoke of while campaigning for president.\n\nTo date, however, the Trump administration has not constructed one foot of border wall that fits any description he gave during his presidential campaign.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump insisted that existing fences were not adequate, and he would build something different \u2014 an impenetrable wall at least 20 or 30 feet tall. After Trump took office, federal officials had construction companies bid on and build prototypes meeting those standards.\n\n.....Ice, Border Patrol and our Military have done a FANTASTIC job of securing our Southern Border. A Great Wall would be, however, a far easier & less expensive solution. We have already built large new sections & fully renovated others, making them like new. The Democrats,..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2018\n\nInstead of building new walls, the Department of Homeland Security has replaced old barriers in some border areas and erected new fences in a few locations.\n\nThose metal barriers mostly are 12 to 18 feet high. They are the same design fences built under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.\n\nIndeed, Congress funded the projects with a stipulation that the new border structures built under Trump must use existing fence designs \u2014 meaning the new prototype wall designs couldn't be used.\n\nBut in practice, the distinction between \"wall\" and \"fence\" has begun to blur.\n\nMore than a year ago, Trump and the Department of Homeland security began labeling all border barriers as \"walls,\" even though they are the same fences he belittled during his campaign.\n\nToday, as the president pushes Congress to finance funding for his most symbolic and concrete campaign vision, it is undecided whether a border wall already is under construction, whether the \"big, beautiful wall\" will ever get built \u2014 or whether, under the new definition, it already has been.\n\nThe answer, arguably, has become a matter of interpretation, as well as congressional approval.\n\nWhat's Trump's border wall progress?\n\nNew border barriers built under the Trump administration amount to a few miles of fencing.\n\nA USA TODAY NETWORK project in 2017 examined the entire 2,000-mile border and showed most of it has no fence and no wall.\n\nThat doesn't mean border crossers are flowing freely across the border, though.\n\nAs President Barack Obama left office, apprehensions of illegal crossers by the Border Patrol was at a historic low. At first under Trump, they plummeted further. Arrests rose in the last year, but the numbers remain near the lowest levels in decades.\n\nHelicopter footage documents just 354 miles of fences designed to stop people on foot. Almost all are near cities and towns. The un-fenced border is mostly remote, wild and distant from roads or construction supplies.\n\nIs Trump's border wall the same as the border fence?\n\nCLOSE Supporters of President Trump defend the border wall during a rally as Trump visits the border wall prototypes several miles away in Otay Mesa, California. David Wallace/The Republic\n\nOn the campaign trail, supporters regaled Trump with a slogan, \"Build the wall!\"\n\nEven after taking office, he was clear that the border wall would be new and different from other fences, saying \"We\u2019re going to have a wall that works. We\u2019re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.\"\n\nSince then, administration officials seemingly revised that plan. In April, Homeland Security Director Kirstjen Nielsen announced that new barriers would be considered walls, even if those fences are being built to replace existing fences.\n\nMost fencing along the border consists of tall steel posts, known as \"bollards.\" For decades, Border Patrol agents have talked about \"bollard fences.\" Now, their agency calls them \"bollard walls.\"\n\nUnder Trump's administration, fewer than 40 miles of new barriers have been erected or are approved, and most of those simply replace old fencing.\n\nIn tweets Dec. 11, the president wrote, \"People do not yet realize how much of the wall\u2026has already been built.\"\n\nHe said the border \"is now secure\" and asserted that undocumented immigrants \"have not been able to get through our newly built walls.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump said Democrats in Congress are trying to stop border-security efforts by denying funds for a wall.\n\n\"If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall,\" he added.\n\nCLOSE Could a wall be built? What would it do? Journalists from the USA TODAY NETWORK flew and drove the entire length of the U.S.-Mexico border in search for answers. This is what they found. A USA TODAY NETWORK video production.\n\nTHE WALL: Documentaries explore reality of the border.\n\nWhere is Trump's border wall being built?\n\nIf you consider the barrier projects built recently to be \"border walls,\" here are some of the locations:\n\nNone of those barriers look like the wall prototypes built near San Diego, which Trump visited and praised earlier this year.\n\nIs Mexico going to pay for the border wall?\n\nSo far, no.\n\nCongress approved $1.6 billion this year for border security, which Trump has described as a \u201cdown payment\u201d on his wall. That's U.S. tax dollars.\n\nNot all of that $1.6 billion goes toward fences or walls.\n\nThe $1.6 billion is intended for general border security measures, which includes new technology along the border and repairs to existing barriers. Only $641 million was dedicated to building 33 miles of new barriers.\n\nThe bill that allocated that funding also contained a notable caveat: \"The amounts ... shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 ...such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.\"\n\nIn other words: The funding can be used only for previous designs, not any new designs for Trump's border wall idea.\n\nBut the new designs might not be usable, anyway.\n\nWhat's the status of the border wall prototypes?\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection awarded eight contracts to six companies to build border-wall prototypes in 2017.\n\nFour were made of reinforced concrete, and another four incorporated additional construction materials. Construction began on Sept. 26 on a strip of federally controlled land near San Diego.\n\nTrump later visited the site, and remarked that he preferred a wall design that allowed Border Patrol agents to see through the barrier.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did field tests on the 30-foot-tall structures. In August, the U.S. Government Accountability Office published a report about the results of that testing.\n\nThe tests revealed many of the prototypes, as built, failed to meet the same design standards that Customs and Border Protection had set out in its calls for submissions. The evaluations found that all four concrete prototypes had \u201cextensive\u201d construction challenges.\n\nThe GAO report did not disclose the cost-effectiveness of the eight prototypes.\n\nIs Trump's border wall being built or not?\n\nDetails aside, the administration has been consistent in saying any border-security construction will be considered part of a \"wall\" or \"wall system\" under Trump.\n\n\"To us, it's all new wall,\" Nielsen said at a White House briefing in April. \"If there was a wall before that needs to be replaced, it's being replaced by a new wall. This is Trump's border wall.\"\n\nICYM the livestream, after @SecNielsen\u2019s arrival to the 30ft Calexico #border fence, two men welded this to the fence.

AP's Eric Tucker provides a debrief of the hearing. (Jan. 29) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A federal judge on Thursday ordered Roger Stone, the flamboyant political consultant charged with obstruction and lying to Congress, to stop talking about his case after he posted a picture of the judge on Instagram as part of a fundraising appeal.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had previously allowed Stone, an author who discusses politics on television, radio and the internet, to continue speaking so long as he didn't do so around the courthouse. She had ordered lawyers and witnesses not to discuss the case.\n\nJackson's stricter restrictions came after Stone posted a picture of the judge Monday next to what appeared to be a gun\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nJackson said Stone made his living through messages, so that she didn\u2019t believe the picture was chosen at random. She said the image could have stoked an angry crowd to violence.\n\n\u201cMr. Stone couldn\u2019t even keep his story straight on the stand,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow.\" She added: \"There's nothing ambiguous about crosshairs.\"\n\nJackson said her rules are designed to prevent the case from degenerating into a circus.\n\n\u201cThe publicity can\u2019t possibly subside if the defendant is out there fanning the flames,\u201d Jackson said as Stone leaned his head on his right fist. \u201cI have serious doubts about whether you\u2019ve learned any lesson at all.\u201d\n\nStone formally apologized for the \"improper\" post in a court filing Monday and repeatedly did so again Thursday while testifying under oath.\n\n\"I believe I abused the order,\" Stone said. \"I\u2019m kicking myself over my own stupidity, but not more than my wife is kicking me.\"\n\nStone, an off-and-on adviser to President Donald Trump, is charged by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team with obstruction and lying to Congress for statements about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released damaging emails about Democrat Hillary Clinton before the 2016 election. Stone was released on personal recognizance after he was arrested at his Florida home last month.\n\nStone has pleaded not guilty and said any misstatements were mistaken recollections rather than intentional lying. He has insisted he is innocent and attacked prosecutors on both social media and through television interviews.\n\nIn setting the hearing, Jackson also warned she could revoke Stone\u2019s release before trial. She didn't do that, but warned that she might if he violates her gag order.\n\nAt one point, Jackson asked whether Stone knew how to search with Google.\n\n\u201cHow hard was it to come up with a photograph that didn\u2019t have crosshairs in the corner?\" Jackson asked.\n\nStone said the image was chosen by one of five volunteers he couldn't specify because nobody would acknowledge giving it to him, but that he selected the picture from a couple of choices and posted it. Stone said he later studied the image and determined that it featured a Celtic occult sign rather than a gun's crosshairs.\n\n\"It was an error, your honor,\" Stone said. \"Nobody will own up to it,\" he said of his volunteers.\n\nOne of the prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis, asked for restrictions on Stone's speaking outside court.\n\nStone's lawyer, Bruce Rogow, opposed greater restrictions. Stone testified that his consulting has dried up, leaving it difficult for him to put food on the table and pay the rent.\n\nRogow said the posting was the only mistake Stone had made under pretrial release, and that he posed no threat of fleeing the charges or danger to the community.\n\n\"Really what he\u2019s asking for is a second chance,\" Rogow said. \"It was completely inappropriate. It\u2019s indefensible.\"\n\nRogow had suggested that if Jackson did restrict Stone's speech, the restrictions should apply to talking about the charges, the prosecutors and the judge.\n\n\u201cIt was outrageous to see that picture, to see that text,\" Rogow said. \u201cThe government should not be criticized by Mr. Stone.\"\n\nThe Instagram post featured text pleading for contributions to his legal defense fund and noted that Jackson had been appointed by former President Barack Obama. Stone said the post had been a random picture taken from the internet and wasn't meant to threaten or disrespect the judge.\n\n\u201cPlease inform the court that the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted,\u201d Stone wrote in a note filed with the court Monday. \u201cI had no intention of disrespecting the court and humbly apologize to the court for the transgression.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service, which protects federal judges, was aware of Stone's post, spokesman Drew Wade said on Tuesday.

(Photo: Charles Dharapak, AP)\n\nA senior Pentagon official approved $280,000 in fraudulent bonuses to seven officials preparing to leave the department, according to a report released Thursday by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General.\n\nEllen Ardrey served as the director of human development at the Pentagon's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), a massive agency based in Springfield, Virginia, that employs 14,500 people who provide situational intelligence on everything from counterterrorism and weapons of mass destruction to wildfires and Super Bowls.\n\nAccording to the report, Ardrey allowed senior officials at the NGA to downgrade their positions for one pay period, which in turn allowed them to leave the agency with a $40,000 early-retirement buyout incentive. Such \"early out\" packages can be quickly approved by agency directors such as Ardrey for non-senior officials when an agency goes through downsizing, but they must receive clearance from the undersecretary for defense for all senior officials.\n\nAfter a two-year investigation that included interviews with 16 witnesses and the review of more than 31,000 emails, the Inspector General's Office found that Ardrey complained that the process to receive approval for buyouts for senior officials was \"onerous\" and \"slow,\" telling leadership, \"The juice ain't worth the squeeze on this.\"\n\nInstead, Ardrey suggested to senior officials that they downgrade their position for one pay period to speed up the process. She told investigators that she believed she was acting legally and that there was no law or policy that prohibited her from temporarily downgrading senior officials to hasten their buyout packages.\n\n\"However, DoD buyout incentive subject matter experts that we interviewed told us that Ms. Ardrey\u2019s downgrade and buyout incentive plan for senior officials was 'gross mismanagement,' 'improper use of government resources,' 'looks like a shell game just to get them the opportunity to get an incentive,' and would only make sense 'if somebody wanted to get around the onerous approval process \u2026 for senior officials,' \u201d the report concluded. \"We agree.\"\n\nIn a response to the report, Ardrey wrote that she had conducted similar downgrades at another government agency and that other employees at the NGA told her the process \"was not prohibited.\"\n\n\"The investigation\u2019s preliminary conclusion is based on inference and opinion, with insufficient evidence to substantiate intentional circumvention of DoD policy,\" Ardrey wrote. \"The recommendations I developed \u2026 were consistent with policy and followed established authorities.\"\n\nArdrey could not be reached for comment.\n\nAn NGA statement on Thursday said Ardrey is still employed at the agency, and that officials there are dealing with the report internally.\n\n\"NGA encourages its employees to report misconduct and sets a high standard of conduct for all employees, regardless of grade,\" the statement read.\n\nThe investigation into Ardrey's actions started in 2017 when four anonymous complaints were filed against her, according to the report.\n\nMore: Sexual assault, harassment spikes at military academies, strategies fail to stem crisis\n\nMore: Pentagon Do-si-don't: Selling Girl Scout cookies in office earns general a demerit badge\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/inspector-general-report-pentagon-official-gave-280-thousand-fraudulent-bonuses-nga-geospatial/2937818002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/trump-administration-breaks-up-some-migrant-families-heres-how-cbp-border-sabraw-separate/2836085002/", "text": "CLOSE Amid public outcry over the thousands of migrant children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep families together. Here\u2019s a wrap-up of everything that led to this moment. Just the FAQs\n\nThe Trump administration has been blocked from systematically breaking up migrant families, but hundreds of children crossing the border continue to be separated from their parents in a process requiring none of the oversight used to remove children in the United States from their homes, according to a USA TODAY review of the system.\n\nSeparating a child from a family in most communities requires a child welfare specialist and involvement of the judicial system, often with a judge scrutinizing the case for months or even years.\n\nAt the border, the decision is made solely by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in the field. No child welfare specialist is required, and no judge is involved in a decision that cannot be appealed.\n\nRebekah Fletcher, a supervising attorney at Kids in Need of Defense, a group that provides lawyers to migrant children in U.S. courts, says the removal of a child from a family in the U.S. is, by design, a difficult, multi-layered process involving people from multiple branches of government. But not so for children at the border.\n\n\u201cTo put those similar types of determinations solely in CBP\u2019s hands \u2026 the room for error and the room for misinterpretation is dangerously high,\u201d she said.\n\nEven the border protection agency characterizes its family separation process as \"brief and expeditious in nature,\" according to a statement provided to USA TODAY.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw both ordered the Department of Homeland Security to stop separating migrant families as a systemic practice in June.\n\nThere is an exception, however: When a parent presents a danger to a child.\n\nWhat constitutes a \"danger\" is not clearly defined, but it can include obvious cases of abuse, where the child is covered in bruises, and harder-to-detect cases, where immigration agents believe a child is in peril.\n\nIn the seven months after Trump and Sabraw issued their orders, Homeland Security separated at least 245 children from their parents in part by using the danger exception, according to a Department of Justice estimate filed in court on Wednesday. Immigration attorneys believe the number is far higher, with the Texas Civil Rights Project releasing a report on Thursday that found 272 separations in that time period in the McAllen, Texas, area alone.\n\nA Border Patrol agent speaks with Central American immigrants after they crossed the border from Mexico on on Feb. 1, 2019, in El Paso, Texas. (Photo: John Moore, Getty Images)\n\nImmigration attorneys and family law experts say the process used to separate children, most commonly carried out by Customs and Border Protection agents, has been shrouded in mystery, provides no due process for the parents and is vulnerable to abuse or mistakes.\n\nThe agency defended its family separation process as one that balances the desire to \"maintain family unity to the greatest extent operationally feasible\" with strong protections for children who may be in danger.\n\n\"When handling children it is a practice to always err on the side of caution and to act in the best interest of the child,\" a statement from the agency said. \"The moment of suspicion that a threat to a child exists, it becomes an inquiry and potentially an investigation into the welfare of that child.\"\n\nMore: Democrats grill Trump administration officials over family separation policy on the border\n\nMore: Watchdog: Thousands more migrant children may have been separated at border than previously reported\n\n'An end run' around the courts?\n\nDemocratic and Republican lawmakers alike expressed shock over the process during a committee hearing in the House Energy and Commerce Committee this month. The separation process will be further scrutinized in a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday.\n\nThe ACLU briefly raised the question in federal court on Thursday, when lawyers appeared before Sabraw as he continues to monitor the reunification of more than 2,800 children separated under the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy. But lawyers spent the majority of that hearing debating whether the government should be required to identify potentially thousands of other families that were separated before the \"zero tolerance\" policy was officially announced.\n\nSabraw has allowed the government to continue separating more families under the exception to ensure that migrant children are not being trafficked or abused.\n\nACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said the most recent separation cases have shown that the government may be abusing that exception.\n\n\"The government appears to be doing an end run around the court order by unilaterally declaring parents a danger and failing to give parents the ability to rebut that charge,\" Gelernt said.\n\nWhen a migrant family crosses the border, either legally at a port of entry or illegally between ports, an immigration agent processes the case. That includes taking down basic information \u2013 names, birth dates, country of origin, whether families are applying for asylum or other forms of protection.\n\nThe family members are given a medical check and entered into various databases to determine if they have immigration violations or criminal backgrounds, Customs and Border Protection said. The immigration agent also tries to verify the parent-child relationship to ensure the child isn't being trafficked by a smuggler posing as a parent.\n\nAll the while, the agent observes the family to gauge whether the parent poses a danger to the child. But no clear-cut definition of such danger exists to guide Border Patrol agents when making that determination. Complicating the decision are language barriers or children too young to offer information.\n\nAgency officials said their decisions are based on multiple U.S. laws and regulations that govern the treatment of migrant children in government custody. None of those lays out a process for separating a migrant parent from his or her child.\n\nIs child 'afraid of parent ... or Border Patrol?'\n\nThe separation process, which is being challenged in court, was explained to USA TODAY by a senior Border Patrol official who was authorized to speak only if his name was withheld.\n\nThe official said his agents can generally determine if a child has been abused based on the agents' experience as law enforcement officers and history of interviewing suspects. Agents don't receive any training on identifying child trauma. \"We're not trained behavioral scientists,\" the official said.\n\nBut the Border Patrol official said agents' experience as a father or mother can help them make the determination. The official said agents can orderan additional medical examination of the child to identify signs of injuries and can interview the parent and child separately to ensure that their stories line up.\n\n\"You size up people with their demeanor and you can tell if they're angry, if they're upset, if they had an altercation,\" he said. \"There's a lot of non-verbals that stand out.\"\n\nThroughout the U.S., that kind of analysis is usually done by child welfare experts who studied the field and are working for state or local child welfare agencies.\n\nVivek Sankaran, a clinical professor of law and director of the Child Advocacy Law Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, said identifying child trauma, and the cause of it, requires years of education and training.\n\n\"It is universal among mental health professionals that the idea of removing a child from a parent is one of the most traumatic things we as a society can do to the child,\" he said. \"So you want somebody who has been very well-trained to make sure that we need to inflict (a separation) on the child.\"\n\nEven a former Customs and Border Protection commissioner questioned whether agents should be conducting the child welfare investigations alone.\n\nGil Kerlikowske, who headed the agency in the Obama administration, said in an interview that migrants are being screened at one of the most stressful moments of their lives, having just completed an exhausting journey across Mexico during which they are frequently victims of robberies, kidnappings and sexual assaults.\n\nKerlikowske said agents are operating without information that is available in normal child abuse investigations, including a list of official visits to the home and interviews with neighbors and relatives.\n\n\"How do you determine whether the child is afraid of the parent, or afraid of the Border Patrol agent in the green uniform?\" he asked.\n\nCriminal history matters, but what crimes?\n\nAnother factor contributing to the evaluation is a parent's criminal history, either in the U.S. or in their home country. The U.S. government shares criminal databases with Central American countries and can identify whether there are warrants out for their arrest.\n\nBut the border protection agency did not specify what kinds of crimes it's researching.\n\nMichelle Bran\u00e9, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice Program at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, said she has seen cases where a parent is found to be a danger over immigration violations or minor criminal convictions that do not indicate whether the parent may abuse the child.\n\n\"There's a lot of people (in the U.S.) with all sorts of convictions and it doesn't even trigger a child protective services investigation,\" Bran\u00e9 said. \"If you have a shoplifting conviction, or didn't pay child support, or you stole a car, does that really put the child at risk?\"\n\nThe border agency says officers are allowed to get assistance from child welfare specialists from local and state agencies, but that is not a requirement, and the agency does not track how often such requests are made.\n\nThe final decision to separate a family is made by the front-line officer with approval from a supervisor. The decision is final and cannot be reviewed by a judge.\n\nOnce the decision to separate is made, the child is sent to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes custody of the child and starts searching for a suitable sponsor in the U.S.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection says its agents are required to flag the separation in each case file and provide a reason for the separation, but HHS officials and immigration attorneys say agents regularly fail to so do so.\n\nHHS spokesman Mark Weber said caseworkers ask all incoming children about their parents to make sure separated children are properly identified.\n\nFletcher, supervising attorney for Kids in Need of Defense, said the group gets the full picture of a child's separation only after filing a federal Freedom of Information Act request, which can take weeks or months to come back.\n\nCLOSE During a press conference in the Rose Garden, President Trump admitted that he didn't need to declare a national emergency to fund his border wall, but that he did it so he could \"get it done faster.\" USA TODAY\n\nBipartisan support for improving the process\n\nThough it has been difficult for any kind of immigration bill to pass Congress in recent years, Democrats and Republicans alike are starting to look into ways to improve the family separation process.\n\nIn the congressional hearing this month, Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said that there need to be clear guidelines to separate a family and that child welfare professionals need to be involved. Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Ind., agreed.\n\n\"We don't have a terrific system, we don't have standards, we don't have procedures,\" Brooks said. \"What should we be doing?\"\n\nSuggestions are plentiful. Cristina Mu\u00f1iz de la Pe\u00f1a, a mental health expert who testified before the committee, said the guidelines and practices that should be imposed on Homeland Security already exist in child welfare agencies around the country.\n\n\"We could adapt those guidelines in the immigration context and bring those professionals to really counsel the people on the ground,\" she said.\n\nKerlikowske, the former border protection commissioner, said the agency could hire a dozen child welfare experts in the four border states who could be on call and required to step in to evaluate any migrant parent suspected of abusing a child.\n\nSankaran, the University of Michigan Law School professor, suggested taking things a step further: Place all migrant families where abuse is suspected directly into the state juvenile court system.\n\nAnything short of that, Sankaram said, would only tinker with a Homeland Security process that is fatally flawed and prolong the anguish of family separations that should have been put to rest last summer.\n\n\"None of us would tolerate this process for our own families,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/trump-administration-breaks-up-some-migrant-families-heres-how-cbp-border-sabraw-separate/2836085002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/20/tucker-carlson-says-his-profanities-guest-were-heartfelt/2934668002/", "text": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson (Photo: Richard Drew/AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Fox News host Tucker Carlson used a portion of his show on Wednesday to address a now-viral video showing him cursing at a guest and calling him a moron during a segment that never aired.\n\nWhile admitting the profanity-laced comments were \"rude,\" Carlson said they were \"accurate\" and added: \"It was genuinely heartfelt.

The fight over wall funding led to a 35-day government shutdown \u2013 the longest on record.\n\nWhite House officials have said the emergency declaration and other budget maneuvers would free up an additional $6.6 billion, which would build at least 234 miles of border wall.\n\nAlong with Congress moving to void the order, the move has also drawn as number of legal challenges in court.\n\nSixteen states already filed a lawsuit over Trump's emergency declaration, arguing it exceeds the power of the president and unconstitutionally redirects federal money that Congress had set aside for other purposes.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/20/national-emergency-dems-resolution-block-trump/2931055002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/20/tulsi-gabbard-confronted-meghan-mccain-over-syrias-bashar-al-assad/2931405002/", "text": "CLOSE The congresswoman from Hawaii is joining a growing pool of Democrats ready to take on President Trump in 2020.

For those pre-ordering the new Galaxy S10, which goes on sale the same day, Samsung is including a pair of the new buds for free.\n\nA new \"quick pairing\" feature allows you to easily connect the Buds to a Galaxy phone or tablet through the company's SmartThings app, a feature that seems to mimic the ease of pairing AirPods with iPhones and iPads.\n\nAs with their predecessor IconX earbuds, you can answer calls or control play/pause through touch controls on the side of the Galaxy Buds.

The company also says a 15-minute quick charge in the case can provide the earbuds with \"1.7 hours\" of additional playback.\n\nFor comparison, AirPods are listed as having five hours of battery life on a single charge with its charging case providing an additional 24 hours of battery. Apple's site also says a 15-minute charge will give its earbuds three hours of battery life.\n\nWhile Samsung, Jabra, Bose and others have attempted AirPods rivals in the past, few have done so for a cheaper price than Apple's $159 option or with a pairing option that matches AirPods simplicity.\n\nOf course, with Apple rumored to be readying a release of its second generation of AirPods this year, the battle for this next round of wireless earbuds may only be just getting started.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/20/samsung-galaxy-buds-new-rival-apple-airpods/2932658002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2019/02/21/tech-tips-google-instagram-facebook-iphone-android/2925183002/", "text": "CLOSE Technology can be either amazing or annoying, depending on whether or not you know all the tricks to make it work for you! Here are a few hacks you need to try ASAP! Buzz60\n\nRemember shortcuts you could enact with a computer keyboard? Using a particular combination of CNTL, ALT and FN, you could quickly scroll through documents, open and close programs, and move elements around.\n\nThey still exist, of course. But nowadays, with so many tricks, niches and shortcuts, those special operations look downright quaint. Many operations are well known, and most of them are tiny and frivolous.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s a lot of fun to find a treasure trove of classic arcade games on your Android device.\n\nSome tricks remain obscure, and they can change your life. You might find yourself using one of these operations every day, but only if you realize it exists. To bring you up to speed, here are 10 of my favorite tech tricks \u2013 what they\u2019re for, how to use them and the ways they\u2019ll change your experience.\n\nThere are tons of technology shortcuts you can use to make your life easier. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n1. Use your voice instead of typing\n\nSince the dawn of computers, typing was the only way to get business done. Now, you give your fingers a break and dictate notes while you're walking, reply to messages while you're cooking, compose a literary masterpiece while you're in bed \u2013 the possibilities are endless.\n\nYou don't even have to download a separate app. Your iPhone or Android keyboard has a built-in voice-to-text feature. Just pull up your phone's keyboard, tap the mic icon and dictate away.\n\nIf your phone's built-in transcriber is too basic, you can get more features with apps like Dragon Anywhere for iOS and Android, or TranscribeMe, also available for iOS and Android.\n\nYour smartphone is tracking you: How to stop it from sharing data and sending ads\n\nBeyond Google search: Here are 7 services you should try instead\n\nYou can use Google\u2019s transcriber to dictate documents into Google Docs. Open a new document in Google Docs, and enable Voice Typing from the Tools menu. Then start dictating. Voice Typing recognizes commands like \"comma,\" \"period\" and \"new paragraph.\"\n\n2. Make routines using Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant\n\nEver wanted to automate a string of tasks with a single command? That\u2019s why Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa are equipped with \u201cRoutines.\u201d\n\nFor instance, you can say \"Alexa, I'm home!\" and Alexa can greet you, turn on your living room smart lights, read the daily news then play a specific music playlist.\n\nOr you can say \"Alexa, good night\" and have her reply back with \"sweet dreams,\" then lock your doors, set your thermostat to a certain temperature, turn off all your lights and play white noise to lull you to sleep. You can configure scheduled routines and have your virtual assistant perform sets of actions throughout each day.\n\nTo create a routine in the Alexa app, go to the menu then tap Routines. Tap the + sign to start a new sequence. Select \"When this happens\" then choose your trigger. The trigger can be a phrase, a schedule or a motion sensor event. Next, select \"Add action\" to start building the routine. To wrap it up, select the device you want to trigger the routine from, then tap Create.\n\nFor Google Home Routines, tap \"Menu\" on the upper left corner of your Google Home app. Tap More Settings>>Routines.\n\nUnder \"When,\" tap \"Add commands,\" enter your trigger phrase then click OK. To add an action, tap \"Add action\" under \"My Assistant should ...\" If you want to schedule a routine, tap \"Set a time and day\" under \"When\" instead.\n\nGoogle tricks: 15 amazing tip you never knew before now\n\nLooking to cut the cord?:A look at the best streaming boxes\n\nYou can actually post on Instagram through your computer. (Photo: Facebook)\n\n3. Post on Instagram from a computer\n\nInstagram has come a long way. The app was originally designed for casual snapshots, always cropped square, that mimicked the Instamatic cameras of decades past. They have long shed those strict parameters, but one thing remains challenging: posting to Instagram from a desktop or laptop.\n\nOne way is to first post a photo to another form of social media (such as Facebook or Twitter), then download the photo onto your phone or tablet and then post to Instagram.\n\nBut you can also do it directly, using Google Chrome. The process is a little convoluted, but it\u2019s the easiest way to get your high-quality DSLR or mirrorless images onto the platform.\n\n1. Open Chrome.\n\n2. Go to the Instagram website\n\n3. Right-click anywhere on the page\n\n4. Hit Inspect\n\n5. When the new screen appears, hit the little \u201csquares\u201d in the upper-middle, just above all the coding\n\nThis should show you the same display you would see on your phone. You can pick which kind of display you\u2019d prefer, including a range of iPhone, Galaxy, Nexus and other devices. You should see the same functions at the bottom, including the \u201cPlus\u201d sign, which will enable you to upload .jpg files from your desktop, or even take a photo.\n\n4. Speed up podcasts\n\nYou can speed-read an ebook, and you can scrub through a video. But many podcast listeners don\u2019t realize they can speed up their listening \u2013 and because the recording is digital, you don\u2019t lose much fidelity. You\u2019ll have to pay closer attention, but you can zip through a slow episode, or consume a long conversation, without missing a word.\n\nWhen you listen to a podcast, there is a player at the bottom of the screen. You might have to swipe up to see it. On Apple\u2019s Podcast app, for example, there is a number in the lower-left corner. The default is 1x and this option lets you hear the podcast at normal speed.\n\nSpeed listeners can tap this button and change the playback speed to 1 1/2x or 2x. There\u2019s also the option for 1/2x playback speed. I\u2019m not quite sure when you would actually want to listen to a podcast very, very, very slowly, but it\u2019s there if you need it.\n\n5. Crop a screenshot on a Mac\n\nSavvy Mac users have been pressing CMD+Shift+3 for years, which is the shortcut for a full screenshot. But if you want to cut out large sections of that image, either to hide certain parts of your desktop screen or because it\u2019s distracting from what you want to focus on, you can either edit it in an app like Photos or PicMonkey, or you can use this trick.\n\nHit CMD+Shift+4 and your cursor becomes a +. Click and drag to draw the portion of your screen that you want to capture. Voila! You can skip all the extra editing.\n\n6. Share a YouTube video at a precise point\n\nIf you see something in a YouTube video that you want to share at a particular location, you can get a link that takes people directly to that moment.\n\nClick the \"Share\" button below the video. Look for a checkbox below the link. It will automatically display the time at which you currently have the video stopped.\n\nYou can stick with this time or even choose a different time. Next, just copy the link and share it over your preferred social media service or email it to a friend. When someone views the link, the YouTube video will automatically skip right to the point you chose. Handy, huh?\n\n7. Get a copy of everything you\u2019ve posted on Facebook\n\nWith all the privacy troubles the company's been going through lately, lots of people are deactivating their Facebook accounts. But what do you do about all your status updates, the photos, videos and shares you've accumulated through the years \u2013 this digital scrapbook of your life?\n\nThere's a way to save all of your Facebook data and make it available for download.\n\nHere's how:\n\n1. Log in to your Facebook account and go to \"Settings\" >> \"Settings & Privacy.\"\n\n2. Scroll down then select \"Download Your Information\"\n\n3. In the next section, you can select (or deselect) the categories you want to include in your download data. It's quite extensive, so choose wisely. Obviously, the more categories you choose, the larger your file will be.\n\nOnce you've checked all the categories and the date range you want, select \"Create File.\" (HTML and medium quality media are fine for most people.)\n\nYour archive file can be massive, and it could take days before it becomes available. (Facebook will send you another email informing you that your file is ready for download.)\n\n8. Post on multiple social media accounts at once\n\nDo you juggle multiple social media accounts at the same time? Maybe you like cross-posting on different platforms at the same time to save time. It's terribly inefficient to keep copying and pasting the same status update on different sites, right?\n\nSave time managing your social media with tools like Buffer, Hootsuite or IFTTT. With their ability to post on different sites simultaneously (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) they can quickly disseminate a social media message, which is especially valuable for event planners and branding campaigns.\n\nCompose your post, add links, photos or videos, choose your platforms, then post. It's that simple. For the power user, these tools even have scheduling features and analytics to gauge how effective your posts are.\n\nFor casual use, both Buffer and Hootsuite have free plans that are good for three social media accounts. On the other hand, professionals who want to manage eight profiles and beyond can opt for their paid plans.\n\n9. Double-check your translation\n\nOnline translation is more powerful than ever, and it's especially useful for English-friendly languages like French and German. But it's unwise to rely on Google Translate or Facebook's translator without double-checking that the translation makes sense \u2013 especially for important correspondence with academic officers or potential business partners.\n\nHow do you do this without learning fluent Greek or Japanese? By translating your English text into another language, then back into English.\n\nFor example, I could translate the following phrase into Albanian: \"Three weeks from now, I will arrive in your capital city and would like to rent a red convertible.\" When I receive the translation, I copy and paste the Albanian text and reverse the languages. Translated back into English, you get: \"Three weeks from now, I will arrive in your capital, and I would like to rent a red booth.\"\n\nBooth? Apparently, one of those words can be easily confused. But if you phrase the original message as \u201cred convertible car,\u201d your message should be clear.\n\n10. Take a picture on your phone and find it on the web\n\nEver looked at an online photo and you just had to know more details about it? Maybe you're searching for its location, the date it was taken, a better resolution or other angles of its subject.\n\nA Google Images reverse search acts like a regular Google search, using an image instead of text. You can even reverse search faces or profile pictures to dig more information about an individual.\n\nTo do this, head on over to Google Image's search tool, click on the little camera icon then upload (or point it to the image's web address) and let Google do the walking.\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have?

The device packs six cameras \u2013 three on the back, two on the inside and one on the front, as well as 512 GB of storage and 12 GB of RAM.

Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY\n\nWhen the iPhone turned 10 in 2016, Apple went all out giving the phone a massive redesign. As one might expect, with the Galaxy S line hitting the same milestone this year, Samsung similarly spared no expense.\n\nSamsung is introducing several new Galaxy S10 models Wednesday: a more compact, $749.99 S10e with a 5.8-inch display, an $899.99 6.1-inch S10 and a $999.99 6.4-inch S10+.\n\nIn addition to those three main S10 models, which will be available for pre-order Feb. 21 and go on sale March 8, Samsung is adding a souped-up, 6.7-inch Galaxy S10 5G.\n\nThe 5G model will launch initially as a Verizon exclusive during the first half of 2019, before rolling out later to AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile.\n\n(l-r): Samsung Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10+, Galaxy S10e (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\n\nAll four phones run Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 855 processor and are packed with the latest specs, including a minimum of at least 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. A microSD card is available on the three non-5G models to add additional storage.\n\nUnlike recent iPhones and Android devices that cut out the top of the display for the front camera (also known as a \"notch\"), Samsung is taking a different approach on the S10, introducing what it calls an \"Infinity-O\" display.\n\nThis screen cuts out a hole for the front camera in the upper right corner to allow the display to maximize the entire front of the phone.\n\nThe S10e has two rear cameras, an ultra wide-angle and more standard wide lens, with an improved front 10-megapixel sensor. The S10 and S10+ have an additional zoom sensor on the back. The 5G adds a depth sensor on the back, bringing the total number of lenses to four.\n\nThe S10+ and 5G model will also each have a second depth camera on the front for improved portrait selfies, and in the case of the 5G model, improved augmented reality possibilities.\n\nSimilar to Google's Pixel line, Samsung is also upping its software on the S10's camera. The camera can automatically switch between the lenses, swapping between the sensors depending on the shot you are looking to capture and how zoomed in you are on your subject. A new \"shot suggestions\" mode will guide you to make sure your phone is properly aligned and the subjects are in focus.\n\nVideo recording will also be getting some upgrades with a \"super steady mode\" to keep your videos stabilized.\n\nAll phones are water resistant and pack now standard Galaxy features like Samsung Pay for making mobile payments. Stereo speakers remain on all the phones and, in a win for those who still use wired headphones, so does a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nPink, black, white, and blue will be the color options in the U.S. \u2013 a green option will also be offered internationally. Glass covers the back of the phones, though those who get the 512 GB or 1 TB S10+ will get an option for a more durable black or white model made out of ceramic.\n\nThe Galaxy S10 line in various colors. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\n\nBixby, Samsung's digital assistant similar to Siri or Alexa, is also still here but for those who don't use the feature, Samsung says a forthcoming software update will allow you to change the dedicated side \"Bixby button\" so that it summons a favorite app instead of the voice assistant.\n\nState of the line specs\n\nAlthough Samsung has dropped the iris scanning feature for unlocking the phone that has been found on recent Galaxy phones, the S10, S10+ and 5G each pack a fingerprint sensor underneath their displays to allow you to authenticate by pressing your finger on the screen.\n\nThe fingerprint scanning icon on the Galaxy S10+. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\n\nThe cheaper S10e places its fingerprint sensor on the power button along the side of the device. The S10e also lacks the curved display found on its pricier siblings.\n\nIn addition to the cutout, the S10 displays also reduce blue light exposure, which has been linked in studies to harming vision in recent studies, by 42 percent compared to previous Samsung screens. Apple, Amazon and Google have added features to limit exposure in recent software updates, but a hardware solution from Samsung is welcome.\n\nAll S10s support the latest 4G LTE networks as well as Wi-Fi 6, the latest Wi-Fi standard.\n\nWith beefy batteries across the line, Samsung has added a new feature called \"Wireless PowerShare\" to wirelessly charge other devices by placing them on to the new phone's back, so long as the S10's battery is above 30 percent.\n\nA Galaxy S10+ charging wirelessly off of another S10. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\n\nThis includes the company's updated $129.99 Galaxy Buds, which are Samsung's rival to Apple's AirPods. Because the S10 uses a technical standard known as Qi (pronounced \"chi\"), you can even charge an iPhone or other non-Samsung brand devices off of an S10.\n\nA powerful upgrade, but a pricey one\n\nAfter spending some brief time with the phones it's clear that Samsung has made some impressive improvements to what was already a powerful phone in the Galaxy S9. The shrunken bezels allow the phones, even the larger S10+ and 5G models, to keep the overall size manageable. The cameras in some quick shots looked to live up to the high bar set by prior Galaxy's.\n\nWhile I was unable to test the new video recording features, \"shot suggestions\" helped straighten photos and could be useful for amateur photographers who find themselves struggling to focus, their subjects aren't properly lit or their phone is not straight.\n\nOne area that will take some additional testing, however, is the new cutout display. While the placement of the cutout didn't bother me, and the display looked great across the three S10 models (even the S10e's slightly lower 1080p resolution), for the S10 Samsung's slightly changed display size could lead to larger black bars around videos on YouTube or Netflix that were shot for viewing on traditional televisions (something called \"letterboxing\").\n\nAs opposed to the early days of the modern smartphone 10 years ago, consumers today \"know what they want and they know what they're looking for,\" says Justin Denison, senior vice president of product strategy and marketing at Samsung Electronics America.\n\n\"Our strategy really is to provide the latest technology possible at every price point so that we can address the needs of as many of those consumers as possible,\" he said.\n\nWhile Samsung offers trade-in discounts to those looking to upgrade, including up to $550 for recent iPhones and Galaxy devices, it remains to be seen whether consumers will be as enamored with the latest Galaxy phones as they were with earlier models. Particularly at a time when carriers no longer subsidize phone prices as they did a decade ago.\n\nAt a starting price of $749.99 for the S10e, Samsung's cheapest is priced right next to Apple's 64 GB iPhone XR, with the S10 and S10+ slightly cheaper than entry-level 64GB iPhone XS and XS Max.\n\nThere is no price yet for the 5G phone, but with its larger screen and even more powerful specs it is possible this phone will be well north of the $1,000 mark.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/20/galaxy-s-10-samsung-celebrates-10th-anniversary-four-new-phones/2872525002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/10/09/listen-talking-tech-podcast/1580909002/", "text": "Listen to the Talking Tech podcast\n\nCLOSE Jefferson Graham offers tips on how to listen to the Talking Tech podcast via apps, speakers, TVs and the car.

Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY\n\nAlong with five phones, including a pricey foldable one, and a new set of earbuds, Samsung announced a line of fitness wearables on Wednesday at its Unpacked event in San Francisco.\n\nThe latest wearables to join the Samsung family include the Galaxy Watch Active, the Galaxy Fit and Galaxy Fit e.\n\nThe Galaxy Watch Active is the first Samsung device to feature blood pressure tracking. The smartwatch is also built with improved stress monitoring and sleep tracking. It automatically detects your workouts as well, including, biking, running the elliptical, and three other workouts.\n\nThat means you don't have to start them manually from the workout app.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Active (Photo: Samsung)\n\nThe gadget noticeably lacks the signature rotating bezel that was a staple in previous Galaxy smartwatches. Instead, you control the smartwatch using its touchscreen and two side-mounted buttons.\n\nThe $199.99 device, which works with both Android and iOs devices, launches March 8 and comes in silver, black, green and rose gold. It's significantly cheaper than the Galaxy Watch, which starts at $349.99, and the Apple Watch Series 4, which starts at $399.\n\nGalaxy S10: Samsung celebrates line's 10th anniversary with four new models, including 5G\n\nGalaxy Fold: Are you ready to spend $2,000 for Samsung's new foldable phone?\n\nThe Galaxy Fit and Fit e, on the other hand, cost $99 and will be released on May 31.\n\nThe Galaxy Fit retains heart rate and monitors sleep and stress. It will sync with a smartphone for notifications. Like the Active, the tracker is waterproof to a depth of 165 feet. It has a 0.95-inch Full-Colour AMOLED display screen.\n\nThe Galaxy Fit e is slightly smaller with a 0.74-inch PMOLED display.\n\nBoth bands look similar to the Gear Fit2 Pro bands. The design of each is relatively basic with a rectangular screen on the top of the lightweight band. They have standard health tracking functionality but with longer battery life. They also feature enhanced sleep analysis and smart stress management\n\nThe Galaxy Fit comes in black and silver finishes and has a full-color AMOLED display. The Fit e comes in black, white and yellow color options.\n\nSamsung is no stranger to smartwatches.\n\nIn fact, the smartphone maker has been releasing them since before the Apple Watch was launched.

Buzz60\n\nA new moon was discovered orbiting Neptune, scientists announced in a study Wednesday, joining the other 13 we already knew about.\n\nThe moon, named Hippocamp after the sea creature of Greek mythology, is Neptune's smallest moon, with a diameter of only 21 miles.\n\nHippocamp orbits close to Proteus, the largest and outermost of the planets' inner moons. The largest moon of Neptune is Triton, in an orbit farther out.\n\nCompared with the planet\u2019s other inner moons, Hippocamp is tiny, \"which suggests a violent history for the region,\" Anne Verbiscer, a University of Virginia astronomer, said in a companion article in Nature.\n\nThe moon may have formed from ejected fragments of the larger moon after it was hit by a comet billions of years ago, according to the study. This supports the idea that all of Neptune's seven inner moons were formed and shaped by powerful collisions with comets.\n\nThe inner moons of Neptune. Shown here is the location of Hippocamp, compared with those of Neptune\u2019s rings and other inner moons. The relative sizes of the moons are accurate; however, the moons have been enlarged with respect to their orbits by a factor of 20, to highlight the small size of Hippocamp. The scale bar (lower right) is 6,200 miles. (Photo: Nature)\n\nAll of the inner moons are thought to be younger than Neptune, having formed relatively soon after the capture of Triton.\n\n\"The first thing we realized was that you wouldn't expect to find such a tiny moon right next to Neptune's biggest inner moon,\" said study lead author Mark Showalter, a SETI astronomer. \"In the distant past, given the slow migration outward of the larger moon, Proteus was once where Hippocamp is now.\"\n\nMore: Huge storms spotted on Uranus and Neptune\n\nThe seven inner moons of Neptune are shown at a consistent set of sizes, along with Neptune (right). (Photo: Mark R. Showalter, SETI Institute)\n\nIt's so small that it wasn't detected in 1989 during the Voyager 2 flyby of Neptune. Hippocamp was spotted by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope. Showalter and his colleagues discovered it using a special image-processing technique that made Hubble\u2019s cameras extra-sensitive.\n\nMore: Astronomers discover 12 more moons orbiting Jupiter, including an 'oddball'\n\n\u201cThe authors were actively hunting for moons to add to Neptune\u2019s retinue,\u201d Verbiscer said. She said that unlike Hippocamp, other recent discoveries in our solar system have been serendipitous: Last year, planetary scientists reported the discovery of 12 moons of Jupiter, which were identified during a search for the elusive Planet X that is proposed to lurk in the outermost region of the solar system.\n\n\"Applying the techniques that were used to find (Hippocamp) might result in the detection of other small moons around giant planets, or even planets that orbit distant stars,\" Verbiscer said.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the sea monster Hippocamp (aka HIppocampus) often is depicted as having a horse's upper body along with the lower body of a fish.\n\nThe study was published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature.\n\nCLOSE If you\u2019re bored with the weather here on Earth, well let's take a look at what\u2019s happening elsewhere in the solar system.

People love Instant Pot\u2014so much so that the brand\u2019s amassed 1.6 millions fans on Facebook and sold 300,000 units during the last Prime Day alone. It seems like an entire ecosystem of cookbooks, recipe blogs, and forums have sprung up around their magical multi-cookers.\n\nIf the public\u2019s enthusiasm for Instant Pot recipes has convinced you that an Instant Pot is worth the money and has you hopping on the train to faster cooking, you still have another decision ahead of you. The brand actually sells 26 different pressure multi-cookers across nine series, all with confusing names and different features\u2014so which one is best for you?\n\nTo help you decide, we've researched every Instant Pot available, from their budget offerings to their latest and greatest. Whether you're cooking for one or trying to feed a crowd, new to multi-cookers, like the idea of using a crockpot or yearn to be an electric pressure cooker pro, there's an option that's right for you.\n\nInstant Pot models we recommend\n\nThough we haven't tested them all in our own labs yet, here are the models we recommend based on our experience, user reviews, and the typical selling price online.\n\nDuo 7-in-1\n\nCredit: Sur La Table / Chelsea's Messy Apron\n\nThe most popular model of the Instant Pot to date is the Duo, a 7-in-1 cooker that can pressure cook, slow cook, make rice and yogurt, steam, warm and saute or brown meat and vegetables. Available in 3-, 6-, and 8-quart versions, the 6-quart is wildly popular and perfect for most people, with over 23,000 5-star reviews on Amazon.\n\nThe Duo is one of the most versitile kitchen appliances you'll ever use. It comes pre-programmed with 14 different settings, ranging from soup to poultry to porridge, while the manual setting lets you customize to suit your recipe. The device can pressure cook at both high and low pressures, which gives you the option to cook food very quickly or avoid overcooking delicate foods. It offers three temperatures for saute and slow cook, as well as an automatic keep warm function\u2014so don\u2019t worry about hovering around your kitchen trying to time your meal.\n\nThe Duo is popular, reliable, and perfect for most people, although it lacks some of the bells and whistles of more expensive models.\n\nIf you want a reliable, easy-to-use multi-cooker without some of the bells and whistles (i.e. cake and sterilize functions, internet connectivity) of more expensive models, consider the Duo. The 3-quart is great for solo cooks and the 8-quart will please big families, and regular sales on the 6-quart mean the price often dips below $80.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Duo 6-Qt. 7-in-1 Multi-cooker on Amazon for $89.99\n\nDuo Plus 9-in-1\n\nCredit: Williams Sonoma / Skinny Taste\n\nThe Duo Plus is, well, exactly what the names says\u2014the regular Duo, plus some more. This iteration also comes in three sizes and has all the standard features from the original model with the addition of \"Cake,\" \"Egg,\" and \"Sterilize\" settings.\n\nThe alarm clock aesthetic of the Duo\u2019s display has been updated to a blue LCD screen, which also shows icons that indicate selected settings. This model\u2019s inner bowl also comes with more comprehensive max/mill fill lines etched into the bowl for your benefit.\n\nIn general, the 9-in-1 Duo Plus affords users more customization and control than they have with the regular 7-in-1 Duo\u2014every program comes with three adjustable settings for desired doneness, and there are three temperatures in \"Keep Warm\" to maintain food at different serving temperatures. The \"Sterilize\" setting is also attractive for those who are particularly concerned about food safety and the parents of infants. For these reasons, the Duo Plus ranks high in our round-up of the best multi-cookers on the market.\n\nWith adjustable settings and and new programs, the 9-in-1 Duo Plus affords users more customization and control than they have with the regular 7-in-1 Duo.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who is very particular about their recipes or likes to experiment in the kitchen with new techniques, the Duo Plus will give you the freedom you desire. But if you\u2019re just looking for a basic Instant Pot, you can save quite a bit by going with the more popular 7-in-1 above.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Duo Plus 6-Qt. 9-in-1 Multi-cooker on Amazon for $119.95\n\nSmart WiFi\n\nCredit: Instant Pot / The Salty Marshmallow\n\nThe recently-released Smart WiFi, which has replaced the Smart Bluetooth, is an 8-in-1 appliance that shares most of its DNA with the Duo Plus, save for the latter\u2019s \"Sanitize\" function. The real update is the addition of long-awaited WiFi connectivity, allowing you to set, monitor, and control your multi-cooker from virtually anywhere. We absolutely adored the Smart WiFi in testing, making it our top choice for the best multi-cooker you can get on the market right now.\n\nThe real update is the addition of long-awaited WiFi connectivity, allowing you to set, monitor, and control your multi-cooker from virtually anywhere.\n\nIf you\u2019re not into micro-managing your dinner, the Smart WiFi also comes with 750+ pre-programmed recipes that simply let you press a button and forget about the meal until it's done. For now, it\u2019s only available in the 6-quart size.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Smart WiFi 6-Qt. Multi-cooker on Amazon for $119.99\n\nUltra 10-in-1\n\nCredit: Sur La Table\n\nAlthough the \u201cUltra\u201d is a line all its own, it\u2019s basically another step up from the Duo Plus\u2014the Plus Plus, if you will. If you\u2019re already familiar with pressure cooking and want the most that Instant Pot has to offer without WiFi connectivity, this is the device for you.\n\nThe Ultra comes with all presets available on the Duo Plus and adds one key player\u2014the \"Ultra\" program, which provides complete custom programming of temperature, pressure, time, and more. And with the \"Altitude\" adjustment, the guesswork is eliminated from recipe conversion to provide a more precise cooking time, regardless of location.\n\nOther useful bonus features include an indicator screen that shows you where you are in the cooking process, a sleek-looking dial, and a quick pressure release button.\n\nIf you\u2019re already familiar with pressure cooking and want the most that Instant Pot has to offer _without_ WiFi connectivity, the Ultra for you.\n\nThe Ultra has the same 4.5-star average rating on Amazon as the Duo, and although the MSRP is higher, it\u2019s occasionally on sale at a comparable price. If you\u2019re already familiar with pressure cooking or looking for the Mercedes of multi-cookers, the Ultra might be right for you\u2014but if you\u2019re overwhelmed by ten features (or really want to control your Instant Pot from afar), stick to the Duo or Smart.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Ultra 6-Qt. 10-in-1 Multi-cooker on Amazon for $119.95\n\nWhat do the different names and numbers mean?\n\nIf names like the IP-LUX60 V3 and IP-DUO Plus 9-in-1 have you scratching your head, you\u2019re not alone. The naming conventions for different Instant Pot models can be confusing, particularly if you\u2019re browsing online\u2014where every models looks almost identical and Amazon bombards you with three-line titles.\n\nTo help you interpret these names, let\u2019s look at the example of the IP-LUX60 6-in-1 V3. IP stands for Instant Pot (that one\u2019s easy), LUX is the series name, 60 refers to its volume (6 quarts), 6-in-1 lists the number of functions, and V3 means version 3.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to multi-cookers or just don\u2019t want to get into the nitty-gritty details of each product, focus on the volume and the the number of functions when you shop. If you live alone but like to experiment with different recipes, get a 3- or 6-quart model with lots of functions\u2014or if you tend to cook the same few things for a whole family, get an 8-quart model with fewer functions.\n\nSome listings will just say the series name and only list the number of functions in the description, and most listings will leave out the version name, which is when you can assume it\u2019s the latest version. While most series now come in 3-quart (often called Mini), 6-quart, and 8-quart sizes, some are only sold in one volume.\n\nThe name of each series won\u2019t mean much to you until you know what they all do, so we\u2019ve outlined them to help you make the right choice.\n\nInstant Pot models you should probably avoid\n\nDue to inflated prices, defunct technology, or poor reviews, we think you should steer clear of these models for now.\n\nMax\n\nCredit: Williams Sonoma\n\nAnnounced in early 2018, the Max was positioned to be the next big thing for Instant Pot. With 1,100 watts (compared with the traditional 1,000 watts) and the ability to reach 15psi, the Max promised higher pressure, faster cooking, as well as some wild new pre-sets (sous vide! canning!) and a touchscreen.\n\nUnfortunately, the Max hasn\u2019t been able to live up to its name. After a delayed release and middling-to-negative reviews from major players like CNET and Wired, the Max is finally available for pre-order\u2014but only on Williams Sonoma, with no trace to be found at Amazon and other major retailers.\n\nMany reviews cite the Max\u2019s inability to keep a consistent enough temperature for sous vide cooking, its lack of USDA certification for canning, and the fact it\u2019s only sold in the 6-quart size. Reviewed hasn\u2019t yet tested the Max, but we have plans to update our round-up of multi-cookers to include this model.\n\nBetween poor reviews and roll-out issues, the Max hasn\u2019t been able to live up to its name.\n\nFor $200, you\u2019d be better off buying the tried-and-true Ultra\u2014or saving your cash for when Instant Pot works out the kinks in the Max.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Ultra 6-Qt. 10-in-1 Multi-cooker on Amazon for $199.95\n\nSmart Bluetooth\n\nCredit: Jo Cooks / Instant Pot\n\nThe Instant Pot Smart Bluetooth has all the functionality of the 6-quart Duo, plus Bluetooth connectivity for setting and monitoring your appliance from afar. So why shouldn\u2019t you buy one? Instant Pot is phasing out of the Bluetooth version in favor of WiFi\u2014making this model defunct and wildly expensive where available.\n\nOnce sold for around $250, the price has ballooned up to about $600 from resellers looking to make a buck from those who are desperate or simply don\u2019t know better. If you find a Smart Bluetooth for under $250, we can\u2019t stop you from purchasing it\u2014but know that the compatible app probably won\u2019t be seeing any maintenance or updates anytime soon.\n\nInstant Pot is phasing out of the Bluetooth version in favor of WiFi\u2014making this model defunct and wildly expensive where available.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the convenience of a Smart multi-cooker, check out the recently released Instant Pot Smart WiFi instead.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Smart Bluetooth 6-Qt.

While it features the \"Cake\" and \"Egg\" programs from the Duo Plus, it lacks \"Bean/Chili,\" \"Poultry,\" and \"Yogurt\" settings, as well as an option to cook at low pressure (although it still has the ability to pressure cook at high pressure). It also forgoes some of the accessories found on other models, like a condensation collector and cord rack.\n\nUnlike some of the speciality Instant Pot models, the Lux also comes in 3-, 6- and 8-quart sizes. While we prefer the Duo series, the Lux is still great at what it does and a solid option for those looking for a straightforward multi-cooker.\n\nThe Lux is Instant Pot\u2019s popular base model, offering the fewest bells and whistles of all their pressure multi-cookers.\n\nWhen it comes to price, keep in mind that this model usually costs around $79 online, but it rarely goes on sale. While the Duo usually sells for $100, it\u2019s frequently on sale for as low as $69\u2014so if you're willing to wait for a deal, the Duo may be cheaper in the end.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Lux 6-in-1 6-Qt.

USA TODAY\u2019s Jefferson Graham breaks down the best cable alternatives on Talking Tech. USA TODAY\n\nMany of us have been there. You realize you're paying too much every month on various TV subscription services and want to cut back. So you turn on the TV, open the app, go to the account settings and search in vain for the \"cancel\" tab.\n\nOnly it's not there.\n\nSigning up for a free trial is simple, but stopping the automatic billing spigot can take some detective work. It will require going to your computer, opening an app or calling in and standing firm with the rep who doesn't want to break up.\n\nNetflix, Amazon, Hulu, DirecTV Now, SlingTV, Sony PlayStation VUE, Philo, CBS All Access and others all offer the ability to ditch cable for internet-based entertainment that doesn't require a contract or equipment rental and offers more ways to watch \u2013 on TV, phones, tablets and computers.\n\nMore: Netflix raises monthly prices on all of its US plans; here\u2019s how much you\u2019ll pay\n\nMore: Cutting the cord? We grade your cable alternatives\n\nWith so many offerings comes an ever-growing monthly bill, and there are more new subscription services in the wings: Disney, Warner Media, Apple and NBC Universal have services slated to debut this year.\n\nSo how do you get out? DirecTV Now notes on its website: \"You can only cancel your service using a computer\u2019s web browser.\" But each service has different policies.\n\nConsider how you registered\n\nA wrinkle to leaving the membership is how you registered in the first place. If you signed up via Apple's iTunes, Google Play, Roku or Amazon, instead of directly with the company, you've got more sleuthing work ahead of you as you'll need to go to the provider and cancel there.\n\nStreaming companies are trying to encourage signing up for multiple subscriptions at one place, to ease up on the load of checking many different bills. Roku announced earlier this month that it will let users subscribe to premium channels within their Roku account and the Roku app. Consumers, in turn, get to watch the channels outside of the home, via the app.\n\nOrdering this way is even simpler than by going direct because Amazon, Roku, and the rest have your credit card and personal information already.\n\nHere's a look at how to cancel some of the major streaming services:\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix announced a major price hike last week, effective immediately for new subscribers, which will be rolled out to current subscribers in the coming months. That could lead some users to cancel or downgrade their services.\n\nGo to your Netflix account on the computer, look for the Cancel Membership button and click. That's easy.\n\nBut if you signed up via iTunes, you'll need to go to Settings on the iPhone > iTunes & App Stores > Apple ID > View Apple ID > type in your password, scroll to the bottom and click Subscriptions, where you will find a list. Once there, you can edit your subscription and click the cancel button.\n\nNetflix announced at the end of 2018 that it would no longer sign up new subscribers via iTunes but would continue to host current members there.\n\nWhere your subscriptions are held in iTunes (Photo: Screenshot)\n\nHulu\n\nThe streamer sends members to the Account page, where you select Update next to your name in the Personal Info section. From there, you \"delete\" the account. Hulu also accepts signups via Amazon and Roku but still directs consumers to the Hulu account page to cancel. For members subscribing via iTunes or Spotify, you need to cancel from there.\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nTo cancel an app like HBO or Starz, or even a homegrown service like Amazon Music, go to the account settings, membership and subscriptions and look for the app you ordered. Once you find \"cancel,\" you'll be asked several times to confirm that you really no longer want to subscribe.\n\nRoku\n\nThe streamer will let you do this from the TV. To cancel, press the home button on the Roku remote, Press the Home button on your Roku remote, go to the Channel Store, find the channel you want to eliminate, select Manage subscription and cancel.\n\nGoogle Play\n\nGo to your Google Play account subscriptions, click manage on the app you want to get rid of and confirm the cancellation.\n\nSteps to sign up for for a subscription on Amazon (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nThe old-fashioned method: phone\n\nI ordered CBS All Access via iTunes, specifically to watch the second season of \"The Good Fight,\" the sequel to \"The Good Wife.\" Thirteen episodes later, there's no reason to continue paying anymore.\n\nThe TV had no options for getting out, and the website was confusing. So I was left with no option but to call in.\n\nAfter dialing, I was asked to click 1 if I ordered with Roku, 2 with iTunes, 3 with Google Play, etc. I didn't remember how I signed up.\n\n\"Can I ask you why you are canceling?\" asked the rep.\n\n\"I pay too much money monthly and am cutting back.\"\n\n\"But what about the shows you're giving up? You get four live TV stations, 10,000 shows, The Good Fight, Star Trek....\"\n\nI cut the rep off, and he agreed to let me out. I gave him my e-mail address, and he deduced that I had signed up with iTunes. He unsubscribed me, then urged me to register again, under a different e-mail, at CBS.com, and said he would throw in a free month's service if I did.\n\nMaybe later in the year, when the Good Fight comes back for season 3. But for now, I'm happy eliminating yet another monthly fee.\n\nReaders: What's the worst experience you've had canceling your monthly subscription? We'd love to hear all about it.

If you're like most people, you have a few favorites you use all the time, and the rest stay hanging on the pot rack or piled in the cupboard. But whether you prefer your go-tos because they're the perfect size or they\u2019re well-seasoned or just flat-out pretty, they won't last you forever if you don't take care of them.\n\nWhile (most) cookware is a lot more durable than, say, that cashmere sweater you got for Christmas, kitchen essentials still need some love and care to keep them functioning and looking great for years to come. Even the best cookware, best Dutch ovens, and best cast-iron pans we\u2019ve tested need maintenance.\n\nHere are some simple steps to take to help your pots and pans last:\n\n1. Treat burned-on stains as soon as they happen\n\nCredit: Getty / s-cphoto\n\nWe've all been there: you\u2019re in the middle of making dinner and you step away from the stove for a moment. When you return, something very ugly has happened\u2014your food is all scorched up, and with it your pan.\n\nWhile this might send you into a panic, don\u2019t just dump your food and start cooking again in a different vessel. Instead, focus on treating your cookware then and there.\n\nNo matter the type of cookware, soap, water, and the scrubbing side of a sponge should be your first line of defense\u2014yes, even on cast-iron. But if that isn\u2019t enough to remove caked-on food or burnt spots, you need to move onto other solutions.\n\nCredit: Getty / Willopix\n\nStainless steel, copper, and enamelware: Try filling the pan with a solution of one part vinegar and three parts water, and bring it all to a boil. This should go a long way toward removing stains, and if you\u2019re satisfied you can let the pan cool and then wash it with soap and water. If things still look pretty rough in there, you can remove the pan from the heat and add a tablespoon or two of baking soda. Then, pour out the solution and wash the pan as usual.\n\nStill seeing dark spots? You should break out a container of Bar Keepers Friend. This non-bleach chemical cleanser can be a godsend when you just want your pots and pans to shine like new. Make a paste with a small amount of water and some of the powder in the bottom of your pan, and the scrub vigorously until stains are gone. If you prefer an all-natural product, try Bon Ami.\n\nCredit: Amazon\n\nBar Keepers Friend works great for when you\u2019ve scorched the exterior of your cookware, too. It\u2019s brought my Dutch oven back to life multiple times\u2014and those bad boys are too expensive to not treat properly.\n\nCast-iron and nonstick: While it\u2019s harder to really burn these pans because of their non-stick properties, you need to be gentle when treating any stuck-on food that happens. Rather than a chemical abrasive, use any coarse salt and a paper towel\u2014or baking soda and a sponge\u2014to gently scrub the inside and remove any debris. Make sure to re-season your pan after any real scrubbing.\n\nIf you don\u2019t treat your cookware as soon as burns happen, the stains will be harder to get out\u2014but you can use the same methods above (with a little more elbow-grease) to treat old stains, too.\n\n2. Season your cast-iron\u2014and your nonstick\n\nCredit: Getty / zeljkosantrac\n\nYou heard me\u2014you probably already know that you need to re-season your cast-iron pans to prevent rusting and preserve its non-stick properties, but seasoning your nonstick cookware can go a long way in maintaining its nonstick finish. It even says so on the label.\n\nIf your nonstick cookware is ceramic, you can skip this step. Otherwise, try pouring a small amount of oil on a paper towel and rubbing the inside of the pan after each use. Unlike cast iron, nonstick coating can\u2019t withstand extremely high heat, so don't heat the pan after oiling it. Simply rubbing it in will do enough, combined regular use and careful cleaning.\n\nConfused about how to take care of your cast-iron? The cast-iron guide over at Serious Eats will tell you all you need to know. Essentially, wash and dry thoroughly, season regularly, and keep a look-out for any rust spots. If you\u2019re in the market for a new pan, check out our ranking of the best cast-iron pans.\n\n3. Use the right utensils\n\nCredit: Getty / Martin Barraud\n\nWhile you can use metal tongs, spoons, and spatulas on cast-iron and stainless steel all you want, you shouldn\u2019t be using them with nonstick surfaces. If you want your nonstick cookware to last, you should be careful not to damage the surface with these kinds of tools.\n\nWe recommend using wooden spoons or soft silicone spatulas with nonstick cookware to avoid scratching or gouging the surface. And you may find that spatulas and other tools aren't even that necessary: since nonstick cookware has such a slick surface, you can simply tip the pan to plate your food.\n\n4. Wash, dry, and store with care\n\nCredit: Getty / gilaxia\n\nI regularly argue with my boyfriend about putting pots and pans and the dishwasher, but here\u2019s what the science says\u2014handwashing is always best for longevity. While you can put your stainless steel cookware in the dishwasher if you\u2019re really feeling lazy, NEVER put cast-iron or nonstick in there, because the washer\u2019s high heat and pressure will damage the cooking surface.\n\nWe recommend that enamelware should be hand-washed, too, because it\u2019s susceptible to chipping\u2014and a heavy Dutch oven is likely to rattle around and break delicate things like plates and glasses. That being said, manufacturers like Le Creuset have their own guidelines about dishwasher use\u2014and, if you're looking for permission to load everything in your dishwasher, you may like their answers.\n\nWhen your pots and pans are clean and ready to go back where they belong, make sure they\u2019re completely dry (water can rust a cast-iron easily) before stacking or hanging them up. If you do stack your cookware, try to stack them by type so that heavier pans, like cast-iron and stainless steel, don\u2019t scratch your more delicate nonstick pans.\n\nIt\u2019s best to layer pans with cloth or paper towel to prevent scratches and thunderous clanging that will wake your kids, roommates, or spouse. Another tip? Use a pot lid organizer, like this best-selling organizer from Amazon, if you don\u2019t already. It will really keep your cupboard a lot neater.\n\n5. Don\u2019t treat every pan the same\n\nCredit: Getty / rudisill\n\nEvery type of cookware is different, with special quirks and rules and advantages and disadvantages. To take care of each properly, make sure you know what you\u2019re working with! We\u2019ve already assembled handy guides on how to care for stainless steel, how to care for nonstick, and how to care for cast-iron, so be sure to reference those if you still have questions.\n\nUnfortunately, not every old pot and pan can be salvaged from ruin. If your cookware's non-stick coating is peeling away, enamel is chipping, or its base is warped or cracked or permanently blackened, it's time to replace them. And if you invest in some good cookware and take good care of it, your returns will be delicious for years to come.\n\nMore articles you might enjoy"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/world/2019/02/21/why-do-zebras-have-stripes-scientists-dress-up-horses-find-out/39090841/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/21/nike-smart-sneakers-experience-pairing-issues-days-after-release/2936414002/", "text": "Sometimes, seemingly promising futuristic products don't launch without a hitch.

USA TODAY\n\nCatholic school students in Trump hats. A Native American elder beating a drum. Black Hebrew Israelites hurling bigotry.\n\nThis chance encounter on the National Mall that winter afternoon blew up into a near perfect storm fed by the kinds of divisive social issues roiling the nation.\n\nLiberals and conservatives alike saw what they wanted to see in videos captured on smartphones at the scene. It seemed as if everyone with a Twitter account had an instant opinion as the first video clip, reflecting only a brief portion of the Jan. 18 encounter, raced across the world.\n\nIn the aftermath, USA TODAY analyzed more than 3 million tweets and thousands of public posts on Facebook, from the moments after the video of Covington Catholic students' encounter with Native American activist Nathan Phillips was posted to President Donald Trump's tweets days later.\n\nThe volume and velocity provide an illuminating example of how social media and the news media can be exploited to fuel outrage in a deeply divided country, even as the full picture of an event is still forming.\n\nAll it took was a nudge from a few suspicious accounts on Facebook and Twitter. Partisan fervor mixed with high emotions did the rest.\n\nNearly 24 hours after the first published story, more than 30,000 tweets an hour mentioned Covington.\n\nMore: What to know about Black Hebrew Israelites\n\nTweet after tweet fed the outrage machine, swiftly condemning the students, who appeared to critics to have surrounded and mocked Phillips at an Indigenous Peoples March in Washington, D.C. Then media coverage began to accelerate. Among the students who were attending a March for Life anti-abortion rally in the capital, Nick Sandmann was singled out for the way he smiled at Phillips as the two stood face to face. Religion scholar Reza Aslan wrote on Twitter: \"Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid\u2019s?\u201d\n\nFinger-wagging from millions of strangers quickly escalated to threats. \"Name these kids,\" comedian Kathy Griffin demanded of her 2 million followers. \"I want NAMES.\" A film producer tweeted \u2013 then deleted \u2013 a scene from the movie Fargo: \"#MAGAkids go screaming, hats first, into the woodchipper.\"\n\nEven after a longer video emerged showing that the confrontation began after a group known as the Black Hebrew Israelites targeted the boys and began yelling insults at them, which Sandmann called \"hateful things,\" no one could agree on what happened. A month later, they still haven't.\n\nAn investigation conducted on behalf of the Diocese of Covington concluded last week that the students did not instigate the incident and made no \"offensive or racist statements,\" though the report acknowledged some students made a \"tomahawk chop\" gesture. The investigation determined, as did reporting by some news outlets, that Phillips had approached the students as they exchanged words with the Black Hebrew Israelites, contradicting what he first said when describing the standoff. Phillips said he stepped between the students and the Black Hebrew Israelites to defuse the \"volatile\" situation. But fuller video of the entire encounter shows Phillips walk past the Black Hebrew Israelites and up to the students.\n\nPhillips, a member of the Omaha tribe, responded to the school's report by saying the students were disrespectful: \"I ask everybody to remember what we all saw \u2013 students performing a culturally appropriated \u2018school chant\u2019 and the tomahawk chop just feet away from me on that fateful day.\"\n\nLance Soto, an indigenous leader from Covington, told the Cincinnati Enquirer: \"I hope that our people realize that it\u2019s not up to white people to determine what is racist or derogatory toward Native Americans.\"\n\nBishop Rev. Roger Foys of the Diocese of Covington argued the reaction from the students on the National Mall was expected and \"one might say even laudatory.\"\n\n\"The immediate world-wide reaction to the initial video led almost everyone to believe that our students had initiated the incident and the perception of those few minutes of video became reality,\" Foys said in a letter sent to parents last week. \"In truth ... our students were placed in a situation that was at once bizarre and even threatening.\"\n\nThe ease with which political divisions can be exploited on social media and are then amplified by the news media is a lesson for our time, says Klon Kitchen, senior research fellow for technology, national security and science policy at the Heritage Foundation. But, Kitchen says, the real problem is us.\n\n\"We are building thick bubbles of information around ourselves, where it's always self-reinforcing, where we are losing any kind of perspective on alternative views and where we are very excited about participating in the public takedown of people's reputations,\" he says. \"It's not the only time we've seen this and it won't be the last.\"\n\nThe evolution of a controversy\n\nThe controversy began when observers, such as college student Kaya Taitano, pulled out their phones to film the encounter on the National Mall. But its viral spread points to the little-noticed role that social media accounts of unknown origins can play in weaving inflammatory content into timelines and news feeds.\n\nTaitano attended the Indigenous Peoples March and told the Guam Daily Post that Phillips was chanting and described his actions as cleansing the negative energy in the area. The one-minute video clip she posted on Instagram, showing a close-up of Sandmann and Phillips, quickly drew attention. \"The amount of disrespect.... TO THIS DAY,\" Taitano wrote hours after the incident.\n\n\"Those kids were so lucky that elder stepped in,\" Taitano said.\n\nVideo of the confrontation was spotted by @2020fight, a Twitter account with 41,000 followers using the name \"Talia,\" which added a message that, within hours, triggered an explosive political moment: \u201cThis MAGA loser gleefully bothering a Native American protestor at the Indigenous Peoples March.\u201d Twitter later determined that @2020fight was a suspicious account, but the message spread.\n\nBoom. First liberal activists expressed outrage, then celebrities, commentators and journalists. The clip quickly had more than 10 million views and 28,000 retweets. By early morning Jan. 19, people were being drawn into the online squabble by the thousands.\n\nTwitter eventually suspended @2020fight for \"deliberate attempts to manipulate the public conversation on Twitter by using misleading account information\" after CNN Business raised suspicions about it. The account was then reactivated and NBC News reported that a teacher likely ran the account, which the person later deleted. Twitter did not explain why it reactivated the account.\n\nBut the video was being spread by other Twitter accounts and was gaining traction on Facebook, too, where pages seemingly run by activists raced to share it.\n\nAbout 2 a.m. on Jan. 19, well before the story went viral, a Facebook page called REAL Mexican Problems posted it, attracting more than 1.5 million views and nearly 22,000 shares. \"This is Amerikkkan arrogance at its worst,\" the post read.\n\nThe page, created in 2013, often shares indigenous themes and memes and describes its mission as \"abolishing white supremacy!\" But the only contact information for the page is a phone number for the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. An inquiry from USA TODAY prompted Facebook to investigate the page.\n\nWhoever lit the spark, the firestorm raged on its own.\n\nDominating news feeds\n\nAngela Beers, a psychologist from the indigenous community in Detroit who was unable to attend the march in Washington, spotted the video and wrote a Facebook post to defend her friend against a growing barrage of criticism.\n\n\"Despite what a lot of people seemed to be confused about, Nathan offered prayers to this individual in a situation that could have been much worse. Nathan's act of compassion was made to look like an act of instigation,\" she said. \"The situation was defused. Everyone went home. There were no arrests. There was no bloodshed. He did the right thing.\"\n\nAmanda Blackhorse, an activist from Phoenix, attended the Indigenous Peoples March but left before the incident. The next morning, a friend flagged the video. \"I was just like so shocked,\" she said. \"I immediately shared it.\"\n\nHer post received nearly 500,000 video views and was shared about 6,000 times, including by a Facebook group with more than 70,000 members: I Acknowledge A War On Women Exists. \"When I posted, I didn't realize it was going to turn into the thing it turned into,\" said Danielle Barnhart, a New York woman who shared the post to the group.\n\nJames Reader, who created the page about three years ago and used to run a page called Reverb Press that Facebook shut down last year, says conservatives and liberals on Facebook routinely work to quash stories that don't fit their views and boost those that do.\n\n\"The game is to try to dominate people's news feeds,\" he said. \"We most definitely want to influence the way mainstream media covers stories and events.\"\n\nAnd that's seemingly what happened by the time local and national media picked up the story.\n\nThe River City News, which covers the city of Covington, posted a story on Facebook at 10:50 a.m. the day after the march with the headline \"Video Appears to Show Covington Catholic Students Swarming Native American Marcher.\" The Cincinnati Enquirer, a USA TODAY Network newspaper, also picked up the story about an hour later, citing the video and published a story with the headline \"Covington Catholic faces backlash over video.\u201d By the time national news outlets, including USA TODAY, began reporting on the story, the video had potentially reached millions.\n\nThe parents of one teen who was mistakenly identified by the angry mob on Twitter were harassed at a family wedding. A Colorado teacher was placed on leave after misidentifying another teen, accusing him of training with \"Hitler youth.\"\n\nMore video footage surfaced two days after the incident and, just as quickly as the story spread, so too did questions about what really happened. Media, including USA TODAY, followed up the initial coverage with stories and social media posts that focused on the revelations in the longer video, and pursued other developments.\n\nThe political winds shifted sharply. Now conservatives were raging against those who had rushed to denounce the Covington Catholic teens.\n\nAn enemies list #VerifiedBullies was crafted to out liberals who had behaved badly. Conservatives rallied around the hashtag #StandWithCovington. Trump weighed in twice on Twitter, saying the kids were \"smeared\" by the media.\n\nChastened, some who criticized the students apologized or deleted their social media posts. That included Hollywood producer Jack Morrissey, who deleted his tweet about the woodchipper comment and told The Wrap: \u201cIt was just a fast, profoundly stupid tweet.\"\n\nThis week USA TODAY reviewed and deleted a Twitter post that cited language from a story: \"The crowd of students, some of whom wore MAGA caps, mocked Native Americans while chanting 'Build the Wall' and using derogatory language.\" The post was removed today because the underlying events have been disputed as additional video has surfaced and the description should have been attributed to Phillips as his view.\n\nThree days after the encounter, the conservative backlash had reached a fever pitch. Fox News' Todd Starnes lashed out at news reporters, calling them \"thugs with press passes\" who had intentionally endangered young people with reckless coverage \"simply because they were wearing #MAGA hats.\" Julie Irwin Zimmerman, a Cincinnati writer, wrote a mea culpa in The Atlantic: \"I Failed the Covington Catholic Test.\"\n\nThreats made against the students by public figures \u2013 and Twitter's failure to remove them \u2013 continued to inflame the political right. Hundreds of social media posts were reported to law enforcement in addition to direct threats against students, parents and the school.\n\n'Cultural crisis'\n\nWeeks later, the national fury has died down, but the embers still glow.\n\nMany on the political left still defend their initial take after seeing the footage of Phillips on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. USA TODAY reached out to Griffin and Aslan to see if they stood by their tweets. Neither responded.\n\nSoto, a member of the Cocopah tribe and leader within the Indiana and Kentucky chapter of the American Indian Movement, told the Cincinnati Enquirer last week that the local American Indian Movement chapter has called for a public apology to Phillips and new curriculum on Native American history. The chapter also wants all Covington Catholic staff who accompanied the teens to Washington, D.C., to be fired.\n\n\"I saw young men mocking and disrespecting an elder,\" Soto said, \"and it made me sad to think about how much work we have to do locally in order for our Native Americans to be recognized as actual human beings.\"\n\nLawyers representing Sandmann and his family told the Cincinnati Enquirer they are preparing for possible libel and defamation lawsuits. Just this week, Sandmann\u2019s lawyers announced they were suing The Washington Post for $250 million, saying the newspaper's coverage \u201cattacked, vilified, and threatened Nicholas Sandmann.\"\n\nPropelled by the speed of the Twitter bullhorn and the news cycle, this polarization is only getting more extreme, says Whitney Phillips, assistant professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University.\n\nThat a few taps on a screen can cause so much strife and chaos speaks more to the current cultural crisis in the United States than the state of media or social media, she says.\n\n\"It's not so much that America is being manipulated. It's America being harnessed,\" Whitney Phillips said. \"You identify a pile of kindling and then you direct your accelerant there. But the kindling has to be there first in order for these campaigns to work.\"\n\nMore: Columnist Kirsten Powers: I'm not proud of the role I've played in toxic debate.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/02/19/covington-catholic-outrage-spread-shady-facebook-and-twitter-posts/2667213002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/tech/2019/02/21/why-tvs-now-so-cheap/2923480002/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/20/what-you-need-know-israels-lunar-lander-spacex-rocket-launch/2930704002/", "text": "CLOSE A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches the Air Force's GPS III satellite from Cape Canaveral on Sunday, Dec. 23, 2018.

USA TODAY\n\nFollowing Amazon's decision to cancel plans for a second headquarters in New York City, other cities are making public attempts to get a slice of the tech giant pie.\n\nLast week, Amazon said it will no longer pursue its HQ2 in New York amid local political opposition. The move came after reports that Amazon was re-evaluating its decision last year to put one of its two new headquarters in Long Island City in Queens.\n\nThe huge online retailer said in a statement that it did \"not intend to reopen the HQ2 search at this time.\" But that hasn't stopped cities and states from giving an old college try when it comes to courting Amazon.\n\nBelow is a list of some of the areas that have reached out to Amazon regarding relocation of its second headquarters.\n\nBlame game: Politicians squabble over who is to blame for Amazon decision to ditch New York\n\nOpinion: New York's Amazon rejection exposes US opportunity gap and Democrats' political disconnect\n\nAmazon logo. (Photo: David Ryder / Getty Images)\n\nNewark, New Jersey\n\nAs one of the 20 finalists for Amazon's HQ2, Newark has received a lot of attention following Amazon's cancellation plans. Both Newark and New Jersey officials have issued statements regarding potential investment from the tech giant.\n\n\u201cAfter learning of the decision to pull out of their chosen HQ2 location, I contacted Amazon and city of Newark stakeholders directly, continuing a constant dialogue that predates my time as governor,\" Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement to NorthJersey.com. \"New Jersey is open for business, and now more than ever, Newark is the clear choice as the next presence for Amazon corporate offices. Amazon now has the opportunity to join in Newark\u2019s story of a city on the rise.\u201d\n\nWith the headquarters for Audible, an Amazon company, in Newark, some have argued that the city would make a good location for Amazon to establish a hub. Mayor Ras Baraka said that his community \"has been, and will continue to be, engaged\" with Amazon.\n\n\u201cGiven the city and state\u2019s assets \u2013 a strong talent pipeline, a diverse tech base, unmatched infrastructure and a highly accessible location \u2013 we are well poised to accommodate Amazon should they want to relocate New York City\u2019s portion of HQ2, in whole or part,\" Baraka told NorthJersey.com.\n\nBakara's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMiami\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

Mayor Carlos Gimenez used the news of the company's decision to pull out of New York City as an opportunity to re-pitch South Florida as a viable headquarter destination.\n\n\u201cI understand that Amazon has decided not to pursue an additional headquarters at this time,\u201d Gimenez wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. \u201cHowever, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take this opportunity to reopen the lines of communication because Miami, without a doubt, has the talent, technology and low taxes to serve Amazon\u2019s needs.\"\n\nGimenez also invited Bezos and Amazon to come back down to Miami \"to discuss how Amazon and Miami can continue to grow together,\" he wrote in the letter.\n\nGimenez's office declined to make an additional comment beyond the letter.\n\nA view of the waterfront of Long Island City in the Queens borough of New York, along the East River, is seen Nov. 7, 2018.

Pritzker jumped at the chance to try to persuade Amazon, writing a letter to the company on why it should reconsider Chicago.\n\n\"You should take another look at Chicago,\u201d the letter obtained by the Chicago Tribune said. \u201cWe will be happy to bring you back.\u201d\n\nEmanuel's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWarren, Michigan\n\nWarrenwas not a finalist for Amazon's HQ2 search process \u2013 but that didn't stop Mayor Jim Fouts from reaching out to the tech giant.\n\nAfter watching the news of Amazon's decision to pull out of New York City, Fouts had \"off-the-cuff inspiration\" to write the company a letter.\n\n\"If you're going to move out of New York City, and that means they can go anywhere ... I said, 'why not Warren?'\" Fouts told USA TODAY. \"So I got on my Facebook and wrote down why I thought Warren would be good.\"\n\nFouts tried to persuade Amazon with several of Warren's attributes, such as a population of highly skilled workers who have been laid off by General Motors or attracting the Cadillac world headquarters to move there.\n\n\"Amazon, please consider dynamic Warren as your headquarters!\" Fouts wrote. \"You will not be disappointed!\"\n\nWest Palm Beach, Florida\n\nWest Palm Beach had originally submitted a joint bid for Amazon's HQ2 with Miami and Broward County. Outside of appealing to Amazon, West Palm Beach has been conducting a campaign in the northeast to attract businesses to the area, according to Mayor Jeri Muoio.\n\nMuoio said that she wrote a letter to Bezos to \"remind him that we're here, and we have a lot of great things to offer,\" she told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Recently dubbed 'The Wall Street of the South' by Newsweek, West Palm Beach has been quietly attracting businesses from New York City and the Northeast over the last few years,\" the letter reads.\n\nMuoio told USA TODAY she wrote the letter to \"tell people that West Palm Beach is a great place to do business.\"\n\nLocalities in New York\n\nDespite New York City losing Amazon, other parts of the state have reached out to the tech giant.\n\nRockland County Executive Ed Day wrote a joint letter along with the Town of Haverstraw, the Town of Orangetown, the Town of Ramapo and the Village of Suffern to Bezos to express interest.\n\n\"We are confident that we can offer all that is needed by Amazon; including airports in adjoining counties, a business-friendly environment and a multitude of transportation and infrastructure options,\" the letter reads. \"We previously applied as part of your HQ2 selection process and feel we offer a 'Prime' location near New York City but with room for development.\n\nThough Day is aware that Amazon has stated it will not be selecting a new location for HQ2, \"we have also seen just how quickly plans can change,\" John Lyon, Day's spokesperson, told USA TODAY.\n\nRochester, also plans to try to impress Amazon. In 2017, Rochester submitted a joint application with Buffalo to become the destination for Amazon's HQ2.\n\n\"We are going to try our best to make a second pitch,\" Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.\n\nWarren's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCLOSE New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has slammed Amazon for pulling the plug on plans to set up a headquarters in the city, saying the decision caught him by surprise.

Buzz60's Maria Mercedes Galuppo has more. Buzz60\n\nTampa, Florida, police say a viral Facebook post about an Uber ride and a possible sex trafficking attempt is a simple misunderstanding.\n\nA woman arriving at Tampa International Airport posted on Facebook on Tuesday that she had gotten into the wrong car at the airport and eventually was concerned her driver was involved in sex trafficking.\n\nDuring the ride, the passenger, whose name is listed as Emmy Hurley on Facebook, noticed that she did not recognize where she was going and brought it to the attention of the driver, police say. There was some confusion between the passenger and the driver, who police said spoke Spanish as her primary language.\n\nThen, the passenger got a call from the Uber driver who was supposed to pick her up and was still at airport. The second driver suggested she get out if she was concerned, which she did while the car was still moving, according to the Facebook post, which has been shared more than 351,000 times.\n\nSmartphone survey: Forget 5G and foldable. We just want battery to last all day\n\nSocial media: How a few shady posts fed a viral firestorm over Covington Catholic\n\nThe woman also said on Facebook that she found out that the initial driver \"is a sex traffic worker.\"\n\nBut Tampa police say that is not the case.\n\n\"There is no evidence to support the woman\u2019s statement posted on social media that she later 'found out she is a sex traffic worker',\" the Tampa Police Department said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nDuring the incident, either the passenger or the second driver brought up that they had heard sex traffickers use Uber to lure people in, police say.\n\n\"The driver of the car in question is a legitimate Uber driver who was at the airport to pick up someone else,\" police said in the statement. \"The language barrier, and the fact that the woman got into the wrong car, led to confusion. Unfortunately, that also led to inaccurate conclusions that were then posted on social media.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Uber has been hit with erroneous reports of drivers being involved in sex trafficking. Last month, the Cambridge (Massachusetts) Police Department publicly denied such an investigation after text messages involving ride-share services were circulating after police made an arrest in a kidnapping case.\n\nUber, which has trained its drivers in cities to identify potential human trafficking situations, said in a statement to USA TODAY: \"We encourage riders to use the driver, car and license plate information they receive in the app to verify they are getting into the right vehicle. We\u2019ve been in touch with the driver, rider and local law enforcement to clarify the misinformation that has been circulating.\u201d\n\nThe woman who posted about the incident on Facebook also didn't return a request for comment.\n\nPolice did note that the woman at the center of the incident did end her Facebook post 'with an appropriate word of caution: 'Always, always check your Uber.' \"\n\n\n\nOther tips from the Tampa Police Department:\n\n\u2022 Make sure you get into the right car. Check the ride-sharing app for the license plate number and the model of car.\n\n\u2022 Check the name of the driver and make sure the driver looks like their photo in the app.\n\n\u2022 Before you enter the car, ask the driver who he or she is there to pick up. Since the app provides the driver with your name, they should be able to answer.\n\n\u2022 Always sit in the back seat, so you can make a quick exit if you need to.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2019/02/20/uber-tampa-airport-post-emmy-hurley-misunderstanding-police/2927798002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/20/5-g-foldable-phone-better-battery-what-you-want-from-your-next-smartphone/2883789002/", "text": "CLOSE Cellular technology is about to make an evolutionary leap. 5G is almost here. But you're gonna have to wait a little longer. Here's why. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs\n\nFoldable phones, 5G and other hyped features aren't going to motivate most of you to buy a new smartphone.\n\nYou\u2019re driven by something more basic \u2013 like a phone battery that\u2019ll last a full day and beyond.\n\nThese are key takeaways from a survey of 1,303 smartphone buyers in the U.S., conducted this month on USA TODAY\u2019S behalf by SurveyMonkey Audience.\n\nConsider that 2 out of 3 smartphone owners have heard of the blazing fast \u201c5G\u201d wireless networks that are only now starting to emerge. Nearly half have at least a passing familiarity with \u201cfoldable\u201d or flexible-screen devices that are supposed to herald the next wave of smartphone innovation, including a model that Samsung is expected to formally flaunt (if not yet release) at a press event on Wednesday in San Francisco marking the 10th anniversary of the company\u2019s flagship Galaxy S phone line.\n\nVisitors test the Galaxy S9 at the 2018 IFA consumer electronics and home appliances trade fair in Berlin, August 30, 2018. (Photo: Michele Tantussi, Getty Images)\n\nAnd yet for Samsung and other phone makers all gung-ho on exploiting 5G and flexible design hardware in 2019, familiarity doesn\u2019t mean such features rank high on consumer wish lists, at least if those would-be mobile buyers have to spend a small fortune to get them.\n\nInstead, folks want what they\u2019ve always wanted, notably that extra juice and a handset that takes good pictures. Even at that, consumers can live without multiple camera lenses or fancy augmented reality stunts.\n\nWhat Samsung has coming: Foldable phone, 5G, Galaxy S10: Breaking down the rumors ahead of Samsung's Unpacked event\n\nApple foldable?: Foldable wars? New patent filing suggests that Apple is readying a 'foldable' iPhone\n\nNext for Apple: Ready for more Apple? Report details AirPods, Macs, iPhones, iPod Touch updates for 2019\n\nIndeed, 76 percent of iPhone owners and 77 percent of Android users listed longer battery life as something that will get them excited about buying a new phone. Fifty-seven percent and 52 percent, respectively, said a better camera would do it..\n\nBut only 37 percent and 40 percent pointed to 5G as a reason to get jazzed, 34 percent and 31 percent indicated a bigger screen would do the trick, and just 17 percent and 19 percent said a flexible design that morphs from phone to tablet is what they\u2019re after.\n\nMeanwhile, smaller screen phones or devices built around throwback or nostalgic designs barely registered in the survey.\n\nBetter, not newer\n\n\u201cSmartphone consumers have gotten into the habit of upgrading their phone every couple of years, so they pretty much know what to expect,\u201d says Laura Wronski, senior research scientist, at SurveyMonkey, and the person who ran the study. \u201cTheir new phone will be a bigger, better, faster version of their old phone. They aren\u2019t looking for their phone to suddenly turn into a virtual reality device or to have all these extra bells and whistles. They want an improvement on what they have.\u201d\n\nOne thing evident from the survey is that iPhone and Android owners are locked in, with around 90 percent in each group planning to stick with their current operating system even if they splurge on a new phone. (Nearly 54 percent of the Android respondents have Samsung phones.)\n\nA photograph is displayed on a iPhone XS Max during an event to announce new products at Apple Headquarters Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2018, in Cupertino, Calif. (Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, AP)\n\nBoth groups are equally likely to say they\u2019ll upgrade their phones when new models are released (43 percent and 42 percent, respectively). iPhone owners would appear to be more overdue for an upgrade if only because 40 percent of them have held their current handset for more than two years, compared to only 21 percent of Android users who have had their devices that long.\n\nOf course, while Samsung is set to unveil what are expected to be at least three new Galaxy S models on Wednesday, iPhone owners will likely have to wait until at least September for their next shot at an upgrade, assuming Apple sticks to its usual playbook on timing.\n\nPrice counts\n\nNot surprisingly, neither group wants to spend a lot of money, though as it happens, iPhone users are more likely than their Android counterparts to indicate that they aren\u2019t planning to upgrade this year because new models are too expensive, at 45 percent compared with 35 percent. Android owners, on the other hand, are more likely than iPhone owners to say they\u2019re not planning to upgrade because they\u2019re happy with how their current phones are working, at 65 percent compared with 55 percent.\n\nPrice remains a huge factor. Thirty percent of respondents said they\u2019re willing to pay only $300 or less for a new phone. Twenty-six percent said they\u2019d spend between $300 and $500, while just short of 25 percent said they\u2019d fork over between $501 and $750.\n\nOn the higher end, 16 percent would pay between $751 and $1,000. Only 3 percent were willing to part with more than a grand.\n\nSamsung foldable display in a traditional phone mode. (Photo: Screenshot)\n\nGalaxy S9+ owner Bob Levine, an author at Lynda.com, responded to a USA TODAY question on Twitter by tweeting, he wouldn\u2019t spend \u201cnot one dime right now. I\u2019m not paying for gimmicks.\u201d\n\nFor his part, New Jersey attorney Mark McPherson told USA TODAY that he\u2019s much more interested in foldable phones as a means to increasing screen size, while still maintaining portability and some semblance of battery life.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nEverybody needs a place to rest their head sometimes. Most of the time, that place is on a pillow.\n\nBut have you gone pillow shopping lately? There are a LOT of options on the market: different shapes, sizes, and materials, all claiming to give you the best night's sleep. They can't all be right, so we at Reviewed put them to the test. We gathered the most popular and highest-rated pillows and tested them side-by-side over many naps and nights.\n\nWe cut through the fluff and the foam to find out which pillow was the best, and paired with our top mattresses from a box, sheets and comforters, you can put together the best bedding collection one can find.\n\n1. The best bed pillow of 2019: Xtreme Comforts shredded memory foam pillow\n\nThe best bed pillows of 2019: Xtreme Comforts (Photo: Jackson Ruckar/Reviewed)\n\nThe Xtreme Comforts pillow, despite its ominously overzealous name, is the pillow we're happiest to recommend for most people.\n\nThe pillow arrives rolled up and compressed, but once it\u2019s out of the packaging it fluffs up to full size quickly. (Keep in mind that some memory foam pillows take longer to adjust in colder temps and tend to stay firmer in cold environments.)\n\nThe Xtreme Comforts really shines when it comes to adjustability. The pillow\u2019s packaging states that is is intentionally \u201coverstuffed,\u201d so we removed about a quarter of the bamboo shredded memory foam and kneaded the pillow until the foam was evenly redistributed and it felt comfortable to lie on. Since the foam is shredded, you don't feel lumps and bumps\u2014the contents mold around your head, neck, and spine so you feel supported.\n\nWe also tested it at full capacity and it helped to relieve a tester's neck pain that's usually suffered from sleep. Xtreme Comforts\u2019 website claims that the pillow helps with proper alignment of your cervical nerves, so maybe there's some truth there.\n\nThe pillowcase is made with a Kool-Flow Micro-Vented Bamboo Cover, a feature you may particularly relish if you wake up hot in the middle of the night.\n\nOther things we like: The pillow is hypoallergenic and dust-mite resistant, and the pillowcase is machine washable.\n\nGet the Xtreme Comforts pillow on amazon for $49.99\n\n2. The best value pillow of 2019: Sleep Restoration gel fiber-filled pillow\n\nThe best bed pillows of 2019: Sleep Restoration Gel (Photo: Jackson Ruckar/Reviewed)\n\nThese gel-fiber filled pillows feel supportive yet fluffy and comfortable. It\u2019s named our \u201cBest Value\u201d because you get two pillows for less than the cost of our top pick, the Xtreme Comfort. The Sleep Restoration pillows felt comfortable without needing an adjustment\u2014which is good because you can\u2019t remove the super plush gel-filled fiber at all if the pillow is too high or fluffy for you.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t lay your head on this pillow and think it\u2019s made with \u201cgel\u201d at all until you rub the pillow between your forefinger and thumb to feel the gel fiber. They seemed lofty, but settle down to a comfortable height while sleeping on your side or back.\n\nOther things we like: It's dust mite and stain resistant.\n\nWhy it didn't win: The cover is not machine washable and the pillow is not adjustable.\n\nGet the Sleep Restoration pillow two-pack on Amazon for $41.49\n\n3. The Purple pillow\n\nThe best bed pillows of 2019: Purple (Photo: Purple)\n\nThe Purple Pillow is the most unusual of the bunch here. So while we liked it, we can't necessarily recommend it for everyone. The Purple is heavy, really heavy and if you tried using this in a pillow fight you might knock someone out. It's made up of a wobbly \"Hyper-Elastic Polymer\" in a honeycomb-like grid. There's a lot of space for the airflow in a pattern like that, which kept us cool through the night.\n\nThe downside is that there's not much give in the height. You can't \"squash it down\" to make it more comfortable and the push-back from the polymer might make your ears a little sore. Our female tester also found the Purple too tall. However, another editor in the Reviewed office absolutely loves it. Something this unique invites polarizing opinions. We suggest you try to get your hands on one before you buy. You can also check out our review on the Purple mattress, as well as the rest of the best mattresses in a box too.\n\nGet the Purple pillow from Purple for $99\n\n4. The Casper pillow\n\nThe best bed pillows of 2019: Casper (Photo: Casper)\n\nAt least one editor at Reviewed is on the record talking about his affinity for the Casper mattress, so it was natural that we wanted to try out their pillow. Though it may feel like a traditional polyester-fill, the Casper pillow is actually two \"pillows\" in one\u2014a softer outer core and a firm inner core. It's an effective design without feeling gimmicky.\n\nThere's a quite a lot of sinkage when you lay your head down. One of our tall, male testers was concerned at first that it might sink as low as a down pillow, but the Casper held firm at just the right spot, cradling the head and neck. One of our female testers named this her top pick and is all set to replace her old pillows with two brand-new Caspers.\n\nIf you're looking for a solid, traditional pillow that just nails the basics really well, the Casper is a good choice.\n\nGet the Casper pillow from Casper for $55\n\n5. The Parachute Home down alternative pillow\n\nThe best bed pillows of 2019: Parachute Home (Photo: Parachute Home)\n\nParachute offers soft, medium, and firm densities at various price points, and they actually recommend the medium firmness for back sleepers, with the high firm for side sleepers. We were surprised that loftier medium-density pillow turned out to be one of the top-ranked pillows on this list.\n\nThe \u201cdown alternative\u201d made from a hypoallergenic microfiber fill felt softer and more comfortable to sleep on than the partial down pillow we tried later with real feathers and down. I it was great for overnight sleep and its lightness and fluffiness made it perfect to toss on my couch for a nap. Since it\u2019s lightweight, this would be a nice pillow to fold in half and rest your head on against the window during a long car ride nap.\n\nGet the Parachute Home pillow from Parachute Home starting at $59\n\nPrices are accurate at the time this article was published, but may change over time.\n\nThis article features excerpts of product reviews published on Reviewed.

But no matter how much you love your salon shampoo, chances are you don\u2019t want to visit your salon to re-purchase it when you run out. It can be tempting to restock on Amazon or run to the convenience store around the corner, but be careful: if you do, you're at risk of buying counterfeit products instead of standby favorites.\n\nPaul Mitchell bottles warn: \u201cGuaranteed only when sold by a professional hairdresser.\u201d All of Redken\u2019s advertising states: \"Genuine products guaranteed only in salons.\" And the label on Matrix products explicitly states: \u201cFor sale only in professional beauty salons.\u201d And yet, you can find these salon brands on the shelves of your local drugstore. What gives?\n\nWhy you should never buy salon products at the drugstore\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sell our products directly to grocery stores, drugstores or discount stores, and our e-commerce presence is very limited and select,\u201d says Vikki Bresnahan, director of brand protection at John Paul Mitchell Systems. \u201cIf you purchase our products outside of a professional salon, these items may be old, stolen, or counterfeit and are diverted, or grey market.\u201d\n\nWhen salon quality beauty products appear outside of verified salons, it\u2019s an example of an industry-wide problem known as diversion. There is an entire industry dedicated to obtaining exclusive goods to make them available to the mass market\u2014and it\u2019s big business, says Bresnahan.\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Jessica Teich Paul Mitchell's warning label\n\nTo obtain the products, companies go to extreme lengths: theft, liquidation, fraud, or breach of distribution contract. In some cases, companies actually solicit salons to buy products and pay a premium (20-30 percent) over salon cost, usually in cash, she explains. They then resell them to drugstores and the like in attempt to offer \"brand names\" at a lesser quality.\n\nRedken warns that \u201cdiverted products can be counterfeit, diluted formulas, or old, expired formulas that may not be safe to use \u2026 if you buy our products in a supermarket, drugstore or any other outlet other than an authorized salon, spa or authorized salon related website, we cannot guarantee that it is an authentic Redken product that will perform as tested.\u201d\n\nThe risk of buying counterfeit salon products\n\nWhen these diverted products finally land in customers' hands, common complaints range from physical characteristics\u2014a change in fragrance or a product that seems thin and watered down\u2014to performance issues, says Bresnahan. These problems not only lead to immediate customer dissatisfaction, but they also damage the brand's reputation in the long run. \u201cWhen customers buy diverted products that leave them unhappy with its performance and the results, customers have a false impression about our brands in general.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also likely that consumers will pay more for these diverted products than they would if they bought from an authorized salon,\u201d says Bresnahan. \u201cThe prices in the mass market are anywhere from $0.50 to $5.00 per bottle higher than salon pricing; in some cases, we have seen product that is more than double the price.\u201d\n\nSo where can you safely buy salon-quality products?\n\nPurchasing salon products outside of an official retailer is never recommended since there is no way to guarantee their origin. Luckily, some manufacturers\u2014including Paul Mitchell\u2014have started their own verified programs with Amazon, so you can easily get your favorite high-end products with the ease of Prime shipping.\n\n\"More than 100,000 brands are enrolled in Brand Registry,\" says Maxine Tagay at Amazon.\"This means brands can ensure their information is accurate and customers can make confident, informed purchasing decisions on Amazon.\" But according to Bresnahan, prior to July 2018, all of the Paul Mitchell products on Amazon were unauthorized.\n\nSo how do you differentiate the unscrupulous sellers from the real deal? To ensure you\u2019re getting legitimate products, it\u2019s important to do your due diligence\u2014don\u2019t purchase salon-only products at stores like CVS or Target. And when shopping online, only purchase from verified sellers\u2014Paul Mitchell\u2019s own website and their verified landing page on Amazon.\n\nAdditionally, you have some protection when you're shopping on Amazon. \"Customers are always protected by our A-to-z Guarantee, whether they make a purchase from Amazon or a third-party seller,\" says Tagay. \"If the product doesn\u2019t arrive or isn\u2019t as advertised, customers can contact our customer support for a full refund of their order.\"\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether you\u2019ve landed at an authorized seller\u2019s page, read reviews (look for any red flags, including notes about scent, consistency, and effectiveness), check expiration dates, and contact the brand with any specific questions. And be wary of deals that seem too good to be true\u2014unfortunately, they just might be."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/tech/2019/02/20/galaxy-s-s-10-how-samsungs-phone-has-changed/2905832002/", "text": "None\n\n2017's Galaxy S8 shrunk the borders at the top and bottom of the phone to create Samsung's \"infinity display\" that allowed the screen to cover most of the front of the phone.

Keith Ellison, who also gave a speech on the convention floor yesterday, takes a less critical view. The second member of the House to endorse Sanders, Ellison \u2014 also the first Muslim-American Congress member \u2014 argued that the surface-level discord represented a healthy and necessary working out of underlying divisions.\n\n\"People invested their whole hearts into Bernie's campaign,\" Ellison told me in an interview Tuesday morning. \"So it's to be expected that some folks were taking a little longer adjusting to the reality that Hillary Clinton got more votes than our side. I think people are coming there.\"\n\nEllison also offered a theory for why Sanders fans are continuing to act out long after it became clear that Clinton would be the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"There is a certain school of thought that says, 'If Hillary is going to be the president, we want to let her know how we feel now,\" Ellison said. \"We want her to be clear that we're not for these free trade deals, and we're not for these foreign interventions.' That school of thought is that the way to partner with our president and guide our country in the right direction is by making our voices heard now. It's not a putdown. It's, 'We feel strongly about these issues, and we want you to hear it.'\"\n\nBelow is our Tuesday morning interview, lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nJeff Stein: So obviously it looked like there was quite a lot of discord at the Democratic convention last night. Do you think the worst of that is behind us after last night or a preview of what's to come?\n\nKeith Ellison: People invested their whole hearts into Bernie's campaign \u2014 they knocked on doors, they donated, and there were some things that made them feel that things weren't exactly fair. So it's to be expected that some folks were taking a little longer adjusting to the reality that Hillary Clinton got more votes than our side. I think people are coming there.\n\nI think Bernie's speech was awesome \u2014 focusing on the platform and memorializing what Democrats believe in, and the progress we made on that. And I think Michelle Obama was helpful in that regard, too, by saying, \"I'm trying to raise my kids,\" and \"I can\u2019t afford to have a thin-skinned person in the White House.\"\n\nJS: Did you sense that last night was beginning to convince the Bernie holdouts to come on board?\n\nKE: Yes. I'd go from yesterday to today. Yesterday, I was at some state party delegations where the feelings very raw and very strong, and I found myself mediating between people a little bit. Not a little bit \u2014 a lot.\n\nAnd this morning, I didn't sense any of that in the breakfasts, and I was going to states where there was a strong Bernie contingent. I think Hillary will continue to thank Bernie for infusing energy and young people into the Democratic Party and showing us you don't need to use big party donors. And as long as people feel that their efforts are recognized and appreciated, we will be absolutely fine.\n\nThe patience of some of the folks who have been with Hillary all along is very much valued. They could just say, \"We won; that's it.\" I don't sense people are taking that position; there's this sense of, \"We're all in this together, and debate is healthy and it's not negative.\" That, \"We had different views and approaches but we're in this together.\"\n\nJS: You mention the importance of having the DNC and Clinton appreciating Sanders and bringing him into the fold. What are you looking for as evidence that they're recognizing Bernie's impact on the party?\n\nKE: I think acknowledging that Bernie brought a lot of young people in and acknowledging that spirit of movement is a really important element \u2014 recognizing that Bernie really did bring that spirit of social justice, I think that would do really well.\n\nJS: There\u2019s been a lot of hand-wringing over parts of the Sanders delegation booing during many of the Democrats\u2019 speeches, even when Elizabeth Warren was up there. Do you think that\u2019s a bad sign for the party\u2019s divisions?\n\nKE: Some of it is not even upset; some of it is exuberant. There were people chanting during Bernie's speech. Of course, they don't disrespect him \u2014 they admire him. [Some] think, \"There's Bernie's trying to talk and they're yelling, 'Bernie! Bernie!,'\" and you could think that's a protest.\n\nOthers were yelling \"No TPP! No TPP!\" That's not so much protesting that individual. That's saying, \"We don't like TPP.\" I think it's important not to get too excited by that or too appalled if someone does something that you may not view as the most polite thing to do. This is a convention: It's not a manners convention. People are feeling strong and they're going to express their views.\n\nHere\u2019s something I want to point out: Look at Ted Cruz, who won\u2019t even endorse Trump. The luminaries of the Republican Party won't even show up. And then look at Bernie Sanders showing up talking about Hillary Clinton and that they made a difference not just on the platform but beyond.\n\nThere were some boos. Fine, we can deal with that. But we're all on the same page. Nobody's walking out. We'll be fine.\n\nJS: Last night, there was a lot of concern among some parts of the party when members of the Bernie delegation were chanting \"war hawk!\" during Sen. Corey Booker's speech. What did you think of that?\n\nKE: I would not join in that chant, but I don't think people offended by it should let that guide them too much.\n\nThere is a certain school of thought that says, \"If Hillary is going to be the president, we want to let her know how we feel now. We want her to be clear that we're not for these free trade deals and we're not for these foreign interventions.\" That school of thought is that the way to partner with our president and guide our country in the right direction is by making our voices heard now. It's not a putdown; it's, \"We feel strongly about these issues and we want you to hear it.\"\n\nJust remember: We're all used to these conventions where it's all over months before and we know the nominee. We've forgotten what the conventions are: They really are a place to select who the nominee is going to be. We really need to keep in mind that it's not outside the nature of the convention for there to be arguing.\n\nJS: I know I have to let you go, but is there anything else that people outside the Bernie movement need to understand about its internal dynamics? What do people looking from the outside in here tend to miss about what's driving these Sanders delegates to boo and make a ruckus at the convention?\n\nKE: The best way for me to help people understand it is that so many folks think that what happens in Washington is mostly about Washington and not the rest of the country.\n\nPeople feel that nobody's trying to help them get a better way to collectively bargain, to protect their communities from environmental disaster, to avoid starvation wages. They see Democrats taking money from the big businesses that are doing damage to working-class families. And they really just think they're doing everything they can do to draw attention to this devastating situation.\n\nThese families are devastated by payday lenders and they don't want to see the Democrats in bed with them and the big banks. So these people are smart, and they know that their families' best chance is with the Democratic Party. But there's no polite way to depart from the status quo; it's always going to be disruptive. For the ordinary citizens who feel that $27 is a lot of money, they feel locked out. And all they can do is try to raise a little hell to be heard."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12279190/democratic-convention-sanders-clinton-booing?utm_campaign=vox.social&utm_medium=social&utm_content=voxdotcom&utm_source=tumblr", "text": "The Democratic National Convention\u2019s first day in Philadelphia was supposed to be a grand demonstration of party unity and shared determination to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nBut delegates in attendance didn\u2019t get the message.

Meanwhile, ABC is heavily hyping Gaga and Cooper's highly anticipated live performance of the nominated song to get die-hard fans to tune into the Oscars.\n\nBut Gaga has never recovered her footing in the best actress race after Glenn Close won the Golden Globes and nailed an impassioned speech.

This is looking to continue the 81-year tradition of this story: a bunch of nominations and not a lot of wins.\"\n\nEven with Cooper's lauded fresh take on the fabled story, the explanation might be that Academy voters look down on remakes.

So when it stumbled, it was glaring.\n\n\"The minute the awards start to be handed out and they don\u2019t win, that so-called front-runner becomes damaged goods,\" says Hammond, who notes that anything can happen for a film which has clear industry support. In a topsy-turvy awards year like 2019, \"A Star Is Born\" could still pull out some unexpected wins.\n\n\"The studio still has endless optimism,\" says Hammond. \"But this is not the position they wanted to be in.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/02/20/heres-why-star-born-bradley-cooper-isnt-winning-awards-season/2911760002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/02/20/oscars-watch-when-where-who-hosts/2909831002/", "text": "CLOSE USA TODAY film critic Brian Truitt predicts who will take home an Oscar this year and who really deserves it.

Jennifer Lawrence trips over her dress (2013)\n\nCementing her status as Hollywood's most relatable (and clumsiest) star, the then-22-year-old fell as she climbed the steps to accept her best-actress trophy for \"Silver Linings Playbook.\"\n\nCher wearing Bob Mackie in 1988. (Photo: LENNOX McLENDON/AP)\n\n11. Cher turns heads in a see-through dress (1988)\n\nBjork had her swan dress and golden eggs at the 2001 awards, while Celine Dion wore a backward tuxedo and diamond-studded sunglasses to the show in 1999. But no one has made bolder fashion statements at the Oscars than Cher, who has unforgettably donned feathered headdresses and belly-baring gowns. Her jewel-encrusted naked dress may have been her most daring, which she wore when she won best actress for \"Moonstruck.\"\n\n10. John Travolta butchers Idina Menzel's name (2014)\n\nThe \"Grease\" actor launched a thousand memes when he introduced the \"Frozen\" star's performance of \"Let It Go,\" unintelligibly pronouncing her name as \"Adele Dazeem.\"\n\n9. Chris Rock takes no prisoners in his blistering opening monologue (2016)\n\nThe stand-up comedian made for a searing Oscar host amid outrage over the second year of #OscarsSoWhite, taking aim at the lack of diversity in the acting nominees, and stars such as Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith who boycotted the ceremony because of it. \"Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties,\" he jabbed. \"I wasn't invited!\"\n\n8. Rob Lowe opens the show with a bizarre duet (1989)\n\nThe actor was endlessly lampooned for his participation in this campy opening number, in which he performed a duet of \"Proud Mary\" with \"Snow White\"-clad newcomer Eileen Bowman. Stars including Paul Newman and Julie Andrews slammed the disastrous 10-plus-minute number as an \"embarrassment\" in an open letter, and Disney filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the Academy for using its character.\n\n7. Angelina Jolie shares an uncomfortably intimate moment with her brother (2000)\n\nTaking best supporting actress for \"Girl, Interrupted,\" Jolie uncomfortably thanked her older brother, James Haven, saying, \u201cI\u2019m in shock and I\u2019m so in love with my brother right now.\" They were later photographed briefly locking lips at the event, fueling speculation about their curiously close relationship.\n\n6. A streaker crashes the awards (1974)\n\nShortly before Elizabeth Taylor was set to announce best picture, gay rights activist Robert Opel stripped naked and ran across the stage behind Oscar co-host David Niven. He was not arrested, and merely explained that it was \"one of those one-time things.\"\n\n5. Marlon Brando refuses to accept his Oscar (1973)\n\nInstead of walking to the stage when he won best actor for \"The Godfather,\" Brando sent Native American activist Sacheen Littlefeather up to protest the misrepresentation of American Indians in Hollywood. It's one of the earliest instances of actors getting political during their Oscar speeches, with Patricia Arquette singling out the wage gap and Leonardo DiCaprio addressing climate change in recent years.\n\nAdrien Brody plants a stunning smooch on Halle Berry. (Photo: ROBERT HANASHIRO/USA TODAY)\n\n4. Adrien Brody lays an uninvited kiss on Halle Berry (2003)\n\nIn a move that's become even more cringeworthy to watch in light of the sexual harassment allegations that have rocked Hollywood this past year and a half, Brody brings Berry in for a long, awkward kiss when he takes the podium to accept best actor for \"The Pianist.\" The unplanned moment came just a year after Berry became the first black woman ever to win best actress for her performance in \"Monster's Ball.\"\n\n3. Marisa Tomei upsets with best-supporting actress win (1993)\n\nAfter Tomei beat out veterans Vanessa Redgrave and Joan Plowright for her comedic tour de force in \"My Cousin Vinny,\" conspiracy theories began to circulate in entertainment publications that presenter Jack Palance couldn't read the winner's card and called the last name on the teleprompter. The rumor has since been debunked by the Academy and footage from the ceremony, which shows Palance reading the card.\n\n2. 'Crash' takes best picture over 'Brokeback Mountain' (2006)\n\nIn what's considered one of the greatest upsets in Oscar history, Paul Haggis' race drama beat out Ang Lee's critically favored front-runner, making it only the second film ever to win the top prize without a Golden Globes picture nomination.\n\nJordan Horowitz, producer of \"La La Land,\" shows the envelope revealing \"Moonlight\" as the true winner of best picture at the Oscars 2017.

The jaw-dropping gaffe \u2013 which was met with stunned disbelief by those in the room and at home \u2013 was the result of a mix-up by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, who mistakenly handed presenters Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty the wrong category envelope.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/02/21/oscars-most-shocking-academy-awards-moments-ever/2883027002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/02/20/oscars-2019-five-best-academy-award-speeches-all-time/2912533002/", "text": "CLOSE We may wish we could forget 2017's painful best-picture flub, but these Oscars moments will be burned in our memories.

Tom Hanks (1994)\n\nTaking best actor for \"Philadelphia,\" Hanks exhibited the qualities that have helped him remain one our most beloved movie stars. He thanked his wife, praised his co-stars and accidentally outed his high-school drama teacher. But the part everyone remembers is the moving tribute he made to AIDS victims.\n\n\u201cThe streets of heaven are too crowded with angels. We know their names. They number a thousand for each of the red ribbons we wear here tonight,\u201d Hanks said.\n\n2. Halle Berry (2002)\n\nWearing a dress that would go down as one of the best Oscar looks of all time, the \"Monster's Ball\" star delivered an emotional and powerful speech. Berry was the first black woman to win best actress and her speech, delivered between sobs and gasps, recognized the gravity of the win.\n\n\u201cThis moment is so much bigger than me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It's for the women that stand beside me: Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett, Vivica Fox. And it's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.\u201d\n\n3. Cuba Gooding Jr. (1997)\n\nSometimes love is all you need. And enthusiasm.\n\nWhen Gooding won best supporting actor for \"Jerry Maguire,\" his earnest, sweet speech brought the crowd to its feet. When the music threatened to silence him before he got in all of his thanks, Gooding got louder.\n\n\u201cEverybody who's involved with this! I love you! I love you! I love you!\u201d\n\n4. Sally Field (1985)\n\nWe liked her!\n\nSometimes a speech rises above its time and place and becomes its own part of the zeitgeist. Field's joyful acceptance of the best-actress award for \"Places in the Heart\" was one of those moments. Her cry of \"You like me!\" (not \"You really like me\" as some mistakenly quote) has taken on a life of its own.\n\n\"I haven't had an orthodox career and I've wanted more than anything to have your respect,\" she said. \"I can't deny the fact that you like me. Right now, you like me!\"\n\n5. Jack Palance (1992)\n\nInspirational speeches can move the audience. But so can comedic ones.\n\nWhen Palance won best supporting actor for \"City Slickers\" at age 73, he celebrated by dropping to the stage for some one-armed push-ups.\n\n\u201cYou know, a long time ago in 1949, first picture \u2026 I'd been shooting about two weeks and the producer came to me,\u201d Palance said. \u201cHe says, \u2018Jack, you're going to win the Academy Award.\u2019 Can you believe it?

This is about the worst.\n\nGranted, bad movies usually don't get a shot at taking the biggest prize on Oscar night, but mediocre projects and the occasional head-scratcher do make their way into best picture from time to time \u2013 and some even win. Which means maybe \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" does have a fighting chance going into the 91st annual Academy Awards on Sunday (ABC, 8 ET/5 PT).\n\nKnowing that the actual best picture unfortunately doesn't always win, here are the 10 worst winners that the Oscars have awarded, ranked according to comparative terribleness.\n\nRanked: The 10 greatest Oscar best-picture winners (yes, 'The Godfather' is included)\n\nOscars costume party! Get up close with iconic outfits from 'Black Panther,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and more\n\nDev Patel and Freida Pinto find love and a dance sequence at the end of \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" (Photo: ISHIKA MOHAN/FOX SEARCHLIGHT)\n\n10. 'Slumdog Millionaire' (2008)\n\nThe story of an orphaned young man (a pretty great Dev Patel) who rises from the slums to win the Indian version of \u201cWho Wants to Be a Millionaire?\u201d \u2013 only for his victory to be questioned because of his background \u2013 is 99 percent of a very fine film. But at the very end, the movie features a giant song-and-dance routine \u2013 a shout-out to traditional Bollywood \u2013 that a little-too-seamlessly transitions out of the final scene and yanks you out of a satisfying ending. (Honestly, it\u2019s a weird pet peeve. And now I\u2019ve got \u201cJai Ho\u201d stuck in my head.)\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes were dreamy in \"Shakespeare in Love.\" (Photo: LAURIE SPARHAM/MIRAMAX FILMS)\n\n9. 'Shakespeare in Love' (1998)\n\nAs a concept, it\u2019s a cool idea: Imagine a romance between Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) and a woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) who auditions, disguised as a man, for one of his plays that helps the Bard write \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d Part romantic comedy and part experimental Shakespearean biopic with references aplenty, it\u2019s a tempest of random stuff never settling into cohesion but does remind you that old William was kind of a hip cat.\n\nMeryl Streep plays a Danish baroness who falls for a big-game hunter in \"Out of Africa.\" (Photo: UNIVERSAL PICTURES)\n\n8. 'Out of Africa' (1985)\n\nHoo boy, this sprawling epic romance is great to look at, and there\u2019s an embarrassment of acting riches with Meryl Streep and Robert Redford as a married Danish writer and a big-game hunter respectively who fall for each other in Nairobi. Which is all good if you can stay awake through the slow-paced narrative and 160-minute run time. When people speak of an \u201cOscar movie,\u201d \u201cOut of Africa\u201d is the kind of thing you automatically think of \u2013 for better or for worse.\n\nRalph Fiennes stars as an adventurous cartographer in \"The English Patient.\" (Photo: PHIL BRAY/MIRAMAX FILMS)\n\n7. 'The English Patient' (1996)\n\nTake the excessive length of \u201cOut of Africa\u201d and double the melodrama. Congrats, you\u2019ve got this World War II picture that\u2019s both ambitious and pretentious. A horribly burned pilot (Ralph Fiennes), once a cartographer, tells the military nurse (Juliette Binoche) treating him about the time he fell in love with a married British woman (Kristin Scott Thomas) while mapping the Sahara. Much to the chagrin of her jealous husband (Colin Firth), unsurprisingly.\n\nPhileas Fogg (David Niven, left, with Robert Newton) circumnavigates the globe on a bet in \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" (Photo: WARNER BROS. ENTERTAINMENT)\n\n6. 'Around the World in 80 Days' (1956)\n\nHuge back in the day, \u201c80 Days\u201d is a breezy, all-too-cheery affair starring David Niven as an English dude who wagers that he can go around the globe in just under three months and runs into an all-star cast of colorful characters, including 40-plus cameos from Marlene Dietrich, Cesar Romero, Peter Lorre, Buster Keaton, Frank Sinatra and more. If that\u2019s all it takes to win Oscar, \u201cThe Cannonball Run\u201d should have cleaned up.\n\nJessica Tandy stars as Miss Daisy and Morgan Freeman plays her driver Hoke in \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\n5. 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989)\n\nIn hindsight, it\u2019s perhaps looked down upon more for being the movie about a black driver (Morgan Freeman) and his elderly white charge (Jessica Tandy) that won best picture over \"Born on the Fourth of July\" the same year Spike Lee\u2019s influential \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d didn't even get a nomination. Still, \"Daisy\" is an emotionally manipulative, forgettable dramedy \u2013 one could even say Hoke-um \u2013 that has not aged well.\n\n4. 'Cavalcade' (1933)\n\nBefore the Crawleys of \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d there were the Marryots, whose family, friends and servants experience the ups and downs of life from New Year\u2019s Eve 1899 to New Year\u2019s Day 1933. It\u2019s interesting as a history lesson, seeing how Brits deal with the Titanic sinking and World War I, but pretty sentimental and empty otherwise.\n\nJames Stewart (left), Cornel Wilde and Charlton Heston star under the big top in \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\" (Photo: PARAMOUNT HOME VIDEO)\n\n3. 'The Greatest Show on Earth' (1952)\n\nLegendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s resume included \u201cCleopatra\u201d and \u201cSamson and Delilah\u201d before winning best picture for \u201cGreatest Show.\u201d But it was more of a career \u201cAtta boy!\u201d than an award for the actual movie, an ostentatious and forgettable three-ring ode to P.T. Barnum\u2019s circus \u2013 with Jimmy Stewart and Charlton Heston, no less! \u2013 that somehow beat \u201cHigh Noon.\u201d To borrow from Hugh Jackman: This is the greatest show? Nope.\n\nThandie Newton and Matt Dillon cross paths for a second time in an emotional scene from \"Crash.\" (Photo: LOREY SEBASTIAN/LIONSGATE)\n\n2. 'Crash' (2004)\n\nThe cast is amazing (Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard, among others), the film not so much. The interweaving of stories set around social and xenophobic tensions in L.A. fumbles a bunch of chances to deal with racism and multiculturalism in a real way. Making matters worse, it stole a best picture win from \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d a film that treated gay romance with heart and care.\n\nHank (Bessie Love) is part of a sister act that boyfriend Eddie (Charles King) wants to use in a new show in \"The Broadway Melody.\" (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\n1. 'The Broadway Melody' (1929)\n\nThe second best picture winner was the first sound movie to win Oscar, following the silent film \u201cWings.\u201d It easily could have won worst picture, too. There\u2019s novelty but not much else with this musical about two vaudevillian sisters who hoof it to Broadway and find showtunes, out-of-nowhere story interludes that don\u2019t fit and a ton of romantic malarkey. \u201cWings\u201d actually still plays well; this does not, at all. Go watch \"Chicago\" instead.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2019/02/20/oscars-10-worst-best-picture-winners-ever-definitively-ranked/2916524002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/02/20/oscars-2019-who-should-win-and-who-win/2916545002/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/02/19/oscars-2019-get-up-close-your-favorite-movie-costumes/2874762002/", "text": "CLOSE USA TODAY has launched an augmented-reality Hollywood experience.

Wochit\n\nFans have passionately championed what they believe is the best movie in this year's Oscar race. But have you had a glimpse inside those films?\n\nAhead of Sunday's Academy Awards (ABC, 8 ET/PT), we're unveiling our first-ever augmented-reality Hollywood experience, allowing readers to explore the underpinnings of epic costumes from Oscar favorites \"Black Panther,\u201d\u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d\u201cThe Favourite,\u201d\u201cMary Poppins Returns,\u201d\u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d and \u201cMary Queen of Scots.\u201d\n\nThis USA TODAY AR experience has everything: the ability to explore famous costumes as though you\u2019re standing right in front of them, interviews with the films' acclaimed costume designers and new celebrity tidbits!

Carter drew inspiration from ancient Africa, and propelled the aesthetic of Wakanda forward with wearable art and futuristic details.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the art of Africa, you see so many unique shapes, spiritual meanings \u2013 you see history, but overall, you see their version of beauty,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd she made sure the formidable Dora Milaje warriors weren\u2019t sexualized. \u201cWe wanted to honor the female form and not exploit it. So the costume is covering the vital organs. It's devoid of high heels. We wanted the Dora Milaje to be taken very seriously as the highest-ranking female fighting force in Wakanda.\u201d\n\n'Bohemian Rhapsody'\n\nYou'd never know how much work went into this seemingly simple costume from \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" (Photo: ALEX BAILEY)\n\nDisappointing Queen fans was not an option. \u201cOne of the challenges in representing Freddie Mercury in this film was to make sure that the fans were happy,\u201d says costume designer Julian Day. \u201cFreddie was very loyal to his fans as well, so I wanted to make sure that they were happy with his look.\u201d\n\nEven a simple outfit, such as his famous Live Aid costume (Adidas sneakers, jeans and a white tank top), \"was actually one of the biggest challenges,\u201d says Day, calling star Rami Malek\u2019s involvement \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\n\nFor the first fitting, \u201cwe\u2019d bought a few pairs (of jeans) and they weren\u2019t quite right. Rami went back to the States and found a pair and brought them back,\u201d he says, \u201cThen we approached Wrangler and then they found lots of pairs in their archives and sent as many pairs as we needed.\u201d\n\n'Mary Poppins Returns'\n\nDesigners hand-painted the costumes for this \"Mary Poppins Returns\" scene, which melded live-action with animation. (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nTalk about artistry: Emily Blunt wore gowns that were hand-painted with watercolors for a portion of \"Mary Poppins Returns.\"\n\nFor the Royal Doulton Music Hall song-and-dance sequence, the live-action and animated characters needed to be integrated, \"which is why I had the idea to maybe make them look as if they are painted in the same way,\" says Oscar-nominated costume designer Sandy Powell.\n\nIt was an unbelievably involved timeline. \u201cThat actual process will take several painters a good couple of weeks to do, and then the costume makers work a few days on top of that,\" she says. \"So each costume would have taken weeks to make.\u201d\n\n'The Favourite'\n\nFocusing on a palette of black and white for Emma Stone\u2019s social-climbing scullery maid in \u201cThe Favourite,\" Powell (also Oscar-nominated for this film) decided to slowly lighten Abigail's wardrobe, \"adding more and more white to the costume.\"\n\nAs Abigail climbs rank inside the royal household, her outfits proceed to have \"a little bit more white and the one after that has a bit more white until we end up with her final costume, which is mostly white with the bits of black, and actually a bit more decorated than anybody else is,\" she says. \"I wanted to show her sort of determination to succeed and rise up the social ladder.\u201d\n\nEmma Stone wore her first corset in \"The Favourite.\" (Photo: YORGOS LANTHIMOS)\n\nAnd, yes, corsets were required. Unlike co-stars Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz, Stone \"had never worn a corset before,\u201d says Powell. Between the underpinnings and the boning, \"it was a new thing to get used to.\u201d\n\n'BlacKkKlansman'\n\nWhile building the '70s-infused wardrobe for undercover detective Ron Stallworth (played by John David Washington), who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan, costume designer Marci Rodgers went thrifting, seeking out Stallworth\u2019s groovy walking suits, platform shoes and jewelry.\n\nThrift stores in and around New York \"have a lot of '70s clothing,\" she says, but you have to \u201cmake sure the lapels are wide.\"\n\nDesigner Marci Rodgers thrifted some of the '70s costumes for \"BlacKkKlansman,\" directed by Spike Lee (right) and starring John David Washington (left). (Photo: DAVID LEE/FOCUS FEATURES)\n\nDressing Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace) brought its own challenges. Rodgers describes high emotions during the shooting of the film's cross-burning scene, and how director Spike Lee forbade any phones being out.\n\nEven in dressing Duke, she strove for accuracy. \"I would hate as an artist for him to say \u2018That wasn't me,\u2019 or \u2018That didn\u2019t look like me,\u2019 or, \u2018My clothes look terrible,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\n'Mary Queen of Scots'\n\nRoyals would often wear the same ornate gowns over the course of their entire life.\n\nOrnate gowns would be altered as monarches aged or their weight changed, so \u201cit\u2019s hardly surprising that nothing really exists of the fabric of her clothes because they were worn so heavily,\u201d \u201d says Oscar-nominated costume designer Alexandra Byrne, who adorned Margot Robbie as Queen Elizabeth I in \"Mary Queen of Scots,\" which pits her against the Scottish Queen Mary Stuart (played by Saoirse Ronan). \u201cThey were stitched into, they were altered. The fabric would have been destroyed just by the day to day of it.\u201d\n\nIt tooks hours to dress royals like Queen Elizabeth I (played by Margot Robbie in \"Mary Queen of Scots\"), says costume designer Alexandra Byrne. (Photo: PARISA TAG/FOCUS FEATURES)\n\nMonths of research went into each look. \u201cIt's not as if I walk into a fitting room with this big Elizabethan dress and say \u2018Here you are, Margot, put this on,\u2019 \u201d says Byrne. \u201cIt's very much an incremental stage where you're building the silhouette, you\u2019re building the layers, the proportion, the balance, and how the movement works.\u201d\n\nDid you know gems were actually sewn onto royal gowns?\n\nElizabeth\u2019s lady of the bedchamber \"was in charge of the jewelry,\u201d says Byrne. \u201cOne of her duties when all the clothes were taken off was to sweep the floor to pick up all the stones that had fallen off. We used fake stones but they were real stones. These dresses were crusted with jewelry.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/02/19/oscars-2019-get-up-close-your-favorite-movie-costumes/2874762002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/02/19/oscars-2019-nominees-swag-bag-worth-100-grand/2907785002/", "text": "There's an outrageous variety of absurd and luxe goods in the \"Everyone Wins\" gift bag for big-name Oscar nominees.

At the 2017 Academy Awards, the musical \"La La Land\" was named best picture \u2013 and then it wasn't, when the correct envelope revealed indie drama \"Moonlight\" as the true winner.

The speeches will instead be live-streamed on Oscar.com and the film academy's social accounts. It's an approach used by Emmy producers to include awards given in an earlier ceremony for technical categories.\n\nThe Academy noted that in future years, four to six rotating categories could be cut from the live broadcast in this fashion. Cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short will be exempt in 2020.

In it, Close plays Joan, the overlooked wife of a famous author (Jonathan Pryce) on his way to collect his Nobel Prize for literature. (Fun fact: Her daughter, Annie Starke, plays her character in flashback scenes.)\n\nClose plays a woman in the shadows so effectively, she showed up to the Globes in January fully prepared to lose, \"for my own survival,\" she says with a laugh. \"And I thought, being the Golden Globes, that they would go with a flashy person, or somebody who didn\u2019t have as quiet a performance as I did.\u201d\n\nRelated: Wait, Lady Gaga's mom and Glenn Close are real-life friends (who lunch)\n\nClearly shocked by her win, Close went on to deliver a show-stopping speech that touched on the propensity of women to discard dreams, saying her own mother had \u201csublimated\u201d herself to her surgeon father and reached her 80s feeling as though she\u2019d accomplished \"nothing\" in her own life.\n\nIn \"The Wife\" Glenn Close plays Joan, a woman entirely overlooked by the literary community as she attends a Nobel Prize ceremony for her author husband.

She is a multiple Tony, Emmy and Globe award winner, who peaked on TV in FX's \"Damages\" before Peak TV existed.

So to have somebody who\u2019s doing all that for me makes it possible,\u201d she says.\n\nMeanwhile, Close appears as unbothered by this year's lack of an Oscars host as the slumbering dog on the table. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s the highest award you can get for film in this country,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the fact that they have to worry about ratings \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t really be the point. That\u2019s where everybody gets screwed.\u201d\n\nMore: Glenn Close says she feels 'as sexual and as eager as I ever have' at age 71\n\nWhen show day arrives, \u201cGlenn Close finally has the Oscar in the bag. Not even superstar Lady Gaga has been able to trip her up through awards season,\u201d says Tom O'Neil, founder of awards prediction site GoldDerby.com. \u201cOne sad thing: Soon Glenn Close won't be able to use her great, old joke anymore.

In fact, they might even hustle to the podium to make the best use of the time.\n\n\"Show us how eager you are to get up there and make the speech brief \u2013 yes, everyone,\" John Bailey, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, told the nominees from the podium at the Beverly Hilton Hotel grand ballroom, urging future winners to skip thanking people like \"your dog walker or Keto dietitian.\"\n\nLady Gaga, a first-time Oscar acting nominee for \"A Star Is Born,\" arrives at the nominees luncheon.

Rather than limiting speeches to the traditional 45 seconds before the orchestra starts, winners will have a total of 90 seconds to get from their seat to the podium and give their speech.\n\n\"The faster you get to the stage, the more time you have to speak,\" said Gigliotti.\n\nRelated: Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper will perform 'Shallow' at the Oscars, ending best song drama\n\nOscar nominations: See the full list\n\nThe producers played a shining example clip from the 2001 show, when Steven Soderbergh won best director for \"Traffic\" and beelined to the stage. Soderbergh told that audience he'd thank people in his life later, and went on to raise the roof by dedicating the award to the world's art creators.\n\n\"It's short but heartfelt and full of meaning,\" Gigliotti said of Soderbergh's speech. \"At the risk of sounding like a sap, that speech brings tears to my eyes every time. And you notice, he doesn't waste any time getting to the stage. That's what's really great.\"\n\nThe producers have a mandate from the Academy to keep the often-bloated Oscars to a strict three-hour deadline. Shorter speeches will be a part of that, as well announcing select (still unspecified) categories during commercial breaks, then editing those winning moments down to air later in the broadcast.\n\nSpike Lee, celebrating his first director nomination, arrives at the 91st Oscar nominees luncheon at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

The luncheon is an annual tradition for the nominees in 24 categories to celebrate their achievement.\n\nThe afternoon culminated with each nominee being called to the podium for a 2019 Oscar class photo, with Laura Dern inviting each up individually. The roll call started with Spike Lee (\"BlacKkKlansman\"), who wore gold athletic shoes and received rapturous applause for his first best director nomination, lead by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" star Malek, who stood and whooped his support.\n\nNominees for the 91st Oscars assembled for a class photo.

After the picture was taken, Elliott gallantly helped his \"Star Is Born\" co-star Gaga down from the risers.\n\n\"Today, in its purest sense, is a celebration of being part of a collective community,\" Dern said from the podium. \"This is our opportunity to recognize your profound input.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/02/04/oscar-nominees-luncheon-winners-get-90-seconds-speech/2773327002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/01/22/4-biggest-oscars-2019-snubs-nominations/2645234002/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/life/movies/2019/01/18/academy-award-winners-best-director-through-years/2613693002/", "text": "None\n\nMovie directors are the authors of the motion picture.

(Dec. 10) AP\n\nThe biggest drama in Hollywood right now is who the heck\u2019s going to host next month\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony, and the mystery has made it all the way into Helen Mirren\u2019s social circle.\n\n\u201cI was talking to one of the (Oscar show\u2019s) writers and he said, \u2018Do you want to host?\u2019 \u201d Mirren tells USA TODAY, followed by the kind of laugh that clearly states \u201cNot it.\u201d\n\nThe host search has been, shall we say, tumultuous. Comedian Kevin Hart was first picked for the gig, and then quit due to some old homophobic tweets, and then looked like he might say yes again but instead reaffirmed his no. Now it looks like there won\u2019t be an Oscar host for the first time since 1989, which Mirren says would be \u201cinteresting.\u201d (Hopefully it won't be as \"interesting\" as that infamous 1989 Oscars dance number.)\n\nHelen Mirren doesn't hate the idea of a no-host Oscars but likes having a comedic emcee who keeps everything in perspective.

It means you're not taking yourself too terribly seriously.\u201d\n\nWinning an Oscar is a fantastic and great moment, but one that could use some perspective at the same time, adds Mirren, who stars in the upcoming HBO miniseries \"Catherine the Great\" (slated for later in 2019) and the big-screen thriller \"The Good Liar\" (in theaters Nov. 15). \u201cEveryone knows that it's not like the shutdown of the government \u2013 it's not that important, if you know what I mean. And I think that the existence of the host, it's always a comedic role, it's there to make fun of everybody, and that's not such a bad thing.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2019/01/14/oscars-helen-mirren-says-no-host-ceremony-could-interesting/2574646002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/2019/02/15/how-host-epic-oscar-party-your-friends-remember/39014439/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/02/20/captain-marvel-early-reviews-praise-brie-larson-superhero-movie/2924230002/", "text": "CLOSE Marvel Studios shows a few more details in the backstory of Captain Marvel.

(Photo: WALT DISNEY)\n\nIf Walt Disney Studios and director Guy Ritchie were granted three wishes, one of them would surely be that Will Smith's Genie in the live-action \"Aladdin\" would find a little love.\n\nSo far, there's been overwhelming vocal consternation over the pivotal character in the remake that flies into theaters May 24.\n\nIt was always going to be a bumpy ride for anyone stepping into the curled genie shoes after Robin Williams voiced his iconic, exhilarating role in 1992's animated \"Aladdin.\"\n\nFans rejoiced when the Genie-less first teaser arrived last October. \"I fangirled so hard ... It looks so good!\" one tweeted. \"I'm legit over here sobbing,\" another wrote. But the very blue unveiling of Smith's Genie in a Grammy Awards telecast \"special look\" was skewered on social media.\n\nThe New York Times' Kyle Buchanan feverishly led the tweeted criticism, including, \"They premiered this image at night??? We are supposed to sleep after this???\"\n\nWe could go on about the chorus of social media barbs, which became such a thing that John Oliver used the blue Genie image as a punchline on \"Last Week Tonight,\" comparing it to the looming \"disaster\" when Britain leaves the European Union.\n\n\"You know how Twitter is. There\u2019s a pitchfork army out there and they all join in. And right now, Will Smith\u2019s blue Genie is out in front of this army, in a negative way,\" says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"The Genie just looked odd. And while it's called 'Aladdin,' all the attention since Robin Williams' role is focused on the Genie.\"\n\nFirst photo: The Internet is fixated on Will Smith's Genie, and not in a good way\n\nThe backlash: Twitter rips Will Smith's 'too blue' Genie after 'Aladdin' trailer airs\n\nDisney wouldn't comment on the marketing aspects of the film, which has stoked excitement with fans who made 2016's live-action \"The Jungle Book\" a major hit. The studio stood behind its Genie in a statement to USA TODAY: \u201cWe have one of the most anticipated films of the year and are confident that audiences will fall in love with the Genie and all of the characters when it hits the big screen this May.\u201d\n\nBringing out the Will Smith Genie, and the blue, has been a slow, deliberate rollout for Disney after two teaser trailers \u2013 as if to ease fans into the full live-action blueness against the formidable history of Williams' cartoon creation.\n\nThey premiered this image at night??? We are supposed to sleep after this??? I have never known peace pic.twitter.com/zUzl8X1Axw \u2014 Kyle Buchanan (@kylebuchanan) February 11, 2019\n\nIn December, a smiling Smith was unveiled on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, minus his CGI blue coloring. After fans reacted badly, the star assured them on Instagram, \"I\u2019m gonna be BLUE! :-) This is how the Genie is in Human / Disguise Form.\"\n\nThey didn't know how blue.\n\nHowever awkward the first look, the negative reaction shouldn't be a surprise, according to director Raja Gosnell, who unveiled his own bright blue update of beloved animated characters in 2011's live-action \"The Smurfs.\"\n\n\"We didn\u2019t have the Twitter world back then that we have now, thank God. But that unveiling was met with levels of horror and gnashing of teeth by the online community,\" says Gosnell. \"There is always going to be some sort of outcry by the keyboard warriors. It was going to be the same thing with the blue Genie from 'Aladdin.' \"\n\n\"The Smurfs\" went on to find its audience, make $563.7 million in the worldwide box office, and Gosnell brought the live-action creations brought back for a 2013 sequel, \"The Smurfs 2.\"\n\nBut there are many voices who contend Disney missed the vital opportunity to make a strong first impression that Smith's Genie could hold his own against Williams' legacy.\n\nCritics loathed \"Kazaam.\" But Shaq looked the part of a genie. (Photo: TOUCHSTONE PICTURES)\n\nPaul Michael Glaser conceptualized and directed 1996's \"Kazaam\" around 7-foot-1 superstar center Shaquille O'Neal. While the fantasy musical was disparaged by critics, visualizing Shaq as a genie was spot-on casting.\n\nGlaser says the decision to depict Smith as blue and physically pumped up, like a live-action version of Williams' character, wasn't \"a smart thing to do.\"\n\n\"Making him blue was a bit of cop-out. But even more than that was the big, muscular look makes this Genie more comparable to the animated version. Why does a Genie have to be all of that?\" says Glaser.\n\nHe would have preferred seeing more of what the superstar leading man could bring. \"They missed the boat in terms of trying to really explore what it would be like to rub a bottle and have Will Smith come out of it,\" says Glaser.\n\nSmith has made clear he will make the part his own in the final film, which EW described in the first look story as \u201cpart Fresh Prince, part Hitch.\" Smith, who acknowledged he was \"terrified\" to go up against Williams' \"iconic\" role, said in the piece his character was \"different enough and unique enough that it would be in a different lane.\"\n\nThere's still time for the formidable Disney marketing machine, with the powers of charismatic PR power player Smith, to right the spilled bottle.\n\n\"Disney has its own magic lamps,\" says Bock. \"And 'Aladdin' is fortunate to pretty much own Memorial Day weekend for family entertainment. So it's in good shape there.\"\n\nRobin Williams' Genie in 1992's animated \"Aladdin\" is a tough act to follow. (Photo: WALT DISNEY)\n\nPart of the marketing blitz will include a full trailer, which still hasn't been released yet. Perri Nemiroff, senior producer of movie site Collider.com, suggests \"scaling back on Genie in the marketing, that might be the smartest move after what we've seen.\"\n\nThe emphasis could focus on other \"Aladdin\" aspects such as Mena Massoud as Aladdin, Naomi Scott as Jasmine and their adventure story.\n\nThen Smith will have an entire movie to unfurl his full Genie.\n\n\"I just want to see Will Smith own that look and make that role his own,\" says Nemiroff. \"I'm hoping my optimism will not be misplaced.\"\n\nRandall Jaynes, who has made a career as a deep-hued member of Blue Man Group and is now its artistic director, believes people will come to love this Genie and his vibrant coloring.\n\n\"You could already hear this Genie is Will Smith. It had his jingle and pizzazz, but the color is so evocative, it changed the look. Of course, people are going to get used to it,\" says Jaynes. \"Welcome, Will Smith: Blue is a wonderful world to be in.\"\n\nMena Massoud as Aladdin and Will Smith as Genie in an early shot. Smith assured freaked-out fans he would be blue.

USA TODAY\n\nWhen it comes to professional wrestling, almost any outfit, stunt and trash talk goes. But there's one f-word that won't be tolerated.\n\nJohn Stossel learned that the hard way back in 1984, when he suggested during a \"20/20\" interview with wrestler David \"Dr. D.\" Schultz that the fights are \"fake.\"\n\nSchultz responded by clocking Stossel in the ear: \"You think it's fake? I'll fake you.\"\n\nEven today, \"you can't say 'fake' in front of a wrestler. It's a big taboo,\" says WWE star Paige (born Saraya-Jade Bevis).\n\nShe's the inspiration for a film that offers a much gentler approach to defending the realness of wrestling: \"Fighting With My Family\" (in theaters now in New York and L.A., goes nationwide Friday).\n\nDwayne Johnson, flanked by \"Fighting With My Family\" star Florence Pugh, left, and the film's inspiration, Paige. Johnson, a WWE star himself, couldn't sleep in a hotel one night when he stumbled across a documentary about Paige's family. He was moved to make a film about the Knights. (Photo: DANNY MOLOSHOK/INVISION/AP)\n\nThe film, which Dwayne Johnson opted to produce after being moved by a documentary about Paige's small-town, wrestling-obsessed English family, is written and directed by Stephen Merchant (\"The Office\"). Under his watch, \"Fighting\" becomes both a sports movie and a quirky British comedy that telegraphs the challenges Paige (Florence Pugh) faces when she's in the running to join the WWE instead of her heartbroken brother, Zak.\n\nAnd it uses that bad word.\n\nIn a scene where Paige's parents host the posh folks of Zak's girlfriend for dinner, Paige's former-convict dad (played perfectly by Nick Frost, a real-life fan of wrestling, with \"Game of Thrones\" star Lena Headey as Paige's outrageous mom) has to defend his lifelong passion. After the girlfriend's dad (played by Merchant) says that wrestling is \"fake,\" Frost says, \"It's not fake; it's fixed.\"\n\nMerchant says he wrote the exchange because \"I wanted to answer some of the questions that people like me, who never watched (wrestling) and had no knowledge of it, had. I wanted to flesh (out) some of those things.\"\n\nLena Headey and Nick Frost embody the parents of WWE star Paige (played by Florence Pugh, center) in \"Fighting With My Family.\" (Photo: ROBERT VIGLASKY/METRO GOLDWYN MAYER PICTURES)\n\nIt works: \"Fighting With My Family\" is a heartfelt movie about joining the WWE that appeals to non-wrestling fans. And may require tissues.\n\nThe first time Paige, who's known for her tough-girl persona in the WWE, watched back her life story, \"I cried my eyes out,\" she says.\n\nThere's a sort of \" 'Rocky'-style underdog story\" in \"Fighting,\" says Merchant, who reveals the rawness of the sport, including scenes in which wrestlers painfully land on tacks and grimace as medicine balls are thrown at their genitals.\n\n\"There's a real craziness to what they do,\" Merchant says. \"To any regular person or me, it seems like 'Why on earth would you do this?' But they love it.\"\n\nThe \"Fighting With My Family\" team at Sundance Film Festival, where the film debuted. From left: Florence Pugh, Stephen Merchant, Paige, Lena Headey and Nick Frost. (Photo: TAYLOR JEWELL/INVISION/AP)\n\nTo call scripted matches \u2013 which require extreme athleticism and cause real pain \u2013 fake is a figurative slap in the face to a wrestler.\n\n\"Fake is something where we're not putting our bodies on the line,\" Paige says. But WWE \"is predetermined.\"\n\nIn championship matches, Paige says that the outcome often isn't set \"until the last minute,\" when a referee is told in an earpiece who should win. And even for someone who's been studying wrestling moves since childhood and knows the safest ways to give and receive a beating, being in the ring is hard on the body, she says.\n\nPaige (played by Florence Pugh) jokes that she's been wrestling since she was in utero. Says Paige: \"As soon as you step foot in that ring, there's this adrenaline you can't describe. It's like a drug.\" (Photo: METRO GOLDWYN MAYER PICTURES)\n\nPaige, 26, who was a WWE Divas Champion in 2014, had to retire from performing in early 2018 because of spinal stenosis, which followed neck surgery (she had three screws placed) and temporary paralysis.\n\nGoing forward, she's considering \"new adventures inside and out of the WWE,\" including hosting and more reality TV (she's appeared on E!'s \"Total Divas\").\n\nBut former wrestling noob Merchant gets why Paige and others are so enthralled by the physically demanding sport. The Rock took him to see WrestleMania live in Texas, in an arena with 100,000 fans.\n\n\"You're up close with these men and women combining stunt work and theater and performance and choreography and showmanship ...

USA TODAY Sports\n\nJaylon Ferguson is headed to the NFL\u2019s combine next week after all.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports has learned that the star defensive end from Louisiana Tech, one of the top edge rushers in the upcoming NFL draft, has been re-invited to the combine for medical exams and team interviews \u2014 yet still prevented from on-the-field drills and testing \u2014 after Ferguson\u2019s previous invitation was rescinded after an off-the-field issue was discovered during a background check.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s change of heart \u2014 and tweaked policy \u2014 also clears the way for previously banned Mississippi State defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons and Colorado State receiver Preston Williams to attend the combine that begins Tuesday in Indianapolis.\n\nJaylon Ferguson takes part in practice for the Senior Bowl. (Photo: Butch Dill, AP)\n\n\u201cRather than having up to 32 teams travel individually in these cases, this is actually to accommodate the clubs, to frankly get the most important information \u2014 the medical exam \u2014 in one place,\u201d Troy Vincent, the NFL\u2019s executive vice president of football operations, told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nVincent recently informed clubs of the decision in a memo to general managers and head coaches, and maintained that in preventing on-field drills and testing, the players are still paying a price for off-field transgressions.\n\nAccording to ProFootballTalk.com, Simmons won\u2019t attend the combine due to recent anterior cruciate ligament surgery.\n\nFerguson, 6-5 and 269 pounds, the NCAA\u2019s all-time sack leader, is the most notable of the players who were previously uninvited due to a league policy that banned players who were convicted of a misdemeanor or felony charge that involved violence. Ferguson, a projected first-round pick, was found guilty of simple battery stemming from a fight at a McDonald\u2019s during his freshman year at Louisiana Tech.\n\nPLAYING TAG: One franchise tag candidate for (almost) every team\n\nCUT CANDIDATES: Some starting QBs among players who could be released\n\nFOOTBALL FIX: NFL news delivered to your inbox\n\n\u201cTo me, what I\u2019m hoping is that the NFL wants to celebrate the fact that a kid like Jaylon made a mistake when he was 18, and has made amends for it,\u201d agent Peter Schaffer told USA TODAY Sports. Schaffer is an associate of Ferguson\u2019s agent, Safarrah Lawson, who was involved in discussions with NFL and combine officials about the combine invite.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s earned the right for a second chance,\u201d Schaffer added. \u201cInstead of vilifying him, Jaylon wants people to see that you can earn a second chance. We\u2019re glad the NFL sees that.\u201d\n\nThe NFL \u2014 undoubtedly sensitive to perceptions of how it addresses violence by players \u2014 surely doesn\u2019t view Ferguson\u2019s case as a cause for celebration in the fashion that Schaffer suggests. Yet as Vincent pointed out, the practical efficiency for the medical exams is a compelling reason for the re-invitation.\n\nIn 2017, former Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon and former Mississippi quarterback Chad Kelly were the two biggest names not invited to the combine, due to incidents during their college years that involved violence. Mixon was ultimately drafted in the second round by the Cincinnati Bengals and has since flourished. Kelly was drafted in the seventh round by the Denver Broncos but flopped and was released in 2018, a day after he was arrested on criminal trespassing charges.\n\nMixon\u2019s denied entry drew the ire of some NFL decision-makers who preferred that one of the top running back prospects in the draft be in the mix during the combine evaluations. Several felt this way despite the legal issues he encountered and the one-year suspension he served after punching a woman in the face in an incident captured on videotape.\n\nIronically, Schaffer represents Mixon. But he added that the 2017 combine situation with Mixon never came up in discussions with the league about Ferguson \u2013 nor should it have. Ferguson\u2019s case is hardly comparable to the more serious allegations that involved the notable players banned from the combine two years ago.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said Williamson was diagnosed with a mild knee sprain.\n\nOn Thursday, the school said in a release Williamson's status is day-to-day.\n\nLike many top prospects in college football and basketball, Williamson has an insurance policy, a person with knowledge of the policy told USA TODAY Sports.

NBA officially proposes lowering draft age from 19 to 18\n\n\u201cThese have become increasingly popular, especially over the last 10 years,\u201d Keith Lerner, founder of insurance provider Total Planning Sports Services, told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s been led by the increased value of salaries in the NFL and NBA.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Action Network, citing sources, Williamson's policy stipulates that he can collect $8 million if he is selected past the 16th pick in June\u2019s NBA Draft.

There have been two insurance payouts out of the about 100 policies taken out over the last three years, Lerner said.\n\nOver the past decade, the NCAA has tweaked its rules when it comes to loss-of-value and disability coverage. College football, men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, baseball, men\u2019s ice hockey players are now allowed to take out loans for future earnings and schools can cover the premiums themselves.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s premium is covered by Duke, according to The Action Network.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

USA TODAY\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. \u2014 It was cold and rainy Thursday morning in Phoenix, and the forecast from Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark was just as gloomy.\n\nIt\u2019s premature to talk about a strike until 2021, certainly no one is walking out of camp right now, and even though Manny Machado just signed the richest free agent contract in history with his $300 million deal with the San Diego Padres, it hardly diminishes the frustration and anger coming from the players.\n\nBryce Harper will certainly get his money and starter Patrick Corbin got $140 million from the Washington Nationals, but baseball\u2019s middle class is getting squeezed out of the game.\n\nOnly five free agents have received contracts of four or more years this winter, with just 12 players guaranteed at least three years and a stunning number who have received nothing more than one-year or minor-league deals.\n\nWHAT'S MY WORTH? MLB free agents find themselves in the dark\n\nMLB 2019: 3 things to know for every team\n\nThe latest contract to send players screaming to the heavens was Josh Harrison\u2019s $2 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. Harrison, 31, a two-time All-Star who has been one of the most versatile players in baseball in his seven-year career, was frozen out all winter until finally landing a guaranteed contract.\n\n\u201cWhen you see things happening in the industry that we haven\u2019t seen before,\" Clark told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cEvery level of our membership is being affected as a result what we\u2019re seeing.\n\n\u201cSo the idea that Josh Harrison, as talented as he is, and the level of success he has had, who means what he means in the clubhouse, is case in point. These guys can help teams win, and if there\u2019s a commitment to it, there will be value derived from them. Unfortunately, what we\u2019re seeing suggests that commitment isn\u2019t what it had been in the past.\n\n\u201cWe still have an extraordinary number of guys that are out there. We definitely have guys that are out there who can help clubs win now, and for years to come, that still haven\u2019t a found home as we sit here.\"\n\nMLB's hot stove has been cold this winter. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nYes, we\u2019re talking about you, former Cy Young winner Dallas Keuchel. And you seven-time All-Star and four-time saves leader Craig Kimbrel. And you, Marwin Gonzalez, perhaps baseball\u2019s finest utilityman.\n\nAnd it\u2019s still beyond belief that five-time All-Star outfielder Adam Jones, 33, who happens to be one of baseball\u2019s greatest ambassadors and role models, has no job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening, and it\u2019s hard to explain,\" Clark said, \u201cbecause a guy like Adam can help a club win. A guy like Adam has helped clubs win. A guy like Adam is everything that is right about our game on and off the field.\n\n\u201cThere are other guys who fit that mode. There are other guys that fans want to see.\"\n\nSure, Machado got his money, but there were only three teams in serious pursuit of a 26-year-old All-Star who\u2019s considered one of the greatest defenders in recent history.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

It won\u2019t happen now, since the collective bargaining agreement doesn\u2019t expire until December 2021, but a strike looms as a possibility during the summer of 2021.\n\n\u201cIt suggests the seriousness of what we\u2019re seeing,\" Clark said, \u201cand the concern that guys have about where the industry is and where it\u2019s going. It\u2019s unfortunate for a second offseason,\" Clark said, \u201cwe find ourselves in a place where we\u2019re still asking the same questions why these guys haven\u2019t landed on a roster and why these guys\u2019 phones aren\u2019t ringing at all to the extent they could or should.\"\n\nThis is the second consecutive winter the market has been painfully slow, with star players signing after the start of spring training, and games beginning. It was supposed to be different this time around. The big boys in baseball, the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers, declared they were going to get below the $206 million luxury tax so they could dive into the market this winter.\n\nWell, the Dodgers\u2019 biggest expenditure was the $60 million they spent on outfielder A.J. Pollock. The Yankees\u2019 biggest free agent signing was starter J.A. Happ\u2019s $34 million deal. The Chicago Cubs spent $20 million to keep starter Cole Hamels, but the rest of their free agent expenditures were all $5 million or less.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of excuses and rationale offered last year as to why we may have been seeing what we were seeing,\" Clark said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re a second offseason in, and it\u2019s not an aberration. It\u2019s far more difficult to point to a lot of the excuses that were offered last year.\n\n\u201cThe free agent market was fundamental to our game going back to when Curt Flood took the stand he did. It\u2019s all predicated on competition. It works because teams are competing against one another. Teams don\u2019t want to be in the same room with each other. Teams are interested in one-upping and being the last team standing over the other.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t appear to be what we\u2019re seeing now.\"\n\nBOB NIGHTENGALE: More columns from USA TODAY's MLB insider\n\nClark and the players want to see all 30 teams trying to win a World Series, and not half of them more concerned about getting the No. 1 draft pick. They want to see teams spending like they care about winning, and not 20 teams being $75 million or more under the $206 million luxury tax.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the idea is that, 'Hope springs eternal\u2019 across the league,\" Clark said, \u201cas we start the season. And right now, we don\u2019t believe that is the case.\"\n\nSo, while commissioner Rob Manfred wants a 20-second pitch clock \u2013 which he is expected to implement this year without the union\u2019s consent \u2013 pardon the players for not worrying about the time of games at the forefront of their concerns.\n\n\u201cThe conversations we need to have,\" Clark said, \u201cis not about finding seconds [shaved off game times].

Embiid missed the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons with another surgery and rehabilitation.\n\nIt was worth it for the 76ers, who now have one of the best centers in the league. Embiid is a dominant big man, and the Sixers signed him to a five-year, $147 million extension through 2022-23.\n\nThis season, Vanderbilt guard Darius Garland underwent surgery to repair a meniscus injury in his left knee, and he remains a top-seven pick in respected mock drafts.\n\nWhat would it take for Williamson\u2019s draft stock to noticeably drop?

Embiid returned just fine from a similar injury. But other big men, such as Yao Ming, have long-term foot problems. Bol is considered a late lottery to mid- first-round pick.

Though CFL coaches only get one challenge \u2014 as opposed to two in the NFL \u2014 they are allowed to challenge these penalties, whether they're called, just like an incomplete catch or a player stepping out of bounds.\n\nMore: Steelers won't put transition tag on Bell or give Brown away in a bad trade\n\nMore: One franchise tag candidate for (almost) every NFL team\n\nFOOTBALL FIX: NFL news delivered to your inbox\n\nThe result: According to league statistics, 41 of the CFL's 72 coaches' challenges in 2018 involved pass interference calls or non-calls.

Formal proposals to that effect have been voted down by NFL owners each time.\n\n\"I just want to get it right,\" Ryan told reporters in 2016, when his proposal to expand instant-replay challenges was rejected. \"You don\u2019t want to lose a game based on a call.\"\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

Former President Barack Obama had a meme-able moment in reacting to it, and it appeared that the whole thing was just that, a funny moment of a large man's shoe breaking.\n\nIt quickly became clear it was more than that, though, and then the official word came from Duke: Williamson wouldn't return.

Williamson may have suffered a serious injury from a shoe that broke while playing a game in front of thousands of fans who had paid thousands of dollars to be there. Williamson wasn't paid to play in this game. As Tammi Gaw pointed out on Twitter, that shoe that busted for Williamson? He was wearing it because Nike had a shoe deal with Duke, one worth no small amount of money, none of which Williamson will ever see.\n\nI understand why Williamson may have wanted to go to Duke, how special this team is and how much it must mean to him to play in front of the crazies at Cameron. But he needs to think about his future. He has a professional career ahead of him, a bright one, and he is only jeopardizing it by playing in college.\n\nScottie Pippen argued that Williamson should have shut it down months ago, with nothing left to prove to NBA teams and only running the risk of injuring himself by staying on the court. People scoffed, but this time at least, Pippen was totally right. Whatever the prognosis, Williamson needs to protect his future. He's already given us plenty of beautiful moments at Duke.

They shot just 10% (2-for-22 from beyond the arc) against the Blue Devils and still cruised.

However, home matchups against Florida State and Duke plus a road trip to Clemson are opportunities to bolster their profile with Quadrant 1 (top-30 home/top-75 road) victories.\n\nIf UNC keeps riding its momentum \u2014 having won nine of its last 10 \u2014 there's opportunity to overtake Gonzaga or Tennessee at the No. 1 line. It'd take a collapse from Duke to surrender its No. 1 seed, and the selection committee will likely provide leeway if Williamson misses time but returns at full strength. And the other No. 1 seed Virginia was UNC's only loss in the last month and a half.\n\nThe biggest competition for the Tar Heels might come from Kentucky, which beat North Carolina in December. North Carolina (6) and Kentucky (8) have more Q1 games than Tennessee or Gonzaga (four apiece).\n\nWinning out all the way through the ACC tournament \u2014 with defeats of Duke and Virginia \u2014 would be enough to secure a top NCAA tournament seed, though that is a difficult task.

His win Sunday in the Daytona 500, though, will make any questions leading into this weekend's Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 (2 p.m. ET, Fox) at Atlanta Motor Speedway \u2014 the first with NASCAR\u2019s new engine configuration that will cut horsepower from 750hp to 550hp \u2014 much easier.\n\n\u201cCertainly, you hate the (questions) \u2014 it\u2019s just winless season, winless season, winless season, winless season,\u201d Hamlin said after snapping a 47-race winless streak. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, \u2018Yes I know.\u2019 \u2026 Now we can go this year and be relaxed and not have it hanging over head.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about going out there and doing your job and winning a bunch of races.\u201d\n\nThroughout last season, Hamlin tried to figure out why he couldn\u2019t match the performance of Busch. Hamlin won four poles and had 14 races where he started in the top-five, but he couldn\u2019t turn that into full-race success.\n\n\u201cIf we had a setup similar to Kyle, it was how was he driving it versus how was I driving it?\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cA lot of times, we were making the same speed, but he would just be better on restarts or their team would be executing a little bit better.\n\n\u201cAll those little things just mattered. You just try to find holes in all the details.\u201d\n\nThe team made the difficult decision following the 2018 season to remove Hamlin\u2019s good friend Mike Wheeler as his crew chief and elevate Chris Gabehart, whose nine wins as an Xfinity Series crew chief from 2016-18 included one with Hamlin. Wheeler, who helped Hamlin win the 2016 Daytona 500 to open his first season as his crew chief, moved to JGR affiliate Leavine Family Racing.\n\n\u201cSome of the greatest drivers had winless seasons: Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cI was never doubting whether I was still capable of winning races.\u201d\n\nHamlin admitted five years ago, he might have sweated over a winless season more than he did following 2018.\n\n\u201cSometimes you just get beat and sometimes it\u2019s circumstance and I understand that a little better,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cWe got beat most times (in 2018). We got beat by the racing gods three times to be honest with you.\u201d\n\nThe winless season weighed on Hamlin, according to his spotter Chris Lambert.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he lost any confidence in his own abilities, his own self, but you could tell it was just wearing on him,\u201d Lambert said.\n\n\u201cOutwardly, at the garage, at the race track, he hid it well. \u2026 It just wore on him to the point where you start questioning yourself what can happen next.\u201d\n\nThe Daytona 500 victory added to a Hamlin r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that now includes two Daytona 500 victories and two Southern 500s. With 32 victories, Hamlin ranks fourth among active drivers in wins and the only active driver with at least 20 wins to not have a championship.\n\nHamlin said he won\u2019t fret over whether he will win one. That isn't the confident side of him but more the realistic side.\n\n\u201cI just put in all the work I can to get it done and hopefully it happens,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cI could be done now and I\u2019d be totally content with everything I accomplished. I\u2019m not going to be burdened by any thinking over my head of not accomplishing this or that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already accomplished way more than I ever thought I would.\u201d\n\nBob Pockrass is a Fox Sports NASCAR reporter.

USA TODAY\n\nCLEARWATER, Fla. - Manny Machado will not walk through the doors at the Philadelphia Phillies' spring training complex, and there was not yet a Bryce Harper signing, either, on a postcard-perfect Thursday morning.\n\nYet just because Machado agreed to terms on a free-agent record 10-year, $300 million contract with the San Diego Padres, and there's a general presumption that Harper's forthcoming deal will meet or exceed those terms, doesn't mean players believe the system is functional.\n\nJust 35 days before Opening Day, a group of 10 free agents ranging from elite to highly useful, headed by Harper and pitchers Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel, remain. Dozens of others lurk behind them.\n\nAnd while the trickle of veterans finding jobs continues - second baseman Josh Harrison agreed to a one-year deal with Detroit on Wednesday - the rest are essentially in the dark.\n\nAndrew McCutchen signed a three-year, $51 million deal with the Phillies this offseason. (Photo: Lynne Sladky, AP)\n\nThat's how Andrew McCutchen describes free agency, 2019-style.\n\nMcCutchen jumped at the Phillies' three-year, $51 million offer in December, knowing that the market for 32-year-olds is dimmed, even for a five-time All-Star who reached base at a .421 clip last season.\n\nBut McCutchen still feels for those without jobs even after every camp has opened its doors to full squads, and the industry revels in record revenues now exceeding $10 billion annually.\n\nGABE LACQUES: More columns from USA TODAY's MLB insider\n\nALBATROSS: Do monster contracts pan out?\n\n\"There are just so many names out there. Big names,\" McCutchen told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday. \"Craig Kimbrel. Dallas Keuchel. A boatload of pitchers. Established names still not signed, trying to figure out, 'What\u2019s my value? What\u2019s my worth?'\n\n\"You see that one side is making this much money, and the numbers continue to go up. I need to know what my value is. You\u2019re trying to figure that out.\n\n\"That\u2019s why there\u2019s a halt. That\u2019s why guys haven\u2019t signed. Guys figuring they\u2019re worth this much, and the other side saying, \u2018You\u2019re not.\u2019 It used to not be like that.\"\n\nWhile the baseball world fixates on Harper - and the presumption that the Phillies will be his ultimate destination - McCutchen can't help but keep an eye on the rest of the market. He says it's \"crazy to me\" that veteran outfielder Adam Jones - who would not require a significant commitment in years or dollars - does not have a job.\n\nMcCutchen's gross earnings will ultimately top $100 million, and he's not seeking any sympathy, to be certain. At the same time, players in his situation still have tens of millions of dollars at stake, and the nebulous notion of value - and the uncertainty it creates - produces anxiety, rather than anticipation.\n\n\"I used to feel like, early in my career, going into free agency was fun,\" McCutchen says. \"You got offers, and through those offers you were able to decide \u2013 where do I want to go? I can pick and choose where I go.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

USA TODAY\n\nThe easiest thing to say about the knee injury suffered by Zion Williamson on Wednesday, however serious it turns out to be, is that it\u2019s just the latest example of how the NCAA exploits highly prized prospects, who assume all the risk to their future playing college basketball while being restricted from earning their fair share off games like Duke-North Carolina where tickets sold for thousands of dollars and drew celebrities like Spike Lee and former president Barack Obama.\n\nBut before you hold up Williamson as the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the ills of amateurism, consider the following two factors:\n\n1. There is practically no conceivable injury he could suffer on a basketball court that would prevent him from becoming the No. 1 overall pick in June\u2019s NBA draft.\n\n2. That would not have been possible without Williamson\u2019s year at Duke, in which he electrified the college game and put himself on a tier well above every other prospect in the world.\n\nZion Williamson walks off the court while holding his broken shoe. (Photo: Rob Kinnan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWe\u2019ll undoubtedly find out in the coming days whether the injury Williamson suffered in the first minute on Wednesday night is serious or a minor bump in the road, whether it will force him to end his college career prematurely or whether he intends to come back and play in the NCAA tournament.\n\nAnd all the while, a debate will rage among the amateur Twitter doctors and people who have no real stake in Williamson\u2019s future over what he should do and whether putting on a Duke uniform again would be too big of a risk.\n\nThat debate will happen concurrent to the typical screeds over the the NBA\u2019s one-and-done rule and the fundamental unfairness that a transcendent talent like Williamson, who has 2.4 million followers on Instagram, is not able to profit off his name, image and likeness during his one year of college basketball.\n\nBut as worthy as those conversations are, it is just as undeniable that Williamson has benefited greatly from the time spent at Duke, even if it ends now.\n\nMORE COMMENTARY: Read more columns from Dan Wolken\n\nAfter 25 games of college basketball in which he averaged 22.4 points and posted historically dominant efficiency numbers along with all the freakishly athletic highlights, Williamson has separated himself to a degree that the No. 1 pick isn\u2019t really even up for debate. Even if he suffered some kind of significant injury down the stretch like an ACL or Achilles tear, it\u2019s overwhelmingly likely the NBA team picking No. 1 would just roll the dice and wait for him to heal. That\u2019s how far ahead of the pack Williamson put himself this season.\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t have happened without him playing a year of college basketball.\n\nNever forget: While Williamson\u2019s dunks and quick-twitch athleticism at 6-foot-7, 285 pounds made him well-known on social media as a high schooler, he was not considered the best player in his age group until this season.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

Barrett and Cam Reddish. ESPN put him behind Barrett at No. 2. Had Williamson been able to go directly from high school to the NBA draft, he would have been a high lottery pick but almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have gone No. 1.\n\nWILLIAMSON HURT: Sneaker of Duke star blows apart in game's first minute\n\nDUKE GOES DOWN: No. 1 Blue Devils blown out by UNC after Williamson's injury\n\nDAILY SPORTS, DELIVERED: Get the best Sports news in your inbox!\n\nMind you, this isn\u2019t an argument for the current system. Players should be allowed to go directly from high school to the pros, and had Williamson been able to take advantage of that, his life and career would have turned out fine.\n\nBut look at what\u2019s happened in the last four months. Playing at Duke on national television twice a week against college kids who have no chance of stopping him has elevated Williamson from just another very good prospect to a marketing and television ratings machine. It\u2019s simply undeniable at this point that a year of college basketball has made him several more million dollars upon entry to the NBA than he would have as just another No. 4 overall pick that most fans hadn\u2019t seen.\n\nObviously, it doesn\u2019t work out this way for everyone. Some elite prospects go to college and watch their stock plummet as they struggle with the physicality and structure of the college game. Others, like Ben Simmons at LSU, are just wasting time.\n\nBut Williamson\u2019s college experience has been, from all accounts, a joyous experience. Rather than treat his year at Duke like a 401K, he\u2019s attacked it with reckless abandon and elevated his game, his reputation and marketing potential in the process.\n\nBut even if college athletes could be paid, even if they could collect on their name, image and likeness rights, it wouldn\u2019t change the fundamental fact that playing basketball is some level of risk to his future earning potential in the NBA. That\u2019s true in every practice, every workout and every game until he gets drafted, and it never goes away.\n\nSo if Williamson wants to shut it down until the draft because he got a scare Wednesday night, you can\u2019t blame him. If he wants to accept that risk and keep playing because it means a lot to him to play for a national championship, that\u2019s fine, too.\n\nEither way, the odds are overwhelming that no matter what happens, Williamson is going to be the first player to walk across the stage on June 20 and shake NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s hand.\n\nSo while there are plenty of reasons to crush college basketball and question its utility for many of the top prospects, Williamson\u2019s experience isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken on Twitter @DanWolken."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2019/02/18/ncaa-tournament-bubble-tracker-march-madness-college-basketball-bracket/2903256002/", "text": "The NCAA tournament bubble is flat out soft this year.\n\nThe selection committee and bracketologists alike are usually hard-pressed to determine which fringe teams make the cut in the field of 68 \u2014 because there are so many. But this year, it's more of a puzzle to find teams that are worthy to be part of March Madness.\n\nAs a result, there's a possibility for typically disregarded mid-majors to seize the opportunity by securing at-large bids that are usually hard to come by.\n\nThat rare possibility starts in the Southern Conference. League leader Wofford (23-4, 15-0) is good enough to get in as an at-large (currently projected as a No. 8 seed) should it lose in the league tournament.\n\nFurman has a chance to make the Southern Conference a two or three-team league with NCAA tournament bids come Selection Sunday. (Photo: Stephen Lew, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Terriers have a ranking in the top 25 of the NET, the NCAA's new metric in place of the RPI. If the committee fully values this tool, expect to see them dancing even if they fall in the Southern tournament semifinals.\n\nThere's two chasers with slimmer chances to attain at-large bids in Furman (22-5, 11-4) and UNC-Greensboro (22-5, 11-3).\n\nThe best case scenario for the league is that Furman beats Wofford this weekend and then wins out the rest of the regular season. Should the Paladins lose in the semis of the league tourney, those results should still get them an at-large bid with the bubble this soft. Credit that mostly to a 42 NET score and a signature victory at Villanova.\n\nUNC-Greensboro holds a top-60 NET but really doesn't have many opportunities outside of the Southern tournament to bolster its r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Should the Spartans beat Wofford (a team it lost to by 30 last week) there but not win the whole thing, there's a chance. But UNCG is the outlier in this three-bid scenario. Winning the conference tournament is a must to avoid an NIT consolation prize on Selection Sunday.\n\nEither way, there's a good possibility for the Southern to be a multiple bid mid-major league, and all three of these teams have veteran, fundamentally-sound rosters ready to bust brackets.\n\nOn the bubble line Wednesday, Georgetown played itself into the field of 68 \u2014 as a No. 12 seed \u2014 by picking up a marquee victory vs. Villanova. That bracket movement pushed fellow Big East bubble team Butler out of the projected field. Another borderline Big East team, Seton Hall, lost to Xavier by one which pushes the Pirates closer to the wrong side of the bubble.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

USA TODAY\n\nThe stretch run is upon us, and a familiar cast of NBA teams will likely dominate the conversation over the final seven weeks of the regular season. But that doesn't mean those are the only story lines worth watching.\n\nThe top teams will certainly get plenty of love. Can the Milwaukee Bucks maintain the top spot in the Eastern Conference? Will the Golden State Warriors hold off the Denver Nuggets for the No. 1 seed in the West? How will the Toronto Raptors and Philadelphia 76ers integrate their big trade deadline acquisitions?\n\nTeams that aren't at the top of the standings but surrounded by drama will get a lot of attention, too.

Instead, let's dive into five teams that aren't getting a ton of attention but are still worth your time over the remainder of the regular season.\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nDe'Aaron Fox (5) and Buddy Hield (24) are looking to get the Kings back to the playoffs for the first time since 2006. (Photo: Sergio Estrada, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe race for the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs will be fierce, and a young, hungry Kings team figures to be in the thick of it. De'Aaron Fox has emerged as one of the best young point guards in the league and Buddy Hield as one of the best outside shooters. They have size and versatility on the perimeter and capable young bigs inside.\n\nSacramento made moves at the trade deadline in an effort to end the league's longest playoff drought. The Kings lack veteran experience but won't back down from anyone as they pursue their first playoff berth since 2006. And without a first-round pick in this year's draft, there's no incentive to tank down the stretch. Plus, it would be poetic if they kept their one-time nemesis Lakers out of the postseason.\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nPerhaps not quite as under-the-radar as others, the Pacers were essentially written off by everyone outside Indiana after Victor Oladipo's season-ending injury. The expected free-fall hasn't happened, though, and the Pacers still occupy third place in the Eastern Conference.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

The Pacers are still a lock to make the playoffs and likely no worse than the fifth seed. But do they have enough to stay where they are and crack the Milwaukee-Toronto-Boston-Philadelphia quartet that everyone has penciled in as the top four seeds?\n\nTRYIN' FOR ZION: NBA bottom-feeders enamored with Duke phenom\n\nMVP RACE: James Harden has been historic, but is he the MVP?\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nCaris LeVert (22) is back on the court for the Nets, and Spencer Dinwiddie (8) is expected to return soon. (Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOne of the biggest surprises of the season, the Nets appear to be the safest bet to make the playoffs among teams in the lower half of the East chase. The Nets are still relatively young, but they've been consistent this season. A playoff appearance would be a huge boost for a franchise that was in salary-cap hell just a few years ago.\n\nD'Angelo Russell matured into an All-Star this season. Caris LeVert is back after an early-season foot injury that looked like it could cost him the rest of the year. Spencer Dinwiddie is expected to return from a thumb injury later this month or in early March. The rebuild in Brooklyn should take a big step forward this spring.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nAs has been the case the past several years, the bottom of the Eastern Conference playoff race is a bit of a mess. The final two spots will be filled from a group of five teams, all of whom are currently under .500. The Heat enter the stretch run tied with the Pistons for eighth, but they're also just 2\u00bd games behind the sixth-place Nets.\n\nMiami lacks a true No. 1 option but has a better collection of talent than other teams in the mix like Charlotte, Orlando or Washington. Goran Dragic is on the verge of returning to the floor after December knee surgery, which should buoy Miami's late-season push for the playoffs. And the postseason will be much more fun if retiring Dwyane Wade's #OneLastDance includes one final playoff appearance.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nThe Mavericks find themselves in a tough spot. They don't have a guaranteed first-round pick in this year's draft. Their selection transfers to the Hawks if it falls outside the top five, which presents a dilemma: Tank to improve their lottery odds and hope for a top-five pick, or try to push for the playoffs and start conveying the many first-rounders they owe?\n\nIt will be interesting to see the direction Dallas takes in the final seven weeks. Another high draft pick to pair with rookie sensation Luka Doncic and recently-acquired Kristaps Porzingis may be the smarter long-term strategy. But Doncic's stellar play could keep the Mavericks out of the top five selections.\n\nFollow Matt Eppers on Twitter @meppers_."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/02/21/nba-roundtable-lebron-james-los-angeles-lakers-west-east-playoffs/2930196002/", "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers are in serious danger of missing the playoffs. But will they?\n\nWhat about the rest of the Western Conference, which, aside from the Golden State Warriors, Denver Nuggets and Oklahoma City Thunder, is basically up for grabs?\n\nAnd the East? The Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Indiana Pacers, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers are locks, but it's a mess after that.\n\nWith the final stretch of the 2018-19 NBA regular season upon us, USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt, Martin Rogers, AJ Neuharth-Keusch and Matt Eppers take a look at three of the league's burning questions in this NBA roundtable.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWill the Lakers make the playoffs?\n\nZillgitt: One thing I\u2019ve learned over the years covering LeBron James: Never count him out. James last missed the playoffs in 2005, his second season in the league. That\u2019s 13 consecutive playoff appearances and 13 in a row with winning at least one series. James\u2019 streak of reaching the Finals for the ninth consecutive time is in serious jeopardy, but getting to the playoffs, even though the Lakers are in 10th place and three games behind the Clippers, is doable. When the Lakers were healthy this season, they were a top-four team in the West. If they can replicate a portion of that, they can get to the playoffs. But they need James engaged. The faster Lonzo Ball returns to the lineup, the better, too.\n\nRogers: Not this year. James has the forcefulness to carry a team on his back, but having to do that for seven weeks is a mighty task. Sure, James is enough of a competitor that he won\u2019t love the idea of missing the playoffs, but sneaking in just to be served as Warriors fodder doesn\u2019t sound like a ton of fun. James\u2019 supporting cast looked disinterested and bereft of confidence before the break, and those frailties persist. A mid-March trip will be the acid test, though if they survive it, the home-heavy end to the schedule offers relief. The deciding factor will be that despite James\u2019 influence, there are other teams that are hungrier, and more cohesive.\n\nNeuharth-Keusch: Nope, and it'll be due to a Sacramento team that hasn't made the postseason since 2006. James' groin injury forced him to miss 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers went 6-11 and dropped from fourth in the West to ninth during that span. It's not insurmountable, and I'll probably eat my words for betting against LeBron, who says his playoff mode has been \"activated.\" But I'm doing it anyway. Also worth noting: The Lakers have the ninth-toughest schedule in the league for the remainder of the season, per Tankathon.\n\nEppers: Yes, but with a bit of trepidation. Los Angeles is teetering on the brink, with most statistical models currently having the Lakers out, and the last seven weeks are going to be a real fight. The Clippers and Kings aren\u2019t going away, and even Minnesota is still lingering. But the Lakers have the ultimate deciding factor in the best player, and I\u2019m still not ready to bet against a LeBron-led team making the playoffs. I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\n\nFinal three teams to make East playoffs?\n\nZillgitt: It\u2019s essentially six teams \u2013 if you want to count Washington \u2013 vying for the final three spots. Sixth-place Brooklyn has been consistent enough all season to earn a spot, which leaves five teams for two spots: Charlotte, Detroit, Miami, Orlando and Washington. All five are under .500 and have been inconsistent enough to make this a difficult decision. It\u2019s a bit of a crapshoot, but I\u2019m going with Charlotte and Miami. The Hornets believe it\u2019s important to get in, and the Heat have been good enough on the road to sneak in \u2013 if they can win games at home.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

More newsletters\n\nRogers: Much-matured DeAngelo Russell will ensure the Nets hold their advantage and lock up sixth. The Magic are surging behind Nikola Vucevic and should ride that momentum into the postseason. The Hornets will need to make the most of having seven of their first eight post-All Star games at the Spectrum Center. But I don\u2019t like the look of their schedule, packed with late road swings and match-ups against teams with plenty to play for. Instead, the Pistons are good for eighth, provided Blake Griffin remains productive.\n\nBrooklyn Nets forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and center Jarrett Allen. (Photo: Noah K. Murray, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNeuharth-Keusch: Brooklyn, Miami and Detroit. The Nets have the best chance of any of these teams to do it. The Heat and Pistons could very well lose out to the Hornets and Magic, but the Heat are on the verge of getting Goran Dragic back and the Pistons have one of the easiest remaining schedules in the league. The Magic do, too, but I'm rolling with the Dwane Casey-led group that only has one playoff appearance in the last nine years.\n\nEppers: Brooklyn, Detroit and Miami. With Caris LeVert back, Brooklyn is the safest bet to make the playoffs among teams in the 6-11 seed range. Detroit appears to have righted the ship after a dismal December and January. Miami lacks a true No. 1 option but has a better collection of talent than Charlotte, Orlando or Washington, and will be motivated to send the retiring Dwyane Wade out with one final playoff appearance.\n\nFinal five teams to make West playoffs?\n\nZillgitt: Six games separate fifth place from 11th place in the West, and two games separate sixth place from ninth place. Houston, Utah, Portland and San Antonio are in. That leaves one spot among the two Los Angeles teams and Sacramento. The Clippers have to give up their first-round pick if they make the playoffs, so what\u2019s best \u2013 keeping their pick or losing in the first round? Easy. Keep the pick. The Kings want in and have a good chance, and it would be fun to see the upstart squad in the postseason. Don\u2019t discount LeBron for a Lakers-Warriors first-round series.\n\nRogers: Portland and Houston are in, and are mainly concerned with clinching home-court, plus capitalizing on any slips from the Thunder. After shaky starts, the Jazz and Spurs are well equipped to withstand any late push from below, and will have some confidence going into any non-Warriors postseason series. Truthfully, this is a race for eighth, brought into sharper focus by the Clippers shipping off their best player, Tobias Harris. The Kings are in the best form but are low on veteran experience, while the Lakers\u2019 problems have been detailed. It might boil down to who wants it most. The Kings let leads slip too often but have shown the most pluck all season.\n\nSacramento Kings guard De'Aaron Fox. (Photo: Sergio Estrada, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNeuharth-Keusch: The Rockets are getting Clint Capela back, the Jazz just had their best month of the season and the Blazers' additions of Rodney Hood and Enes Kanter make them much deeper. Those three teams are in. The Spurs are, too, because they've never missed the playoffs under Gregg Popovich and that's not changing. As for the eighth spot? Welcome back to the postseason, Sacramento. Not only are the Kings fun and motivated, but they're actually good. De'Aaron Fox is becoming a star, Buddy Hield might be the best shooter in the NBA not in Golden State, and Marvin Bagley III has shown flashes of greatness.\n\nEppers: After the top three teams, Houston, Portland and Utah all appear to be safe playoff picks barring any catastrophic injuries or unforeseen collapses. In typical fashion, San Antonio is quietly chugging along in seventh place and also well-positioned for the postseason, with FiveThirtyEight giving the Spurs a 91 percent chance of making it. The only real drama will be for the eighth seed, and as noted above, the presence of LeBron gives the Lakers the edge for the final spot."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2019/02/21/kyrie-irving-rumors/39090701/", "text": "Kyrie Irving shot out again at a media member this week, unleashing a flurry of rhetorical questions when the media member asked about a video that surfaced that appeared to show Irving discussing future free agency with Kevin Durant.\n\nThe video was filmed in a hallway at the All-Star Game and captured a private conversation between Irving and Durant. During the scrum, the media member tried to give Irving a chance to downplay the fan theories that were popping up around it (the biggest theory being that Irving was trying to convince Durant to sign with him for the Knicks when they both became free agents). Irving was asked if he cared to \"pour water\" on the rumors.\n\nIrving did not care to pour water. What he did care to do was ask about 75 rhetorical questions about private life, the trappings of fame, the reality of internet culture, the pursuit of clicks, what video means, etc. etc.\n\nIf you care to wade through it, the entire conversation is here:\n\nHere's the full exchange Kyrie Irving had with reporters about that video with Kevin Durant: pic.twitter.com/diVTWWmYEd \u2014 Jay King (@ByJayKing) February 21, 2019\n\nI'll admit, when I first read this, I found myself empathizing with Irving. It must be exhausting to be famous, I found myself thinking upon reading his response. Having every word analyzed, every private conversation broken down by fans who are desperate to see what you do next, has to be taxing.\n\nThen I took a moment, and realized: Wait, what Irving is saying doesn't make any sense.\n\nI can empathize with Irving over the frustrations that come with fame, but that doesn't make his rant logical. Irving was caught discussing a possible free agent future with Kevin Durant. He was stupid to get caught doing this, mostly because he chose a hallway at the NBA All-Star Game to have this conversation, and not, you know, like a phone call in the privacy of his home. Cameras were around. I feel for him, but also, does he know how the NBA works?\n\nIrving is like a 10th grader about to get a C- in debate class: When he gets a question he doesn't like, he throws out a lot of big sounding questions to try and put the other person on the defensive.\n\nFTW: Zion Williamson should never play a minute of college basketball again\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

(AP) \u2014 The Ottawa Senators' decision to sell off talent heading into the NHL trading deadline worked very well for Cory Schneider and the New Jersey Devils.\n\nSchneider made 30 saves in posting his first shutout since November 2017 and Devils beat the undermanned Senators 4-0 on Thursday night in a game in which both teams gave indications they were getting ready to make trades in the next few days.\n\n\"It's never easy,\" Schneider said of the trading deadline. \"You get to know these guys well and their families and, again, they're not gone right just yet so you have to wait and see what happens but just like we did tonight you have to be ready to play and move forward.\"\n\nBoth teams are likely going to make trades before Monday's deadline.\n\nOttawa scratched Mark Stone, Matt Duchene and Ryan Dzingel, its first, second- and fourth-leading scorers. Trade rumors have swirled about the forwards in recent weeks, and this was another sign the future free agents would be dealt.\n\nThe Devils scratched forward Marcus Johansson and veteran defenseman Ben Lovejoy. Johansson has been rumored to be on the trading block, while Lovejoy has played for a Stanley Cup winner with Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Both teams dealt with the same opportunities for distractions with guys being taken out of the lineup and I thought that our group was mentally ready to play,\" coach John Hynes said.\n\nThe Devils were more than ready to go in winning for the third time in four games. They held the Senators to four first-period shots in opening a 2-0 lead and doubled it in the second period.\n\nTravis Zajac, Steven Santini, Kurtis Gabriel and Miles Wood got the goals.\n\nAnders Nilsson had 27 saves for the Senators, whose 22-33-5 record is the worst in the NHL this season.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

At the end of the day, it's their decision. They are the ones that own the business and pay the bills. That's their choice and rightfully so. We get a paycheck to go out there and play hockey, it's our job to play to the best of our ability. That's all I can control.\"\n\nCoach Guy Boucher said general manager Pierre Dorion told him just before the team left for the arena that Stone, Duchene and Dzingel would be held out. He said he has heard nothing about them being traded.\n\n\"I am a coach and it's not a question for me, to be honest,\" he said. \"It's a question for personnel and that's Pierre. I coach the players I have and that's what I focus on.\"\n\nZajac gave the Devils the lead at 11:45, deflecting a shot by Wood past Nilsson. Santini got his first of the season less than three minutes later when Senators defenseman Thomas Chabot had a skate problem that prevented Ottawa from clearing its zone.\n\nSantini was in the lineup because Lovejoy was scratched.\n\nGabriel got his first NHL goal at 3:40 of the second period after Brett Seney won a faceoff. Wood scored with 5:08 left in the period, re-directing a Damon Severson pass into the net.\n\nThe only question after that was whether Schneider would win his third straight and get his shutout. He got a little help late in the second period when a shot by Filip Chlapik \u2014 who was called up from the minors for the game \u2014 hit off the crossbar.\n\nSchneider also made an excellent stop on Jean-Gabriel Pageau late in the second and magnificent skate stop on Marnus Paajarvi early in the third.\n\nNOTES: The Senators also recalled F Darren Archibald from Belleville (AHL) before the game. ... Ottawa dressed seven defenseman, with Cody Goloubef getting some shifts. ...

Poole played particularly effective defense on Gabe Kalscheur, the best 3-point shooter in Minnesota's lineup by limiting him to three attempts and one make.\n\n\"I was just locked in, and like they said, the offensive side will come with it,\" Poole said. \"\n\nCOFFEY SHOP CLOSED\n\nThe Wolverines, who are allowing 57.7 points per game that's the third-lowest average of all NCAA Division I teams, didn't need much time to fluster the Gophers. Amir Coffey missed his first 10 shots from the floor and finished 2 for 15 for six points.\n\nSome of Coffey's attempts to get the Gophers going were forced off-balance heaves, but his first open look was an air-balled 3-pointer.\n\nIn a sign of how poorly the night was going for the Gophers on offense and how much the Wolverines were in sync, Dupree McBrayer made a slick pass from the perimeter to the baseline for Eric Curry on a late-first-half possession. As soon as Curry brought the ball down to waist level in his advance to the basket, Isaiah Livers stuffed his layup attempt cold to preserve a 24-14 lead.\n\nPitino saw his players resort to trying to draw fouls rather than work for better shots, after the early struggle.\n\n\"It's hard when that ball's not going in the basket. It deflates you,\" Pitino said. \"You've got to get tougher, and you've got to dig in.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMichigan: The Wolverines had lost three of their previous five conference road games including at last-place Penn State on Feb. 12. The moxie they exhibited in taking immediate control and not letting up in what can be one of the conference's loudest arenas will serve them well as they head into March.\n\n\"Defensively right now I think that they understand that this is the one consistent thing we can have every day,\" Beilein said.\n\nMinnesota: The Gophers followed their most complete performance of Big Ten play, a 21-point victory over Indiana on Saturday, with one of their biggest flops of the season.

(AP) \u2014 Players' union head Tony Clark says Adam Wainwright's comments about a possible strike were in line with widespread concern he hears from his members about a free-agent market they claim has become dysfunctional.\n\nStarting his tour of spring training camps, Clark said he isn't drawing conclusions about the market based on Manny Machado's $300 million, 10-year contract with the San Diego Padres, the second-highest contract in baseball history. Bryce Harper, Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel are among dozens of free agents still looking for a deal.\n\n\"We're glad Manny found a home. We're curious as to why it took as long as it did,\" Clark said Thursday. \"And we're also still concerned about the players that are out there that their phone isn't ringing and that they haven't had an opportunity and camps are opened up and the season's opened up and we're in a position where fans and players alike are asking 'Where are we held up and what's going on?'\"\n\nThe former All-Star first baseman, who will visit all 30 teams, said the union has heard from players who have been contacted by multiple teams in a small window of time after going a long period without hearing from any clubs.\n\n\"The idea that there is radio silence for as long as it is and then suddenly the phone rings, all in on one day and that rings from multiple teams, is something we're interested in looking into,\" Clark said.\n\nMajor league front offices are using analytics and models to determine the worth of free agents more than ever before, but that hasn't stopped some of baseball's biggest names from criticizing the decision-making process that left some players out in the cold at the start of spring training.\n\nWashington ace Max Scherzer said there are too many teams trying not to win, and all the rebuilding \"poisons the game.\" Houston right-hander Justin Verlander thinks the current economic approach pursued by some teams will continue to drive away fans.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

Clark said players will honor the current contract, but he understood Wainwright's perspective.\n\n\"The comment that Adam offered suggests the seriousness of what we're seeing and the concern that guys have about where the industry is and where it's going,\" Clark said.\n\nThe union is having ongoing talks with MLB about its concerns. Management wants to install a pitch clock this year and proposed limits on the use of relief pitchers.\n\n\"There's dialogue about a pitch clock, but it's not at the forefront of the conversation because guys wholeheartedly believe that that's not the issue that we have,\" Clark said. \"The issues that we have go far beyond saving a few seconds on any one night in any one game.\"\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nLove or hate his style of play, there's no denying that James Harden is on a historic scoring binge.\n\nAfter scoring 30 points Thursday night, the Houston Rockets star has now scored at least 30 in 32 consecutive games. Harden's streak is the longest since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976-77 and the second-longest all-time.\n\nWilt Chamberlain is the only other player in NBA history to score at least 30 points in 32 consecutive games. The legendary center holds the all-time record with 65 consecutive 30-point games during the 1961-62 season.\n\nThe game is very different now than in Chamberlain's day, so it's incredibly difficult to compare eras. The 3-point line that Harden and his contemporaries have used to transform the game wasn't instituted in the NBA until the 1979-80 season \u2014 seven years after Chamberlain retired.\n\nRather than compare Harden's streak to any of Chamberlain's, or debate whose scoring run is more impressive, let's simply take a moment to marvel at Harden's dominance. Here are some eye-popping numbers from a scoring tear the likes of which we haven't seen in over half a century:\n\n\u25ba Harden is averaging 41.1points a game during his streak. He's averaging 40.6 points over his last 34 games. Only Chamberlain (515) and Elgin Baylor (33) have ever averaged at least 40 points over 33 games \u2014 and no, 515 is not a typo.\n\n\u25ba Harden has raised his season scoring average to 36.5 points a game. In the last 40 years, Michael Jordan is the only player to average more over a season (37.1 in 1986-87).\n\n\u25ba The reigning MVP has scored at least 40 points 18 times during his streak and 22 times overall this season. Anthony Davis and Steph Curry are tied for second in the league this season with seven 40-point games each.\n\n\u25ba Harden has poured in over 50 points four times during his run (five total this season). Eight other players have scored at least 50 in a game this season, and none have done it more than once. With 57 and 58 points in consecutive games Jan. 14 and 16, Harden joined Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to score at least 55 in back-to-back games.\n\n\u25ba As noted, Harden is at the forefront of the league's 3-point revolution. During his 30-point streak, he's attempted 488 shots from long range (15.3 per game), a 32-game total that would rank fifth overall this season. For the year, Harden leads the league in 3-pointers attempted (743, 13.5 per game) and made (276, 5.0 per game).\n\n\u25ba The most polarizing aspect of Harden's game is his ability to draw fouls and get to the free-throw line. He's led the league in free-throw attempts in each of the last four seasons and five of the last six. Over the last 32 games, Harden has attempted 411 free throws (12.8 per game), which would rank fifth in the league. Overall, Harden leads the NBA in free throws attempted (627, 11.4 per game) and made (546, 9.9 per game).\n\n\u25ba The only number that surely matters to Harden is the Rockets' record. Houston is 21-11 in the last 32 games to improve to 33-25 overall. During Harden's streak, the Rockets have moved from 14th place in the Western Conference to fifth.\n\nFollow Matt Eppers on Twitter @meppers_."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/mlb/2019/02/06/mlb-names-you-need-know-2019/2787158002/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/draft/2018/12/30/nfl-draft-2019-first-round-order-cardinals-jets-raiders/2447301002/", "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: We are months away from the NFL Draft but 20 teams are already \"on the clock.\" Here are the prospects you need to know heading into draft season.

USA TODAY\n\nThere was a time when Super Bowl dramatics were few and far between. But for most of the past two decades, the game has usually managed to live up to its perpetual hype. With Super Bowl LIII now in the books, here's our updated all-time Super Sunday rankings (season noted in parentheses):\n\n1. LI (2016) New England Patriots 34, Atlanta Falcons 28 (OT): This game lacked nothing. Patriots QB Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick cemented their legacies, each becoming the first at his respective post to earn five Super Bowl titles. But securing immortal greatness required an all-time performance. Brady threw for a then-Super Bowl record 466 yards, leading his team to 31 unanswered points and earning MVP honors a record-breaking fourth time as New England forged the greatest comeback ever on Super Sunday \u2014 Atlanta led 28-3 in the third quarter \u2014 while taking the big game into overtime for the first time. WR Julian Edelman finally made a miraculous Super Bowl catch that benefited New England for a change. RB James White was the unsung hero, catching a record 14 passes while also scoring the game-tying and game-winning TDs on his way to a Super Bowl record 20 points. Oh, and the Falcons, with league MVP Matt Ryan and Co., sure were impressive on both sides of the ball for nearly three quarters before their epic collapse.\n\n2. XLII (2007) New York Giants 17, Patriots 14: Arguably the biggest upset in Super Bowl history, the Giants derailed New England's march to the still-elusive 19-0 campaign with an unrelenting pass rush, David Tyree's miraculous helmet catch and Eli Manning's MVP performance.\n\nSUPER BOWL: Follow USA TODAY Sports for more stories and analysis\n\nMore: The 53 greatest players in Super Bowl history: Tom Brady stands alone at top\n\n3. XLIX (2014) Patriots 28, Seattle Seahawks 24: It will forever be remembered for Russell Wilson\u2019s goal-line interception with the game hanging in the balance when the Seahawks could have given the ball to bruising RB Marshawn \u201cBeast Mode\u201d Lynch. The loss likely denied Seattle's shot at a dynasty while burnishing the Patriot Way. Brady won a record-tying third MVP award as he and Belichick collected their fourth title together but first in a decade.\n\n4. XXIII (1988) San Francisco 49ers 20, Cincinnati Bengals 16: Probably the first legitimate Super Bowl classic. In what was perhaps Joe Montana's defining performance \u2014 ironically the only time he didn\u2019t win MVP honors \u2014 he led an 11-play, 92-yard drive that culminated with a game-winning TD pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds to go. Jerry Rice's Super Bowl-record 215 receiving yards earned him the MVP award. It was also Hall of Famer Bill Walsh\u2019s final game as an NFL head coach.\n\n5. XLIII (2008) Pittsburgh Steelers 27, Arizona Cardinals 23: It had a little bit of everything \u2014 Pittsburgh LB James Harrison's 100-yard INT return to end the first half, a furious fourth-quarterback comeback by WR Larry Fitzgerald and decided underdog Arizona, and Ben Roethlisberger's laser shot to the back corner of the end zone to toe-tapping MVP Santonio Holmes for the win. The Steelers remain the only team to win six Lombardi Trophies.\n\n6. XXXIV (1999) St. Louis Rams 23, Tennessee Titans 16: The \"Greatest Show On Turf\" scored its third-fewest points of the season, but MVP Kurt Warner's then-record 414 passing yards and LB Mike Jones' tackle of Tennessee\u2019s Kevin Dyson just shy of the goal line on the final play proved sufficient.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby (41) celebrates after breaking up a hail mary pass to the New England Patriots in the fourth quarter in Super Bowl LII at U.S. Bank Stadium. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n7. LII (2017) Philadelphia Eagles 41, Patriots 33: Maybe a nearly six-decade wait between championships and a first Super Bowl crown was almost worth it for The City of Brotherly Love? MVP Nick Foles (373 yards and 3 TDs through the air) led the charge, his 1-yard TD grab before halftime on the now-legendary \"Philly Special\" serving as the indelible sequence. But Eagles DE Brandon Graham basically secured the result by serving up the game's lone defensive highlight with a strip sack of Brady with 2:09 to go. TB12 fired off a game record 505 yards through the air before succumbing on a day when the clubs combined for an NFL record 1,151 yards of total offense.\n\n8. XXV (1990) Giants 20, Buffalo Bills 19: New York played keepaway from Buffalo's explosive K-Gun offense, holding the ball for nearly 41 minutes, and got nice efforts from MVP Ottis Anderson (102 yards, TD) and backup QB Jeff Hostetler. But the Giants only survived thanks to Scott Norwood's wayward 47-yard field goal in the final seconds.\n\n9. XXXVI (2001) Patriots 20, St. Louis Rams 17: In one of Super Sunday\u2019s biggest upsets, few realized this game also represented the beginning of a dynasty, coronation of a genius (Belichick) and birth of an icon as Brady won his first MVP. And there's no forgetting Adam Vinatieri's game-winning, upright-splitting 48-yard field goal at the gun.\n\n10. XLVI (2011) Giants 21, Patriots 17: For the second time in five seasons, New York broke New England's heart as Eli Manning completed another improbable throw \u2014 this time to Mario Manningham \u2014 before the Giants scored a late go-ahead TD and weathered the Patriots' final drive.\n\n11. XXXII (1997) Denver Broncos 31, Green Bay Packers 24: Denver QB John Elway finally got his first ring (on his fourth attempt), though MVP Terrell Davis was the day's star (157 rushing yards, 3 TDs). The AFC also ended a 14-year losing streak to the NFC.\n\n12. XLV (2010) Packers 31, Steelers 25: QB Aaron Rodgers completed Green Bay's four-game run as playoff road warriors with a 304-yard, three-TD effort that earned him the MVP award and a place next to Bart Starr and Brett Favre as a Packers legend while denying Pittsburgh\u2019s \u201cStairway to Seven.\u201d\n\n13. XIII (1978) Steelers 35, Dallas Cowboys 31: In the original Super Bowl shootout, the Steelers became the first team to win the game three times by outlasting a Dallas comeback bid in another memorable matchup full of big plays (mostly Pittsburgh's) and missed opportunities (TE Jackie Smith's drop) that would ultimately doom \"America's Team.\"\n\n14. XXXVIII (2003) Patriots 32, Carolina Panthers 29: One of the stranger games in Super Bowl history \u2014 the teams combined for 61 points despite scoreless first and third quarters \u2014 may be better remembered more for Janet Jackson's infamous halftime show than a pivotal late-game drive led by Brady and capped with more heroics from Vinatieri.\n\n15. X (1975) Steelers 21, Cowboys 17: MVP Lynn Swann only made four catches, but they were laden with drama over the course of 161 yards and a decisive touchdown in a game that would help establish Pittsburgh as the team of the 1970s.\n\n16. XLVII (2012) Baltimore Ravens 34, 49ers 31: A second-half Superdome power outage sparked the Niners, who nearly completed a comeback after finding themselves in a 28-6 hole in the third quarter. MVP Joe Flacco finished one of the best postseason runs by a quarterback, while Ravens LB Ray Lewis earned a second ring in his final ride.\n\n17. XLIV (2009) New Orleans Saints 31, Indianapolis Colts 17: The Saints ended decades of futility courtesy of MVP Drew Brees\u2019 pinpoint passing, coach Sean Payton's surprise onside kick to start the second half and CB Tracy Porter's game-sealing pick six of Peyton Manning.\n\n18. XIV (1979) Steelers 31, Los Angeles Rams 19: Despite winning just nine regular-season games, the Rams gave the Steelers all they could handle before Pittsburgh pulled away in the fourth quarter on its way to becoming the only team to win four Super Bowls in six years. QB Terry Bradshaw was named MVP for the second year in a row.\n\n19. III (1968) New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7: It wasn\u2019t a scintillating game, but it was probably the most important one in NFL history. MVP Joe Namath made good on his pre-game guarantee as New York struck a blow for AFL equality a year before the merger by stunning the NFL\u2019s heavily favored Colts. It remains the Jets' only title.\n\n20. XXXI (1996) Packers 35, Patriots 21: Thirty years after winning the first Super Bowl, the Pack returned to win their third as Gulf Coast native Favre passed for two TDs and rushed for another in front of a New Orleans crowd. However return man Desmond Howard was named MVP.\n\n21. XXXIX (2004) Patriots 24, Eagles 21: New England withstood a late Philly charge \u2014 or did the Pats benefit from a lack of conditioning on the part of Eagles QB Donovan McNabb? \u2014 to become the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years.\n\n22. XVII (1982) Washington Redskins 27, Miami Dolphins 17: MVP John Riggins' 43-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter gave Washington a 20-17 lead it wouldn't relinquish and coach Joe Gibbs the first of his three titles. Riggins finished with a then-record 166 yards, giving him 610 in four playoff games in that postseason.\n\n23. XXX (1995) Cowboys 27, Steelers 17: Dallas survived, thanks to some gift interceptions from Pittsburgh QB Neil O'Donnell, and became the first team to win three Super Bowls in a four-year span. The Cowboys also joined the 49ers as five-time Super Sunday winners.\n\n24. XVI (1981) 49ers 26, Bengals 21: San Francisco launched its dynasty and Montana won the first of his three Super Bowl MVP awards. The Niners hung on thanks in part to a key goal-line stand to thwart Cincinnati, which scored three second-half touchdowns after trailing 20-0 at halftime.\n\n25. XLI (2006) Indianapolis Colts 29, Chicago Bears 17: MVP Peyton Manning earned his only ring with Indianapolis, while Tony Dungy became the first black coach to win on Super Sunday during a rainy night in South Florida.\n\n26. VII (1972) Dolphins 14, Redskins 7: Miami\u2019s \"No Name Defense\" didn't allow a point \u2014 Washington scored on K Garo Yepremian's unforgettable special teams blunder \u2014 as the Dolphins, who entered the game as an underdog, completed the only undefeated season (17-0) of the Super Bowl era.\n\n27. XXII (1987) Redskins 42, Broncos 10: Washington QB Doug Williams struck a social blow as the first black quarterback to win the Super Bowl after orchestrating a breathtaking, 35-point second quarter that saw him throw four TD passes on his way to MVP honors. Timmy Smith rushed for 204 yards, a record that still stands, behind \u201cThe Hogs,\u201d Washington\u2019s famed offensive line.\n\n28. XXI (1986) Giants 39, Broncos 20: MVP Phil Simms had one of the greatest Super Sundays, completing 22 of 25 passes for 268 yards and three TDs, as the Giants rode 30 second-half points to their first Super Bowl triumph.\n\n29. I (1966) Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10: Green Bay, with help from hung-over backup WR Max McGee (138 receiving yards, 2 TDs), did the expected in the first AFL-NFL Championship Game \u2014 that's what the Super Bowl was called at the time \u2014 which didn't even sell out the Los Angeles Coliseum. However not everyone remembers that Vince Lombardi's troops only led by four points at halftime.\n\n30. V (1970) Baltimore Colts 16, Cowboys 13: It was the first Super Bowl with any sense of drama as rookie Jim O'Brien, who had an extra point blocked earlier in the game, drilled the decisive 32-yard field goal with 5 seconds left. But a sloppy game was marred by a rib injury to Colts QB John Unitas and 11 turnovers.\n\n31. LIII (2018) Patriots 13, Los Angeles Rams 3: This one clearly lacked the offensive fireworks that had been a hallmark of the season. But even if there were nearly as many punts (14) as total points in a game where New England matched Pittsburgh with its sixth Lombardi (while putting a dent in L.A. coach Sean McVay's genius label), this matchup wasn't lacking for drama. It was only the second Super Bowl to enter the fourth quarter with the score tied (3-3) though, ultimately, the Rams would match Miami's 47-year old mark for fewest points scored on Super Sunday.\n\n32. XXVIII (1993) Cowboys 30, Bills 13: Buffalo gave Dallas a better fight, leading 13-6 at the half, in a rematch but ultimately couldn't contain league MVP (and Super Bowl MVP) Emmitt Smith (132 rushing yards, 2 TDs). It was the Bills' fourth consecutive Super Bowl loss, a dual accomplishment and curse.\n\n33. XL (2005) Steelers 21, Seahawks 10: Pittsburgh joined the club of five-time Lombardi Trophy winners as RB Jerome Bettis ended his career in style in Detroit (his hometown) and Roethlisberger, 23, became the youngest quarterback to win the game despite forgettable numbers and amid controversial officiating that hurt Seattle.\n\n34. 50 (2015) Broncos 24, Panthers 10: Super Bowl MVP Von Miller (2\u00bd sacks, 2 forced fumbles) terrorized league MVP Cam Newton from the start, triggering a golden defensive effort on Super Sunday's golden anniversary and allowing Peyton Manning to shift into game-management mode as he captured his long-awaited second crown in what turned out to be his final NFL appearance.\n\n35. XIX (1984) 49ers 38, Dolphins 16: A highly anticipated matchup between Montana and Dan Marino fizzled after the first quarter. MVP Montana (331 yards, 3 TDs) completely outclassed fellow western Pennsylvania native Marino (in his lone Super Bowl appearance), as the Niners became the first team to win 18 games in a season.\n\n36. XI (1976) Oakland Raiders 32, Minnesota Vikings 14: At the sun-splashed Rose Bowl, the Raiders won their first title \u2014 and only one under John Madden \u2014 by physically dominating the Purple People Eaters. The Vikings failed to win the Super Bowl in their fourth and most recent attempt.\n\n37. IX (1974) Steelers 16, Vikings 6: After 42 barren seasons, a young Steel Curtain gave Pittsburgh its first NFL title thanks to suffocating defense and MVP Franco Harris' 158 rushing yards, a Super Bowl record at the time.\n\n38. XX (1985) Bears 46, Patriots 10: The upstart Patriots actually led 3-0 before the vaunted '85 Bears defense shuffled its way to a blowout that did not include the touchdown Hall of Famer Walter Payton had long desired.\n\n39. XXIII (1998) Broncos 34, Falcons 19: Elway's final NFL game minted him as an all-time great as Denver repeated thanks to an MVP effort (336 passing yards, TD pass, TD run) from its 38-year-old gunslinger.\n\n40. XXVII (1992) Cowboys 52, Bills 17: Dallas\u2019 Triplets \u2014 MVP QB Troy Aikman (4 TD passes), RB Smith (108 rush yards, TD) and WR Michael Irvin (114 receiving yards, TDs) \u2014 were no match for the Bills (9 turnovers) in the final Super Bowl played at the iconic Rose Bowl. However Buffalo WR Don Beebe\u2019s goal-line strip of DT Leon Lett, who was returning a recovered fumble, prevented Dallas from setting a new scoring record for the game.\n\n41. XV (1980) Oakland Raiders 27, Eagles 10: With the Superdome wrapped in a yellow ribbon welcoming home American hostages from Iran, the Raiders were less than hospitable to the Eagles as they became the first wild-card team to go all the way.\n\n42. IV (1969) Chiefs 23, Vikings 7: In a dominant performance, the Chiefs ensured the AFL-NFL rivalry would forever be knotted 2-2 just months before the leagues officially merged. QB Len Dawson won MVP honors after being erroneously linked to a gambling scandal before the game.\n\n43. II (1967) Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14: The aging Pack won their fifth and final championship of the 1960s in Lombardi's last game with the franchise.\n\n44. XVIII (1983) Los Angeles Raiders 38, Redskins 9: Washington entered the game viewed as one of the most formidable teams of all time. The Raiders put that notion to rest with MVP Marcus Allen (then-record 191 rushing yards) providing the exclamation point with his epic 74-yard TD run.\n\n45. XXIX (1994) 49ers 49, San Diego Chargers 26: No one gave the Bolts a chance, and the Niners proved that outlook correct. MVP Steve Young emerged from Montana's shadow to pass for a game-record six TDs as San Francisco became the first team to win five Super Bowls.\n\n46. XXXVII (2002) Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48, Oakland Raiders 21: It's remembered as the Jon Gruden Bowl after the coach was traded from the Raiders to Tampa Bay before the season. But an elite defense that returned three Rich Gannon INTs for TDs highlighted the only title in Bucs history.\n\n47. XXIV (1989) 49ers 55, Broncos 10: Montana saved his best Super Sunday for last, winning his third MVP with 297 passing yards and five touchdowns as the Niners repeated while setting Super Bowl records for points scored and margin of victory.\n\n48. XXVI (1991) Redskins 37, Bills 24: The game wasn't nearly as close as the score indicates. Washington won its third and final championship under Gibbs, who had a different quarterback each time, including MVP Mark Rypien on this day.\n\n49. XII (1977) Cowboys 27, Broncos 10: In the first Super Bowl staged indoors (the Superdome had been open just three years), Dallas crushed its former quarterback, Craig Morton, and error-prone Denver (eight turnovers). It was the only Super Bowl with co-MVPs (defensive linemen Harvey Martin and Randy White).\n\n50. VIII (1973) Dolphins 24, Vikings 7: MVP Larry Csonka rushed for a then-Super Bowl record 145 yards (QB Bob Griese only threw seven passes) as Miami repeated with a team many considered stronger than the 17-0 group of 1972.\n\n51. XXXV (2000) Ravens 34, Giants 7: One of the most dominant defenses in league history pitched a shutout (the Giants' points came via a kickoff return). Controversy swirled around Lewis all week, but he finished it with MVP honors.\n\n52. VI (1971) Cowboys 24, Dolphins 3: Tom Landry's team finally shed a reputation for choking in big games by holding Miami to the fewest points of any Super Bowl entry on a 39-degree day at New Orleans' Tulane Stadium.\n\n53. XLVIII (2013) Seahawks 43, Broncos 8: The chasm between pre-game expectations and eventual outcome may have been the widest in the game\u2019s history. Seattle's Legion of Boom defense stifled a Peyton Manning-led offense that had scored a league-record 606 points.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis."}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/nascar/2019/01/16/2019-nascar-cup-series-schedule/2509352002/", "text": "None\n\nDates, tracks, times and TV networks for 2019.

USA TODAY\n\nThis year's Academy Awards offers all the traditional reasons to tune in: Glimpses of the world's biggest movie stars preening in couture gowns and borrowed diamonds. Great movies receiving the film industry's highest accolade. Soaring speeches. Stunning upsets.\n\nBut for the 2019 edition, there's an equally compelling reason to watch. It's the final chapter to the year's troubled, turbulent awards season. Live.\n\nThis Oscar season has been so fraught with missteps, backpedaling, Kevin Hart host-canceling, scandal, furor and controversy right up to this moment, that seeing it all come to a head-spinning conclusion in real time on television with a global audience is going to be a must.\n\nAll of that and Lady Gaga crooning \"Shallow\" with Bradley Cooper and Queen playing. I'm so there. With popcorn.\n\nKevin Hart out as Oscars host: Backlash from past homophobic tweets\n\nOscars costume party!: Get up close with iconic outfits from 'Black Panther,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and more\n\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling watch the show backstage at the 89th annual Academy Awards ceremony. (Photo: MATT PETIT/ AMPAS, EPA)\n\nIf Oscar producers Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss can pull off this host-less, ever-changing show with moments of poignancy, emotion and intended humor, they're going to deserve an Emmy, a special Oscar and a guest appearance on \"MacGyver.\"\n\nIt's going to be compelling live television, no matter what.\n\nAdweek reports that advertisers have snapped up the full allotment of commercial time, running at $2.6 million for 30 seconds. Follow the money, because the people spending it know something.\n\nPulling off a host-less Oscars is the biggest hurdle and potentially most captivating scenario, bang at the show's beginning. It's like a figure skater stepping on the ice and attempting a triple axel jump.\n\nKevin Hart will not be hosting the Oscars. No one will be. (Photo: JORDAN STRAUSS/INVISION/AP)\n\nIn 2011, there was a host crisis when Eddie Murphy dropped out in November, before Billy Crystal rode in to save the day two days later. Still, many pondered if there would be enough time to pull off the show, which he did.\n\nHart flamed out of the host job in December following a furor over homophobic tweets revealed from his past. No one else wanted to step into the already thankless job, and the original idea of The Rock as host idea was genius, but he's busy.\n\nThe internet is so hungry for someone to fill the void that it's invented this scenario where Whoopi Goldberg, who's gone missing from \"The View,\" is going to step in. Seriously? But wouldn't that be something?\n\nThe last time we didn't have a host for the Oscars was 1989 and the opening number featured the jaw-dropping scene of Rob Lowe dancing and singing with Snow White on a helium bender. Lowe is still banging his head against a wall about this.\n\nJust seeing how the show's producers handle the lack of host and opening when confronted with this kind of history is going to be worth ensuring you're tuned in before the last A-lister waltzes off the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre.\n\nQueen and Adam Lambert, whose performance was announced Monday with minimal ceremony and confirmed to USA TODAY as an opening act, could make people forget their host problem in one \"We Will Rock You\" stomp.\n\nIs this the real life?\n\nIs this just fantasy?\n\nWe welcome @QueenWillRock and @adamlambert to this year's #Oscars!https://t.co/7uDf42FbjJ \u2014 The Academy (@TheAcademy) February 18, 2019\n\nThen there's the other drama that's erupted this year around the major re-tooling of the show \u2013 revealing an energized, vocal (oh, and did we mention, very famous) Academy membership ready for some argy-bargy. Remember the \"popular film\" Oscar? That proposal was shot down faster than Greedo in \"Star Wars.\"\n\nThere have been other stands and hasty retreats by Academy officials. The decision that only two of the nominated songs would be performed \u2013 \"Shallow\" and Kendrick Lamar's \"All the Stars\" \u2013 led to more umbrage. The Academy flipped to allow all nominated songs to be represented, but wasn't able to secure Lamar's participation because he's out of the country and working on an album.\n\nIn another effort to cut down on the show's run time, the Academy decreed that four awards would be handed out during commercial breaks, then replayed during the broadcast in abbreviated form. Cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short took the hit, and the outcry was sustained \u2013 from Brad Pitt and George Clooney to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nHost Neil Patrick Harris gave it his all in 2015. (Photo: ROBERT DEUTSCH/USA TODAY)\n\nJust two weeks before the telecast, the show's producers were told by Academy leadership that the show would be drastically changed once again by adding the awards back live.\n\n\u201cIt would make for a good story if I had a nervous breakdown,\u201d Gigliotti told The New York Times. \u201cYou find a new way.\u201d\n\nWatching live awards shows, and live TV productions like \"Grease Live,\" multiplies the thrills because there's no safety net. Right now, there are seasoned pros sweating through an already tricky show, one that's constantly changing in light of every new drama. They are so good that we usually only enjoy the slick product. But as Envelopegate showed us two years ago, when the wrong best-picture winner was announced, things can become regrettably, unforgettably unglued.\n\nAnd who knows what other dramas will pop in the remaining time before the show finally starts. It's crunch time, and anything goes.\n\nAwards audiences are already tough and have a chip on their shoulder after fights to preserve their show \u2013 with the wild card of President Donald Trump watching with his thumbs on Twitter as liberal Hollywood steps out.\n\nNot to mention the surprises which will happen and unknowables which have happened before: a streaker, Neil Patrick Harris onstage in his underwear, Jennifer Lawrence tripping up the stairs to receive her award.\n\nAll of this is on top of the vivid plot lines which have emerged this awards season. Popular hits \"Black Panther,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" \"A Star Is Born,\" and \"Green Book\" are in the running for best picture. And who the heck really knows who will win? Spike Lee could take home his first directing or best picture Oscar, Glenn Close could break her streak of being the most nominated living actress without a win. It goes on.\n\nHistory of some sort will be made Sunday. The world waits.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/academy-awards/2019/02/21/oscars-2019-must-see-tv-heres-why/2928073002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/2019/02/22/karl-lagerfeld-draws-self-portrait-his-first-day-fendi/2944834002/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/02/21/judge-confines-antonella-barba-parents-new-jersey-home/2944192002/", "text": "CLOSE Drug deaths in the U.S. have fallen for the first time during the opioid epidemic, according to provisional figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That evening, Parton stood on stage and paid tribute to the man who \u201csaw things in me that nobody else did.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou started my life with my first record,\u201d she said.\n\nIntroducing Parton to the world is just the start of Foster\u2019s accomplishments.

It\u2019s like Orbison said to me one time, \u2018What\u2019s the most important thing we\u2019re going to do?\u2019 I said, \u2018We\u2019re going to eliminate every gimmick you come up with. They don\u2019t endure.\u2019\u201d\n\nFoster was born July 26, 1931, in rural North Carolina. At 15, he took over the family farm when his father died, and moved to Washington, D.C., two years later where his sister lived. Foster wanted to be anything but a farmer, and he started to write songs.\n\nA job in a record store was his introduction to the music business. He was hired at Mercury Records in 1953 and worked his way up to head of national country promotion. After a brief run at ABC/Paramount in 1956, Foster started Monument Records and publishing company Combine Music in 1958.\n\nHe moved the companies to Nashville two years later. Over the next decade, he produced the Orbison classics \u201cOh, Pretty Woman,\u201d \"Only the Lonely,\u201d \u201cCrying\u201d and many others, as well as Parton\u2019s 1967 debut album and her first hit, \u201cDumb Blonde.\u201d He also co-wrote Kristofferson\u2019s \u201cMe and Bobby McGee\u201d and produced his landmark 1970 debut for Monument.\n\nAnother big, albeit brief piece of Foster's legend: he signed a pre-fame Willie Nelson to the label. They released just one single \u2013 1964's \"I Never Cared For You\" \u2014 before Nelson moved on to RCA.\n\nKristofferson's early tunes were published by Combine Music, as was Orbison's \"Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)\" and Tony Joe White's \"Polk Salad Annie.\" Monument's roster also included Jeannie Seely, Ray Stevens, Larry Gatlin & The Gatlin Brothers, Boots Randolph and Charlie McCoy, among others.\n\nCLOSE Record executive Fred Foster speaks after being announced as the next inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

Seely\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me\u201d and Grandpa Jones\u2019 \u201cThe Christmas Guest,\u201d a song Foster helped complete, were at the top of his list.\n\nFoster sold his history-yielding companies in 1990, but his producing career continued into well the 21st century, at the helm of projects by Willie Nelson and Ray Price, as well as 2007\u2019s \u201cLast of the Breed,\u201d which teamed those two legends up with Merle Haggard. His final project was released last year: Dawn Landes\u2019 \u201cMeet Me At the River.\u201d\n\nHe was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame in 2009 and he was given a Trustees Award to honor his career in music from the Recording Academy in early 2016.\n\n\u201cMusically I\u2019m most proud of the relationships I had with the songwriters, artists and engineers,\u201d Foster said in 2016. \u201cThese people are responsible for me being here. I didn\u2019t do it by myself.\u201d\n\nFred Foster checks out his plaque as he was inducted in the Country Music Hall of Fame Medallion Ceremony Oct. 16, 2016.

Vince Gill spoke for them when he officially inducted Foster into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re brave enough and have the courage to stand up in front of someone and do this, every one of us needs a champion,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you look at a man like Fred Foster, and he\u2019s been a champion (for singers and musicians) all these years.\u201d\n\nThe Recording Academy released a statement Thursday marking Foster's life.\n\n\"Fred Foster was a famed producer, songwriter, and music business executive who made a lasting impact in the field of country music,\" said the statement from academy president Neil Portnow. It continued, \"Fred will be deeply missed by many, but remembered as a pioneer within our industry. Our thoughts are with his loved ones during this difficult time.\"\n\nFoster was preceded in death by his parents, Vance Hampton and Clara Marcella (Weaste) Foster, and siblings Albert Glen, Estelle, Charles Vance, Ray, Pauline, Ethel Lou, and Ann. He is survived by his son Vance Foster, and daughters Micki Foster (Greg) Koenig, Leah Foster (Dillon) Alderman, Brit Foster (Judd) Rothstein, and Kristen Foster and grandchildren Rachel DiGregorio, Rhys and Tess Rothstein, and Penelope Kirschner, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nA memorial service is being planned for March.

The thing is, it seems like we should know what he looked like \u2013 the greatest writer in English \u2013 and to many people it probably feels like we do know.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know.\n\nWell, OK, we kind of know. There is one (one!) picture that scholars agree portrays Shakespeare, a black-and-white engraving by a man named Martin Droeshout \u2013 please get in touch if you know how on earth to pronounce that name \u2013 which shows Shakespeare in a big fancy white collar. All modern images of him are variants of this one, in which he looks blandly authorial, gaze disapproving, hairline beating a hurried retreat from his forehead.\n\nDid William Shakespeare look like this, the Martin Droeshout engraving? (Photo: Claudio Divizia, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe Droeshout portrait is what you might call, if you were conversant with the most recent technical terms of art history, \u201cbad.\u201d (\u201cDroeshout\u2019s artistic abilities are typically regarded as very limited,\u201d offers Wikipedia.) There\u2019s no life in the picture, no glimmer of genius.\n\nBut it\u2019s what we have. All that we have for sure, with the exception of a sadly porcine and generic painted bust in a church in Stratford-upon-Avon. Beyond Droeshout, there are only possibilities, guesses, each one more tantalizing than the last. Among these is the Chandos portrait, which shows a dashing, bohemian young fellow with a gold earring \u2013 the Shakespeare we want to believe in.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the many credible choices. Among the less credible ones is the hilarious \u201cJanssen\u201d portrait, which used to look uncannily like the Droeshout engraving, until it was painstakingly restored, when it was revealed to look nothing like the Droeshout at all.\n\nOf the numerous possible portraits, though, only one really captured me. It\u2019s a mysterious picture, held in a private collection in, of all places, Ottawa. It\u2019s called the Sanders portrait.\n\nA woman looks at portraits of William Shakespeare on display at the National Portrait Gallery in London as part of an exhibition, \"Searching for Shakespeare,\" of portraits and manuscripts from Shakespeare's lifetime, in 2006. From left: the portrait known as the Janssen portrait dated 1610. Second from the left, a painting attributed to a little-known artist named John Taylor, dated by experts to between 1600 and 1610, is the so-called Chandos portrait. The painting second from right is known as the Sanders portrait, dated 1603, and the artwork, right, is known as Grafton portrait dated 1588. The Grafton is believed to not show the real Shakespeare. (Photo: SAN TAN, AP)\n\nThe book I was writing when I got so obsessed with these portraits is called The Vanishing Man. It\u2019s a prequel to my long-running (and bestselling! he said proudly) series about an amateur Victorian detective, Charles Lenox, and it is partly about a secret lost portrait of Shakespeare.\n\n\"The Vanishing Man,\" by Charles Finch. (Photo: St. Martins Press)\n\nBeing a prequel, the book features Lenox in his early, scrappy, hungry days in London. I wanted an echo of Shakespeare\u2019s own youthful hunger there; as I say in the book, longstanding tradition has it that the playwright\u2019s first job in London was minding horses outside of a theater, no doubt dying to be inside instead.\n\nThe Sanders portrait became my model. In it, the sitter wears a simple shirt and an open collar; its allure lies not in his garments but in his obvious intelligence, wit, curiosity. His smile is in his eyes, caught in an eternal leftward glance. A label on the back says that it was painted in 1603, the year of the first printing of Hamlet, the year of the plague, the year Queen Elizabeth died. Shakespeare would have been 39.\n\nStare at the picture for hour after hour \u2013 I tacked it over my desk \u2013 and you\u2019ll see the playwright in it.\n\nBut who knows? The beauty of Shakespeare\u2019s work is that he never stays where you left him last, and the same goes for the man. (Did you know that he himself never once spelled his name the way we do?) \"The Vanishing Man\" features a kidnapping and a murder, but its title is actually a play on Shakespeare\u2019s elusiveness. The harder I looked for him, it seemed, the more adroitly he kept vanishing. That hasn\u2019t convinced me to stop looking.\n\nCharles Finch's latest book, \"The Vanishing Man,\" published Tuesday from St. Martin's Press.

The Jackson estate has denounced the documentary for rehashing \"discredited allegations.\" (Jan. 31) AP\n\nPARK CITY, Utah \u2013 Wade Robson and James Safechuck were prepared for backlash when they went up against one of the world's most beloved entertainers.\n\nBut they couldn't have anticipated the level of vitriol leveled at them since last month's Sundance Film Festival premiere of \"Leaving Neverland,\" which revisits their allegations of childhood sexual abuse by \"King of Pop\" Michael Jackson, who settled out of court on similar charges in 1994.\n\nIn the days leading up to the four-hour documentary's first screening, the festival's social media pages were flooded with messages from Jackson's fans, fiercely defending his innocence. Some even made death threats against Robson, Safechuck and director Dan Reed, and others have recently accused HBO \u2013 which premiered the two-part documentary Sunday and continues Monday (8 p.m. EST/PST) \u2013 of paying journalists to slander Jackson, who died in 2009 at age 50.\n\nOn Thursday, Jackson's estate sued HBO over the documentary after repeatedly urging the network not to air the film, denouncing it as \"tabloid character assassination\" by \"two admitted liars.\" (Robson and Safechuck filed lawsuits alleging molestation in 2013 and 2014, respectively. A probate judge dismissed their lawsuits in December 2017 but did not rule on the validity of their allegations.)\n\nMore: Michael Jackson estate slams 'Leaving Neverland'; here's what we learned from watching\n\nRelated: 'Leaving Neverland' director slams Michael Jackson estate: 'They obviously haven't seen it'\n\nStill, the hostility \"hurts less and less as time goes on,\" Robson told USA TODAY in a joint interview with Safechuck last month. \"It's not a great feeling, I'll be honest. But I just keep trying to remember that each and every one of us (as) humans are at our own state of evolution. We can accept whatever we're able to accept based on where we're at in our lives. ... So the people who are choosing to take that nasty, volatile approach to me and James, that's just where they're at right now, and I wish them some peace and less anger in their lives.\"\n\nMichael Jackson, left, with a young Wade Robson, who now claims the \"Thriller\" star sexually abused him for seven years. (Photo: HBO)\n\n'He knew what he was doing'\n\nRobson, 36, born in Brisbane, Australia, was first introduced to Jackson at age 5, after winning a contest to dance onstage with the pop star when his \"Bad\" tour came to Australia in 1987. An avid fan who dressed and danced like Jackson, he was understandably awestruck when the singer invited Robson's family to visit his Neverland Ranch in California two years later. It was then, Robson says, that he first slept in Jackson's bed and was molested by him.\n\n\"He was already a god to me before I met him,\" Robson says. \"Then to get this wild, strange opportunity as a little boy in Australia to be brought together with him and have him tell me: 'You're special. I want to spend time with you. I want you to be my friend and I love you.' This was God, in my mind, saying this to me, and that's where it begins.\"\n\nRelated: 'Leaving Neverland': What we know about allegations of molestation against Michael Jackson\n\nRobson compares the experience to being \"anointed\" by God \u2013 a feeling that Safechuck, 40, echoes as he recounts the first time he met Jackson, on the set of a Pepsi commercial at age 10. Then a child actor in Los Angeles, Safechuck says Jackson became a fast friend: calling his house daily, coming over for play dates and eventually inviting the boy to join him on tour. It was during a trip to Paris that Jackson allegedly introduced him to masturbation while staying in the pop star's hotel room one night.\n\nBoth men say Jackson targeted them specifically after learning that each came from unstable families whose parents fought often. And those parents rarely forbade their children from staying with him.\n\n\"He knew what he was doing,\" Safechuck says. \"He has a way of sensing weakness in families. He has a really good sense of people and can read people really well. First, I think he's physically attracted to the kid, and then he reads the family and just knows how to work it.\"\n\nMichael Jackson performing on his \"Bad\" world tour in 1988. (Photo: Cliff Schiappa, AP)\n\nJackson was allegedly jealous of Sheryl Crow, called her unattractive\n\nRobson and Safechuck each say they were sexually abused by Jackson until age 14. They describe him as being psychologically and emotionally manipulative during those years: He told them he (and they) would go to jail if anyone found out about their relationships, and he ran drills with them to hastily put on their clothes if they risked being caught.\n\nThey also say that Jackson tried to turn them against their families and women and that he listened in on their parents' phone calls while the boys stayed with him at Neverland.\n\nOne time, \"my mom was on a call with her sister talking trash about my dad, and then he was like: 'Look how evil women are. Your dad is a sweet guy. Women are conniving,'\" Safechuck says. \"It was a consistent theme with him.\"\n\nSafechuck recalls being on tour with Jackson in the late '80s, when Sheryl Crow was one of his backup singers. He says his sexual relationship with Jackson had already started but he had simultaneously developed a crush on Crow, who went on to become a pop/country star.\n\n\"Michael was very jealous,\" Safechuck says. \"So one thing he did was he had pictures taken of all of the (backup singers and dancers) before they had their makeup on, but he only wanted Sheryl Crow\u2019s. Then he would show me (the pictures), like, 'Look, she\u2019s not really attractive.' He was also very jealous that I had a girlfriend at school, and that was a point of contention.\"\n\nWade Robson, left, \"Leaving Neverland\" director Dan Reed and James Safechuck pose for a portrait in Park City, Utah, last month. (Photo: Taylor Jewell/Invision/AP)\n\n'He immediately freaked out' after filming alleged sex act\n\nBoth men say Jackson never wore condoms during their sex acts. They say he often plied them with alcohol and pornography before molesting them and even recorded one of his sexual encounters with Safechuck.\n\n\"He immediately freaked out when he realized what he just did and taped over it,\" Safechuck says. Although he was aware Jackson was filming, \"it was fun at the time, and when you're having fun, (Jackson) isn't thinking about it. But later, he's like: 'Wait a minute. I just documented this.' He was very careful, but that was his one sort of slip.\"\n\nOne of the most disturbing anecdotes in \"Leaving Neverland\" is that Jackson allegedly staged a mock wedding ceremony with Safechuck when the boy was 10, exchanging vows and rings in his bedroom.\n\n\"It was more of a reinforcement of: 'Don't worry. We'll always be together. We'll always have this love,' \" Safechuck says. The ring was one of many pieces of jewelry that Safechuck says Jackson gave him, primarily as rewards for sex acts.\n\nDance teacher and Michael Jackson accuser Wade Robson, who went on to choreograph for Britney Spears and *NSYNC. (Photo: Carlo Allegri, AP)\n\n'The sex became the safe zone'\n\nAn aspiring dancer at age 9, Robson and his family moved to Los Angeles at Jackson's urging, after promises he would be the boy's mentor. But once he arrived, Robson says, he saw Jackson increasingly less as the singer moved on to younger boys including Macaulay Culkin and Brett Barnes (both of whom have denied that Jackson sexually abused them).\n\nOn rare occasions when he was invited to stay at Neverland, \u201cthere was an unsaid feeling to be impressive and make it worth his while \u2013 get back into that favorite position in his life,\u201d Robson says. \u201cSo the sex became, in the craziest way, the safe zone, as the rest of the relationship really changed.\u201d\n\nRobson says Jackson kept him and the other boys separated from one another, although he briefly met Safechuck on the set of the \u201cJam\u201d music video in 1992.\n\nThere was no tension or jealousy between them, in part because \u201c(Safechuck) and I were in a similar position at that point, because there was a new boy on the set with Michael,\u201d Robson says. \u201cWe had both been removed from that top spot and were dealing with that in our own ways.\u201d\n\nEven as they grew apart from Jackson, his alleged abuse affected their relationships with women as they grappled with their sexuality and intimacy.\n\n\"I struggled with the 'Am I gay?' thing early on, as soon as the abuse started,\" Safechuck says. \"Michael would say: 'You\u2019re not gay. This is just how we express our love. I\u2019m not gay either, but we love each other.\u2019 As I got older, I didn't struggle or question whether (I was) gay, but your first sexual experience is awkward enough without having been abused. I haven't quite wrapped my head around how it's affected me, but I think I have more nerves with intimate relationships than I would guess other people do.\"\n\nAs Robson moved into adulthood, he says, he \u201cbecame really promiscuous with women. I think I was trying to prove in some sense that I was heterosexual to myself, and trying to prove some sense of \u2018masculinity\u2019 by conquests with women, which was an ultimately unfulfilling experience.\u201d\n\nMichael Jackson was cleared of charges that he molested 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo in a 2005 trial. (Photo: MARTIN CLEAVER, AP)\n\nHealing, forgiveness is a 'really long journey'\n\nAfter years of denying Jackson sexually abused him, Robson came forward with his allegations in 2013 and said he suffered a nervous breakdown brought on by sexual trauma. He later said the singer had \"brainwashed\" him into testifying on his behalf in a 2005 trial. Now married with a young son, he says Jackson's alleged molestation has \"absolutely impacted\" him as a father. (He isn't comfortable leaving his son with a babysitter, for instance.)\n\n\"Our boy has always been similar to how I was as a young boy in a lot of ways, in that he\u2019s more sensitive and quiet,\" Robson says. \"So when I started witnessing that nature in him, I started getting really triggered by that \u2013 understanding now that was some trigger relating to, \u2018Oh my gosh, he can\u2019t be like me. If he\u2019s like me, is the same thing going to happen to him?' \"\n\nSafechuck expresses similar concerns about his son, who is nearly the age that he was when he was first allegedly abused.\n\n\u201cI have been preparing with a therapist for it many years, seeing him at that age, because you\u2019re really looking at a mirror of yourself. How am I going to deal with that?\" Safechuck says. \"But I think I\u2019m in as good a place as I can be to not be triggered by it, and enjoy my experience with him as its own experience. It can\u2019t help but make you more protective and conscious of who they\u2019re hanging out with, and what they\u2019re doing. Hopefully this film will do that for other people.\u201d\n\nTheir wives, moms and siblings all appear in \u201cLeaving Neverland\" and watched the film before its Sundance premiere.

On Thursday, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor staged his attack in order to \"promote his career.\"\n\nIn Trump's post in which Smollett was tagged, the president asked \"what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA\"\n\nSmollett previously told Robin Roberts one alleged assailant used racist and homophobic slurs and said, \"This MAGA country, (N-word).\"\n\nJohnson also said Thursday, the letter threatening Smollett sent to a studio in Chicago which listed \"MAGA\" as the return address, was sent by Smollett himself.\n\nPreviously, Trump condemned the alleged attack, calling it \"horrible.\"\n\n.@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA \u2014 Donald J.

The star previously told police that on Jan. 29, two men attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs and placed a rope around his neck.\n\nThe CNN anchor told viewers he had a 2015 cameo on \"Empire\" and met Smollett then, describing the actor as a fan and \"a very nice guy.\"\n\n\"I know him \u2013 not best friends, but I do know him,\" Lemon added of their current relationship.\n\n\"We shouldn't forget innocent until proven guilty, of course, innocent until proven guilty,\" Lemon said, \"but like I said, a lot of this just doesn't add up. If Jussie's story isn't true, he squandered the goodwill of a whole lot of people. He even lied to a lot of people \u2013 if it's not true \u2013 including me, and that's not cool.\n\n\"He squandered the goodwill of very high-profile people who may one day be running this country like Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and people like President Trump,\" Lemon said mentioning those who spoke out after news of the alleged attack.\n\n\"Like I said, there were questions about Jussie's story from the very beginning, questions he still needs to answer.

And let's be honest, there are probably not a whole lot of MAGA fans watching 'Empire.' \"\n\nLemon also addressed a letter received a week before the alleged attack, sent to the Chicago studio where \"Empire\" is filmed. By Lemon's assessment, the threat with a stick figure drawing and letters cut out of publications \"looks like something out of a bad movie.\"\n\nLemon was perplexed as to why Smollett initially refused to give his phone to authorities. Smollett explained to Robin Roberts in an interview that aired on \"Good Morning America\" Feb. 14 that he was concerned for his privacy, noting the personal nature of items on his phone.\n\n\"Yes, there will be things on your phone that you want to keep private,\" Lemon agreed, \"but if there are also things that prove your story, isn't it worth the handover?\"\n\nSmollett's attorneys,Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, have issued a statement to USA TODAY reminding that Smollett is presumed innocent.\n\n\u201cLike any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.

Here are the events that led up to the \"Empire\" actor turning himself in. USA TODAY\n\nThree weeks after Jussie Smollett said he'd been the victim of a hate crime, the \"Empire\" star found himself in police custody, charged with filing a false police report. USA TODAY looks at the major developments in the investigation into the actor's alleged assault.\n\nJan. 29: Smollett files police report alleging assault on Chicago street\n\nChicago police report to the actor's residence around 2:45 a.m. CT. He tells them he was approached by two men who got his attention by calling the gay, black actor, \"Empire,\" followed by homophobic and racial slurs. He said they then began punching him in the face, placed a rope around his neck and poured a chemical (later revealed to be bleach) on him. Smollett tells police his assailants yelled \"This is MAGA country!\" before running away from the scene. After filing the report, he follows the officer's suggestion to seek medical treatment and goes to the emergency room at Northwestern Medical Center.\n\nJan. 30\n\nPolice release images of 'potential persons of interest': After combing through hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, detectives release several images of \"potential persons of interest\" they seek to question.\n\nThe FBI gets involved: After hearing about his alleged attack, Chicago congressman Rep. Bobby Rush contacts FBI director Christopher Wray requesting that the agency open \"an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack\" on the actor and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker urges his colleagues to support Rush's bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime.\n\nMedia learns FBI is investigating letter received Jan. 22: Chicago police advise media reporting on the alleged assault that the FBI is investigating a threatening letter addressed to Smollett, received at Fox's Chicago studios, where \"Empire\" is based. It contains a white powder later determined to be acetaminophen. The letter's existence and the FBI's involvement do not become widely known until after Smollett files his police report.\n\nDuring a Feb. 14 interview with \"Good Morning America,\" Smollett tells Robin Roberts that he believes the letter is linked to his assault \"because on the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it with the words that said 'Smollett, Jussie you will die,' \" he said, adding that the return address was simply listed as \"MAGA.\"\n\nJan. 31\n\nSmollett\u2019s family calls his attack a 'racial and homophobic hate crime': In their statement, the actor's relatives insist he \u201chas told the police everything\u201d and \u201chis story has never changed,\u201d disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.\n\nFeb. 1\n\nSmollett speaks out for first time since attack: In his first public statement, the 36-year-old actor tells he is OK but expresses frustration with how the case is being reported, saying, \"I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.\" But, he said, \"despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.\"\n\nFeb. 2\n\nSmollett returns to the stage: Less than a week after the attack, he keeps a previously scheduled performance at a Los Angeles club, where he tells fans, \"I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those (expletives) win.\"\n\nFeb. 12\n\nPolice reject Smollett's phone records:Sgt. Rocco Alioto tells USA TODAY that although they appreciate Smollett's cooperation, the phone records he provided \"do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted.\" Smollett's representative, Chris Barstardi, says the actor redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nPolice identify and interview suspects: Chicago police pick up two brothers of Nigerian descent upon their return to Chicago's O\u2019Hare International Airport. During questioning, detectives learn that at least one had appeared on \"Empire\" and carry out a search of their residences.\n\nFeb. 14\n\nPolice deny rumors attack was a hoax: Chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi insists that investigators still view Smollett as the victim of the crime and not a perpetrator while Fox denies rumors that the actor orchestrated the whole thing because he was being written off of \"Empire.\"\n\nSmollett gives interview to 'GMA': In a lengthy conversation with Robin Roberts, he says he is upset with both his assailants and those attacking him in the press: \"It's not that you don't believe this is the truth; you don't even want to see this is the truth.\"\n\nHe also suggests that he would have been taken more seriously if his assailants weren't white: \"It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would\u2019ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.\"\n\nFeb. 15\n\nPolice arrest 'persons of interest': Guglielimi says the two \u201cpersons of interest\u201d are now considered suspects. He says the men \u2013 brothers of Nigerian descent who reside in Chicago and are U.S. citizens \u2013 are in custody but have not been charged with a crime. After being held for nearly 48 hours, the men are released without being charged. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.\n\nFeb. 16:\n\nBrothers say Smollett paid them to stage attack: Police say the investigation has \u201cshifted\u201d after detectives question the two brothers. Police say they\u2019ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett\u2019s lawyers say the actor feels \u201cvictimized\u201d by reports that he played a role in the assault.\n\nFeb. 17\n\nPolice request follow-up interview: Police say they\u2019re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after the brothers told detectives he paid them to stage the attack. He also declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we\u2019ve gotten.\u201d\n\nFeb. 19\n\nPolice dismiss report Smollett was seen with assailants on night of attack: Detectives investigate and then dismiss a tip that the \"Empire\" star was seen with the two brothers in an elevator in his apartment building, saying it was not backed up by video evidence.\n\nProsecutor recuses herself from investigation: Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation due to her familiarity with potential witnesses in the case. She later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported.\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSmollett charged with filing false police report: Hours after a follow-up interview with Smollett's legal team, police classify him as a suspect in a criminal investigation for filing a false police report, and present evidence to a grand jury which approves felony charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.\n\nFeb. 21:\n\nSmollett surrenders to police: Guglielmi confirms, \"Jussie Smollet is under arrest and in custody of detectives\" after turning himself in at a central booking facility. His bond hearing is set for 1:30 p.m. CT.\n\nPolice say Smollett paid brothers $3,500 to stage attack: At a press conference, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that the actor staged the attack to look like a hate crime in order to \"take advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.\"\n\nCLOSE Superintendent of Chicago Police, Eddie T. Johnson, describes how Jussie Smollett's false claims were a slap in the face to Chicago. USA TODAY\n\nHe explained, \"First Smollett attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial homophobic and political language. When that didn\u2019t work, Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack... The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary so he concocted a story about being attacked.\"\n\nPolice:Jussie Smollett staged his attack 'to promote his career,' increase his salary\n\nMarch 8\n\nSmollett indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct and lying to police: A Cook County grand jury handed up charges for each time the actor \"knowingly\" told police that he was the victim of a \"battery, a hate crime and an aggravated battery.\" Prosecutors say he knew at the time \"there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed.\"\n\nMarch 14\n\nSmollett pleads not guilty: The actor returned to court to enter a not-guilty plea and learn the name of the judge handling his case: Steven G. Watkins.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/02/21/jussie-smollett-felony-turns-himself-in-charged-timeline-investigation/2936453002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2019/02/21/playlist-10-biggest-winners-2019-grammys/2930310002/", "text": "CLOSE From surprise appearances to bizarre performances, here are 5 can't-miss moments from the Grammy Awards.

Hannah Gaber Saletan, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Occasionally, his signature appears on court documents. But on the most consequential days of the nearly two-year investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, the man leading it \u2013 Robert Mueller \u2013 has been conspicuously absent.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump's senior aides and confidants paraded through federal courtrooms to face criminal charges his office had filed, the former FBI director was nowhere to be seen. When some of them came back to court to be convicted, he said nothing.\n\nIt's possible he never will.\n\nMueller's investigation has cast a shadow over nearly all of the first two years of Trump's presidency. Prosecutors working to determine whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russian efforts to sway the election that put him in office have brought charges against some of his top aides and revealed extensive Moscow ties. As the inquiry grinds closer to its conclusion, there are signs that the public might never learn the full extent of what Mueller has \u2013 or hasn't \u2013 found.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Click this link on your mobile device to get started\n\nJustice Department rules require that Mueller submit a confidential report when his work is done. William Barr, the man likely to be confirmed as his next boss, cast doubt on whether he would permit that document to be revealed. Those who know him say Mueller, reluctant to speak publicly even when the circumstances seem to require it, is unlikely to do it on his own.\n\n\"A public narrative has built an expectation that the special counsel will explain his conclusions, but I think that expectation may be seriously misplaced,\" said John Pistole, Mueller's longtime top deputy at the FBI. \"That's not what the rules provide, and I really don't see him straying from the mission. That's not who he is.\"\n\nThe Justice Department's special counsel rules don't call for Mueller to make any public statements about his work, let alone deliver a report of what he has found. Instead, his confidential report must explain why he filed the charges he did and why he might have declined to bring charges against others. It would be up to the attorney general to decide whether that becomes public.\n\nBarr, who is likely to be confirmed this month as attorney general, told lawmakers he couldn't commit to releasing Mueller's report in full. Neither was he clear on whether he would permit Mueller to testify to Congress about his work. He said he wanted to be transparent about Mueller's findings but offered few details.\n\n\"Where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and department policy and will let no personal, political or other improper interests influence my decision,\" Barr said during his confirmation hearing in January.\n\nSome lawmakers found the answer unsettling.\n\nAfter Barr's testimony, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., introduced legislation that would require a special counsel to provide a report directly to Congress in addition to the attorney general.\n\nPeople who know Mueller say that unless his bosses tried to derail his work, they would be surprised if the former FBI director did more than issue a brief statement indicating that a report had been submitted to the attorney general before quietly departing.\n\nFor any other major player in official Washington, where outsize egos routinely clash for political supremacy or simple adulation, such a scenario would be unthinkable. But Mueller's aversion to the spotlight has been consistent across a lifetime in public service, from the battlefields of Vietnam to the office that represents perhaps the most serious threat to the Trump presidency.\n\n\"I don't think that there is any chance that he strays from what the regulations say,\" said Chris Swecker, a former FBI assistant director who worked closely with Mueller. \"So far, he has spoken through the indictments and other court documents his office has filed. You have to understand who he is. He will do what the law prescribes; he's not going to be running his own pass patterns.\n\n\u201cNone of this has ever been about his ego,\u201d Swecker said. \u201cHe relishes the work as much as he hates the fanfare. It\u2019s never been about him; it\u2019s always been about the work.\u201d\n\nMeticulous investigator\n\nJust as the FBI, maligned in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, was transformed into his own image as a meticulous investigator, the Russia investigation has come to embody Mueller\u2019s unflagging, buttoned-up personality.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a warm and lovable guy,\u201d Swecker said. \u201cIf you work for him, you are never going to feel appreciated. Things move too fast for that. He believes that you signed up to do a job. And it\u2019s your mission to get it done. He doesn\u2019t like drama.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s team embraced that approach.\n\nHis prosecutors have brought charges against 34 people and three companies, including Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort; his first national security adviser, Mike Flynn; and his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Outside of court filings, prosecutors have had nothing to say about any of them.\n\nWhen the team won a jury verdict after a three-week trial against Manafort, prosecutors retreated to their offices rather than appear at a clutch of microphones outside the courthouse. Asked by email if they had any comment, Mueller's spokesman responded with a single word:\n\n\u201cNope.\"\n\nPistole, who served for six years as Mueller\u2019s deputy at the FBI, describes his former boss as \u201ctotally apolitical,\u201d with an unmatched work ethic.\n\n\u201cFor him, it was about what is right for the country,\u201d Pistole said. \u201cNothing else.\u201d\n\n'Most transformative director since Hoover'\n\nMueller exited the FBI in 2013 as the longest-serving director since J. Edgar Hoover \u2013 amassing a legacy best defined by a grind-it-out style that kept the FBI intact.\n\nMichael Chertoff, a former secretary of Homeland Security, described Mueller in an interview with USA TODAY marking the FBI chief's departure as \u201cthe most transformative director in the history of the FBI since Hoover.''\n\n\"And I mean that in a good way,\" Chertoff said.\n\nCLOSE Robert Mueller will oversee the Russia investigation. Here's a look at his background. USA TODAY\n\nAfter the FBI, Mueller stayed on the public stage but seldom in the spotlight.\n\nAs a partner at the high-powered law firm of Wilmer Hale, Mueller had clients that included some of the most recognizable corporate brands, including the National Football League.\n\nThe NFL hired Mueller in 2015 to examine the league's handling of a domestic violence incident involving then-Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice. When it was complete, the 96-page report, which cleared the NFL of any intentional improper conduct, was simply posted online. No news conference, no public appearance by Mueller to discuss the findings.\n\nMueller was among those Trump interviewed to replace his ousted successor at the FBI, James Comey. Instead, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 to head the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nSince then, the public has had only occasional glimpses of Mueller. One photo captured him waiting for a plane at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, a few yards away from Donald Trump Jr. The photograph went viral, a measure not only of the chance passing of the two potential adversaries but the intense interest in the intensely private man leading perhaps the most widely watched criminal investigation in a generation.\n\nIt was months before Mueller's appointment as a Russia special counsel when Pistole last had an extended visit with his former boss. Pistole said he was surprised to encounter a \"jovial\" Mueller, a feature few have witnessed in such an outwardly serious character.\n\n\"He had been away from government for a while,\" Pistole said. \"He was laughing and joking. I thought: \u2018Who is this guy? What have you done with my director?\u2019 I doubt he's had many moments since he took this job.\"\n\nThe case for saying nothing\n\nBarr suggested that if the Senate confirms him, the public is unlikely to hear from Mueller directly.\n\nBarr, who was attorney general in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has made no secret of his allegiance to the chain of command. In the midst of the 2016 campaign, he objected to then-FBI Director Comey's decision not to recommend criminal charges against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state because he said the decision should have been left to the attorney general or the deputy attorney general, not the chief investigator.\n\nBarr told lawmakers he would \"provide as much transparency as I can, consistent with the law,\" about what Mueller's investigation concludes.\n\nHe expressed doubt about how much detail he would be able to reveal. Justice Department rules require only that he notify Congress about instances in which he had overruled Mueller's decisions about how the investigation should be handled. Some of the facts Mueller has gathered could be the result of grand jury proceedings, which are required by law to remain secret.\n\nBarr pointed to a Justice Department policy to avoid publicizing \"derogatory\" information about people who aren't charged with a crime. Senate Democrats expressed concern that the policy, combined with the department's view that a president cannot be indicted, could lead Barr to keep confidential parts of the investigation that relate to Trump.\n\nThat could in turn set up a battle with congressional Democrats eager to know the details.\n\n\u201cIf the attorney general doesn\u2019t issue a public report, they can expect it to be subpoenaed by Congress because of the high public value of Americans understanding just what the Russians did and who worked with them,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump's lead attorney, has said repeatedly that he fully expects Mueller to produce a final report, indicating that the president's legal team would issue a \"counter-report.\"\n\nLast month, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker raised expectations when he said Mueller's work was \"close to being completed.\"\n\n\"I hope we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon as possible,\" Whitaker said, only to suggest last week in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee that even he wasn't really sure of the timing and hadn't received a report.\n\n\u201cBob Mueller is going to finish his investigation when he is going to finish his investigation,\u201d Whitaker told lawmakers.\n\nSome doubt that a substantial final report from the special counsel is even in the offing.\n\n\"He's a federal prosecutor; they don't write public reports,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor. \"Everybody is breathlessly waiting for the Mueller report, and I'm not sure that one is even coming.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/11/special-counsel-robert-mueller-may-not-say-anything-russia-probe/1422892002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/judge-sabraw-may-order-trump-reunite-thousands-more-separated-families-homeland-security/2943870002/", "text": "CLOSE Amid public outcry over the thousands of migrant children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep families together. Here\u2019s a wrap-up of everything that led to this moment. Just the FAQs\n\nA federal judge appeared poised on Thursday to order the government to fully account for all migrant families that were separated before and after the Trump administration formally announced it's \"zero-tolerance\" policy.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ordered the administration to end the family separation policy on June 26, 2018, and to reunite nearly 3,000 children who were being held in the Department of Health and Human Services at the time of his order.\n\nBut the ACLU is now asking the judge to expand his order to include families that were separated during the previous year, following media reports and an inspector general report that revealed the administration had an unofficial family separation policy in place as far back as July 2017.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Scott Stewart fought back against the ACLU request during a court hearing before Sabraw on Thursday, arguing that the government has gone \"above and beyond\" to facilitate the reunification of thousands of children with their parents rather than fight the judge's order \"tooth and nail.\"\n\nRequiring the government to identify potentially thousands of children that were separated in the previous year, Stewart said, would \"blow the case into some other galaxy\" and could force Justice to take a different approach to the lawsuit.\n\n\"I'm just not sure that we can keep going that way,\" Stewart said.\n\nSabraw explained that the ultimate goal of the lawsuit is to \"bring to light\" the wrongs committed by the administration's family separation policy, even if that requires government agencies taking on the difficult task of poring through records to identify all children that were separated.\n\nHe said his original order only required the reunification of children in government custody at that time because the size and scope of the family separation policy was unknown at that time.\n\nA mother migrating from Honduras holds her 1-year-old child while surrendering to U.S. Border Patrol agents after illegally crossing the border near McAllen, Texas, on June 25, 2018. (Photo: David J. Phillip, AP)\n\n\"No one but a few in the government knew that these separations had been going on nine or 10 months before, and that hundreds if not thousands of children were,\" being separated, Sabraw said. \"The court didn\u2019t know that and plaintiffs didn\u2019t know that, and I don\u2019t think government counsel knew that.\"\n\nSabraw did not rule from the bench, but already started discussing what the next steps could look like.\n\nACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said he was prepared to organize a steering committee of volunteers and pro bono attorneys to help track down all separated parents and children, just as they've been doing to find the more than 2,800 families that have been at the core of the lawsuit. But he said officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which carried out the separations, and the Department of Health and Human Services, which cared for the separated children, need to be involved since they're the ones who hold all the information on each family's case.\n\n\"We are prepared no matter how big the burden is,\" Gelernt said.\n\nSabraw asked whether the government could tap Cmdr. Jonathan White, an HHS official, to lead DHS and HHS in their reunification efforts. White oversaw the government efforts to reunite the original group of 2,800 children, and has drawn praise from the judge, the ACLU and even members of Congress for his work.\n\nAnd while Sabraw said he was not sure how the additional reunifications would eventually be carried out, he said the first step had to be simply getting a full list of every family that was separated.\n\n\"It's important to recognize that we're talking about human beings,\" Sabraw said. \"Every person needs to be accounted for.\"\n\nFAMILIES ON THE BORDER: Despite ban, Trump administration continues separating migrant families at the border in some cases\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/judge-sabraw-may-order-trump-reunite-thousands-more-separated-families-homeland-security/2943870002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/02/21/jussie-smollett-charged-felony-staged-attack-to-promote-career-police-say/2936589002/", "text": "CLOSE Jussie Smollett went from assault victim to suspect within weeks. Here are the events that led up to the \"Empire\" actor turning himself in. USA TODAY\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett plotted an attack to make himself look like the victim of a brutal anti-black, homophobic crime, prosecutors said Thursday.\n\nHe scouted out the exact location with the two brothers he paid to stage the hoax, offered specific instructions on how he wanted to be beaten, and even gave them $100 to buy supplies used in the staged assault, prosecutors said.\n\nThe revelations came as Smollett made his first court appearance Thursday afternoon at a bond hearing following his early-morning arrest on a charge of disorderly conduct by filing a false police report.\n\nJudge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. set Smollett\u2019s bond at $100,000 and ordered him to surrender his passport. No plea was entered and the actor said little other than giving his name. Smollett posted bond late Thursday afternoon and walked out of the Cook County Jail without making comment to a phalanx of reporters.\n\nActor/singer Jussie Smollett (Photo: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nSmollett, who is gay and black, told investigators he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck in the fashion of a noose and poured bleach on him. He also told investigators that the men who attacked yelled, \"This is MAGA country,\" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan.\n\nAssistant State\u2019s Attorney Risa Lanier said Smollett plotted the attack with the brothers, describing one of the men, Abimbola \u201cAbel\u201d Osundairo, 25, as a close friend of the actor's.\n\nLanier gave the prosecution's outline of the incident:\n\nThree men met on Jan. 25 and planned the attack during a conversation in the actor\u2019s car. The attack was originally planned for 10 p.m. CST on Jan. 28, but had to be pushed back a few hours because the actor\u2019s flight from New York was delayed.\n\nSmollett asked the other brother, Olabinjo Osundairo, to \"place a rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him and yell, \u2018This is MAGA country.' \u201d\n\nHe also initially directed the brothers to pour gasoline on him during the attack but later suggested they use bleach, Lanier said.\n\n'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett emerges from the Cook County Court complex in Chicago after posting 10 percent of a $100,000 bond. Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report claiming he was attacked. (Photo: TANNEN MAURY, EPA-EFE)\n\nSmollett and the brothers met again on Jan. 27. The actor picked the men up from their home on the city\u2019s North Side and drove them to the area near his apartment where he wanted them to stage the attack. A witness, an employee of nearby NBC News, saw it all go down.\n\nThe actor instructed the brothers not to bring their cellphones with them. That day he also wrote a $3,500 check to Abel Osundairo that was backdated to Jan. 23.\n\nHe also gave them $100 to buy a ski mask, red hat and other supplies to be used in the attack, Lanier said.\n\n\u201cSmollett also stated that he wanted the brothers to catch his attention by calling him an \u2018Empire' F, 'Empire' N,\u201d Lanier said. \u201cSmollett further detailed he wanted Abel to attack him, but not hurt him too badly and give him a chance to appear to fight back.\"\n\nProsecutors say texts between Abel Osundairo and Smollett show he also provided the drug ecstasy to the actor.\n\nA half dozen people who were identified to the court as family members of Smollett watched the roughly 15 minute hearing.\n\nSmollett, wearing a light black winter coat, watched intently as Lanier detailed the prosecution\u2019s case. At moments, his mouth fell slightly agape as Lanier outlined what they think happened.\n\nJudge Lyke was taken aback by the allegations outlined against Smollett even as he told the actor he has the presumption of innocence.\n\n\u201cThe most vile and despicable part of it, if it\u2019s true, is the noose,\" said Lyke, who is black. \"That symbol conjures up such evil in this country\u2019s history.\"\n\nJack Prior, a member Smollett\u2019s legal defense team, said his client \u201cvehemently denies\u201d the charges and said that the case presented by prosecutors doesn\u2019t jibe with the actor\u2019s character.\n\nHe noted that in his five years living in Chicago, Smollett has become involved in philanthropy and volunteer work, even giving song-writing classes to detainees in the Illinois correctional system.\n\nSmollett's defense team \u2013 which recently added Los Angeles-based celebrity defense lawyer Mark Geragos to assist with the case \u2013 later said in a statement: \u201cToday we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.\u201d\n\nAt a morning news conference, police detailed how the 36-year-old actor choreographed the attack in an attempt to raise his profile.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is also African-American, said Smollett staged the Jan. 29 attack to look like a hate crime, to take \"advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career ... because he was dissatisfied with his salary.\"\n\nSmollett has played Jamal Lyon on \"Empire\" since 2015. Fox said Thursday it is weighing its response.\n\n\u201cWe understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process,\" 20th Century Fox Studio and Fox Entertainment said in a statement. \"We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.\u201d\n\n\u201c\n\nActor Jussie Smollett is seen in his booking photo, taken Feb. 21, 2019, following his arrest on charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report. (Photo: Chicago Police Department via AP)\n\nSmollett could face up to one to three years in prison and substantial fines for disorderly conduct, a charge that \"can mean, say, causing a scene in public,\u201d Adam Citron, a former New York state prosecutor turned defense attorney said. \u201cIn Illinois the law prohibits specific acts that waste public resources or cause unnecessary public fear or stress, and one of those acts is making a false police report.\u201d\n\nSmollett's initial status as a crime victim began to shift last weekend after police arrested and interviewed the Osundairos, who were originally identified as suspects after turning up in surveillance footage. They were seen running from the area, Commander Edward Wodnicki said.\n\n.\n\nPolice learned that the Osundairos, both U.S. citizens, had flown to Nigeria soon after the attack, so officers immediately arrested the men at O'Hare International Airport.\n\nThe brothers were held in police custody for nearly two full days, the maximum police can hold suspects without charging them, before they cooperated with investigators. Their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, told police the brothers were willing to give a video interview.\n\n\u201cIt was at that time that this investigation began to spin in an absolutely new direction,\u201d Wodnicki said.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI is also in preliminary stages of investigating Smollet's role in the threatening letter sent to him at the Chicago studio where \"Empire\" films.\n\nThe letter was sent on Jan. 22, one week before his alleged assault. He could potentially faced federal charges as well, investigators said.\n\nJohnson called on Smollett to come clean. Police did not immediately have an estimate for how much was spent carrying out the investigation.\n\n\u201cAbsolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared, admitting what he did and then be man enough to offer what he should offer up in terms of all the resources that were put into this,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, Carly Mallenbaum\n\nMore: Don Lemon weighs in on Jussie Smollett: 'There were credible reasons to be skeptical'\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/02/21/jussie-smollett-charged-felony-staged-attack-to-promote-career-police-say/2936589002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/steve-king-plans-reelection-bid/2944111002/", "text": "CLOSE Iowa Rep.

Steve King confirmed Thursday that he will run for a 10th term as an Iowa congressman, despite controversies over his history of caustic remarks, including about race and immigration.\n\nThe Kiron Republican has been criticized by national and state leaders of his own party, has been stripped of committee assignments in Congress and has drawn three primary challengers for the 2020 race.\n\nIn a Thursday taping of Iowa Public Television\u2019s \u201cIowa Press\u201d program, host David Yepsen asked him: \u201cAre you sorry for anything that you\u2019ve said?\u201d\n\nThe congressman replied: \u201cI have nothing to apologize for, Dave.\u201d\n\nKing confirmed that he will run for re-election in 2020, despite drawing three challengers for the Republican nomination.

Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa were among the leading Republicans who criticized the remark. U.S. House Republicans stripped him of his committee posts and the U.S. House members, including King, condemned white nationalism and supremacy.\n\nOn the IPTV show Thursday, King portrayed the New York Times passage as a \u201cmisquote.\u201d As he has before, he said he was talking about Western civilization, not white supremacy. King blamed his troubles on media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which he accused of twisting his words and \u201cweaponizing\u201d the language.\n\n\u201cIf you would just hold these publications to what is true, there is no story whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s no part of me that believes in anything that\u2019s advocated by folks that identify themselves as white nationalists or white supremacy.\u201d\n\nYepsen, a former Des Moines Register columnist, challenged King on his claim the quote attributed to him by New York Times political reporter Trip Gabriel was wrong. \u201cHe\u2019s known as a pretty good reporter,\u201d Yepsen told King. \u201c\u2026 That\u2019s one of the reasons why this has had such momentum on it.\u201d\n\nKing replied: \u201cHe can say he\u2019s a respected reporter \u2014 and I think he\u2019s a personable fella; that\u2019s probably part of the reason why we had a 56-minute conversation.\u201d But he said Gabriel never produced a recording or transcript of the interview.\n\n\u201cIowa Press\u201d panelist Erin Murphy, a political reporter for Lee Enterprises, asked King about the effects of being stripped of his committee assignments in Congress after the New York Times story was published. \u201cIs there any way for you to be an effective congressman for the 4th District?\u201d Murphy asked.\n\nKing said he doesn\u2019t think being on a committee matters as much for a Republican now that Democrats are running the House.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s ever going to be a time not to have committee assignments, this time with Nancy Pelosi as the speaker of the House is the time,\u201d he said.\n\n\"Iowa Press\" panelist Kay Henderson, news director of Radio Iowa, asked King about a small Confederate flag that was spotted on his desk in 2016. Critics say the flag\u2019s presence demonstrated his racism.\n\nKing told Henderson he put it there briefly as a sign of his support for free speech amid controversies over whether the Confederate flag could be flown.\n\n\u201cIt stayed there for a few weeks. I took it down. It\u2019s not been there since,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his ancestors included abolitionists and a soldier who died fighting against slavery.\n\n\u201cI understand all of this,\" King said. \"Abraham Lincoln \u2014 his life was all about saving the Union.

Local court officials mistakenly released secret court documents identifying Henderson's occupation and other important clues to a mother-and-son robbery team that he had informed on to police detectives, according to an Arapahoe County, Colorado criminal affidavit released Thursday.\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2016, Henderson, a car mechanic, was shot 10 times and killed in front of the Denver home where he lived with his mother. Prosecutors say the motive for the killing was Henderson's cooperation with detectives in describing details surrounding a marijuana shop robbery two months earlier.\n\n\u201cThis is the nightmare scenario,\" Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said.

That person called Terance Black and told him 'the mechanic' was talking to police, the Post reported.\n\nTerance Black is quoted in the affidavit, saying that he \"got the (court papers) of the guy telling . . . about the robbery.\"\n\nTerance Black told a friend that he had read court papers that pointed to Henderson as a witness and that he \"had been running his mouth . . . Terance Black said he read half of it and Mr. Henderson's name was 'all over it, telling,'\" according to the criminal affidavit.\n\nTerance Black told the acquaintance that if Henderson didn't show up to testify, \"they didn't have a case,\" the affidavit says. \"They could not prosecute them because Mr. Henderson was 'the witness.'\" Black also said that \"we're gonna have to kill him.\"\n\nBoth Terance and Tina Black were overheard at one point saying that Henderson \"had been snitching and snitches get stitches,\" the affidavit said.\n\nThis undated booking photo provided by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office shows Tina Black.

The issue is collectively bargained between the NBA and NBPA, and both sides need to agree to any rule change.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver during 2019 All-Star Weekend. (Photo: Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe timing of the proposal is coincidental in relation to Duke star Zion Williamson\u2019s injury, but his injury re-ignited the debate about one-and-done college players who may otherwise enter the draft after high school rather than spending a season in college and bypassing millions of dollars.\n\nOPINION: Don't blame NCAA after Williamson's injury\n\nOPINION: Williamson should never play another minute with Duke\n\nNIKE: Takes heat after Zion Williamson's shoe failure\n\nAt the July NBA owners\u2019 meeting, Silver told reporters: \u201cMy personal view is that we\u2019re ready to make that change. \u2026 When I\u2019ve weighed the pros and cons, given that Condoleezza Rice and her Commission (On College Basketball) has recommended to the NBA that those one-and-done players now come directly into the league, and in essence the college community is saying we do not want those players anymore. That sort of tips the scale in my mind that we should be taking a serious look at lowering our age to 18.\u201d\n\nWhy the 2022 draft? The league wants to give teams ample time to prepare for the change, and with the NBA submitting a proposal to the union now, it's clear it would prefer to reach an agreement, or at least a framework of the deal, in the next few months.\n\nAs is the case in CBA negotiations, obstacles remain. ESPN reported in October that the NBA wanted agents to provide medical reports on players and mandate attendance and some participation in the draft combine. That would give teams more information to make better selections in the draft. There is some pushback from agents to divulge information, but teams may not be willing to draft a player out of high school without a physical.\n\nBut the union is not opposed to lowering the age limit, and in July, NBPA executive director Michele Roberts told reporters, \u201cStay tuned \u2026 I suspect that we'll have some news in the next few months.\"\n\nBoth sides seem willing to get a deal done, and there is confidence it will get done.

So far, so good.\n\nShe has laser focus, a photographic memory and an extreme eye for detail \u2014 invaluable assets for poring over endless briefs and reports at Miami-based firm Zumpano Patricios.\n\nAnd what's more, she just might be making history: In January, Moss raised her hand, took an oath and became known as Florida's first lawyer living openly with autism.\n\nHer admission to the Florida Bar marked a key milestone in a life filled with them. Moss' diagnosis with autism, at age 3, came with warnings that she might not finish high school, get a driver's license or make a friend.\n\nThe Parkland native did all those things and more, earning two bachelor's degrees \u2014 in criminology and psychology \u2014 by age 20 before graduating from the University of Miami School of Law in May 2018.\n\nZumpano Patricios now calls Moss \"one of the first documented autistic attorneys to join the Florida Bar and a major law firm,\" though firm co-founder Joe Zumpano believes \"she may be one of the first nationally.\"\n\n\"I hired her the moment I met her,\" said Zumpano, who has a 16-year-old son with autism. In Moss, he saw \"a brilliant person with a brilliant mind.\"\n\nAt the firm, Moss specializes in anti-terrorism and healthcare, fields that entail massive swaths of information. Cases can have a million documents, and Moss is tasked with remembering names, bank accounts and relationships along with deciphering \"the games that are played\" in healthcare cases, Zumpano said.\n\n\"So when you\u2019ve someone with an exceptional memory ability and an exceptional ability to connect people, places and things, that\u2019s a tremendous asset for any law firm,\" he said. \"And Haley brings that to the table.\u201d\n\nHaley Moss speaking at her law school's commencement ceremony at the University of Miami in 2018.

It's not the job that's proved hard for her.\n\n\"The things that are hardest for me are actually outside of the office, such as driving and daily living skills,\" she said. \"Starting a career is a huge transition for anybody, but is monumental for autistic people as it means we have to establish new routines.\"\n\nMoss didn't use words until around age 4, a common symptom of autism. When she did speak, much of it was echolalia, an echoing repetition of others' words. \"Kind of like a parrot,\" she said.\n\nShe could, however, put together 100-piece puzzles as a toddler. Her mother told her: \"Different isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s just different, and different can be extraordinary.\u201d\n\nMoss realized the power of her voice as a teen, when she spoke at an Autism Society of America event and saw how her story encouraged others.\n\nShe's since penned two books on her experiences: \"Middle School \u2014 The Stuff Nobody Tells You About: A Teenage Girl with ASD Shares Her Experiences,\" and \"A Freshman Survival Guide for College Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders.\"\n\nMoss' mother taught her to embrace her diagnosis. She learned her weaknesses, but also her strengths. She became more self-aware, more confident, she said, until she pursued law \u2014 a profession that leveraged her skills, her love of writing and her desire to help people.\n\nHuge companies have taken steps to hire workers with autism in recent years, including JP Morgan, Microsoft, Ford and Ernst & Young, CBS reported last year.\n\nZumpano hopes Moss' story can show that just because someone \"is neurologically diverse doesn\u2019t mean that they may not have strengths greater than our own.\u201d\n\nFollow Josh Hafner on Twitter: @joshhafner\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nHow an 11-year-old boy's amazing crochet skills quiet his busy mind\n\nTeen offered full ride to 20 universities, including four Ivy League schools\n\n\n\nLeon Patricios, Judge Lisa Walsh, Rick Moss, Haley Moss, Sherry Moss and Joe Zumpano at Haley Moss' ceremony in January.

If your number matches the hotel where we know he stays, then we will put you on the radio.'

Then he enters and engages in \"shocking sexual misconduct while his alleged victims are incapacitated and unable to provide any meaningful consent to his sexual advances,\" Allred said.\n\n\"To R. Kelly I am sending this message: You have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide,\" Allred said. \"Your victims are now surrounding you and crying out for justice. \u2026 It is time for you to face the consequences of what you have done in our system of justice.\"\n\nAllred said her two clients, as well as others of her clients, are afraid that their alleged encounters with Kelly were recorded and that old videos may now be circulating without their consent.\n\nAttorney Michael Avenatti handed over two tapes of Kelly to Chicago police, one of which has resulted in 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against the R&B star.\n\nSteve Greenberg, Kelly's Chicago attorney, did not return a message from USA TODAY.

Few images had captions to provide names or context and people\u2019s faces were often hidden behind hoods or blackface.\n\nIn one yearbook, from Arizona State University, reporters discovered that USA TODAY Editor Nicole Carroll had designed a page that included a photo of two people, at a fraternity\u2019s Halloween party, in black makeup as actress Robin Givens and boxer Mike Tyson. Carroll, who was editor of the yearbook in 1989 when the photo ran, expressed regret after learning of the photo.\n\nExperts say that even if school officials don\u2019t have direct oversight over the yearbooks, responsibility rests with the entire institution: A campus culture that fostered racist behavior; yearbook staffs that chose to memorialize it; and administrations that failed to condemn the images when they were published for the world to see.\n\nFollow Natalie Allison on Twitter at @natalie_allison\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/21/bill-lee-tennessee-governor-auburn-yearbook-confederate-yearbook/2945368002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/north-carolina-voter-fraud-charges-dog-house-race-mark-harris/2938521002/", "text": "CLOSE A new election in a North Carolina congressional race was ordered after the Republican candidate conceded that his apparent victory was tainted by evidence by ballot-tampering by political operatives working for him.

The allegations led to charges of ballot tampering.\n\nPolitical operative Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr. stands outside his home in Bladenboro, North Carolina, on Dec. 5, 2018.

But it took a turn after charges of voter fraud surfaced.\n\nThe State Board of Elections didn\u2019t certify the election.\n\nThe North Carolina race was one of several that raised concerns about voter fraud and voter suppression by Democrats and civil rights groups.

What is this always-fatal condition and how do people fight its spread? Wochit-All\n\nAs people wonder what might happen if humans eat meat from \"zombie\" deer, there is at least one group of people who already know.\n\nOn March 13, 2005, a fire company in Oneida County, New York, fed the meat of a deer that tested positive for chronic wasting disease to 200 to 250 people. The company didn't know the meat was from a diseased deer. Laboratory tests for one of the deer served came back positive for CWD later.\n\nBecause little was known about what happens to people who eat infected meat, the Oneida County Health Department monitored the group's health through a surveillance project. About 80 people who ate the venison agreed to participate. Together with the State University of New York-Binghamton, health experts checked in with the group of mostly white males over the course of six years to see whether they developed any unusual symptoms.\n\nStart the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing delivered to your inbox\n\nIn a study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Public Health, researchers found the group had \"no significant changes in health conditions.\" They did report eating less venison after the whole ordeal. Otherwise, observed conditions, including vision loss, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, weight changes, hypertension and arthritis, were credited to old age.\n\nMore: Will deer with chronic wasting disease attack humans?\n\n\"It\u2019s the only study I\u2019m aware of that has this progressive follow-up of a known point source contamination where we know the people ate a contaminated animal,\" researcher Ralph Garruto, professor of biomedical and biological sciences at Binghamton University, told USA TODAY.\n\nGarruto said his team checks in with the group every two years and plans another follow-up in spring. Though he said the chance of symptoms appearing dwindles with time, there's a small possibility that someone might show signs of the disease.\n\n\"It only takes one case,\" he said.\n\nChronic wasting disease is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, reindeer, sika deer and moose.

Without them, she couldn't undergo lifesaving surgery. After azcentral investigated, she received good news. Rebekah L. Sanders, The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nPHOENIX \u2013 Caitlin Secrist, a 21-year-old college student blocked from lifesaving surgery because she can't get copies of her medical records, will receive the file after Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and a judge intervened Wednesday.\n\nSecrist can't eat, can't work, delayed her college graduation and is in constant pain because of acute pancreatitis. She wears a feeding tube around the clock and depends on handfuls of medications. More than a dozen hospitalizations later, the next pancreatitic attack could kill her.\n\nAll conventional treatments have failed. Secrist hopes a drastic surgery to completely remove her pancreas, spleen and appendix could help.\n\nBut a top doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital refuses to perform the operation without a complete understanding of Secrist's health history, including what her organs looked like when she was originally diagnosed, she said. Without the first scans taken in 2017, Secrist can't move forward.\n\nCaitlin Secrist, 21, and her parents Suzette and Bill are struggling to get Caitlin's medical records from a bankrupt Arizona hospital. On Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2019, a judge ruled that the way to get the records was to use the hospital's remaining assets. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)\n\nSecrist is among more than 300 patients who have tried and failed to get their medical records since Florence Hospital at Anthem and Gilbert Hospital went bankrupt and closed last summer, The Arizona Republicreported. Creditors have been bickering since then over who should cover the $92,000 needed to access the repossessed electronic-records system.\n\nFeb. 20: College student could die because she can't get copies of her medical records\n\nFeb. 11: Apple lets veterans track their health records on the iPhone\n\nAfter reading the Republicstory, Ducey directed his staff to see whether they could help Secrist obtain her records. Their efforts are underway.\n\n\"We've spoken with the patient's family and other outside organizations that could help with this to find any avenue possible to get these records to her,\" said Patrick Ptak, a spokesman for the governor.\n\nPleading her case in court\n\nSecrist and her parents drove an hour and a half from their Florence, Arizona, home to a court hearing on the impasse Wednesday, hoping to speak to the judge.\n\nSecrist had penned a heart-wrenching letter to Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Roger Brodman the day before. Her doctor also wrote the court, saying that Secrist was in \"dire need\" of the records.\n\nBrodman considered competing proposals to resolve the situation:\n\nMake patients pay potentially thousands of dollars for their records.\n\nSend the bill to former hospital executives.\n\nForce the electronic-records company to shoulder the costs.\n\nDig into hospital assets that otherwise would go to the senior creditor, a New York investment firm, which opposed the plan.\n\n\"Everybody agrees this is a critical issue,\" Brodman said. \"The hospital has the duty to produce the records. The inherent problem here is there is no hospital. The hospital has gone kaput.\"\n\nSecrist didn't get to speak during the court proceedings. But as it turned out, the judge didn't need Secrist's encouragement.\n\n\u201cEverybody agrees this is a critical issue. The hospital has the duty to produce the records. The inherent problem here is there is no hospital. The hospital has gone kaput.\u201d Judge Roger Brodman\n\nBrodman ruled quickly that the most efficient, fastest and probably least expensive option was to use remaining hospital assets.\n\nThat plan will reactivate the electronic-records system for 90 days, launch a publicity blitz to alert patients and hire employees to collect the records and respond to requests.\n\nIndigo-DLI Holdings, the New York lender that opposed the plan because it would eat into the money it would recoup from the hospitals, may appeal to stop the plan, attorney Kyle Hirsch said in court.\n\nHe was the only attorney in the lawsuit that has not expressed sympathy for patients.\n\n\"This is a very important issue,\" Hirsch told the judge. \"If the patients want their records they should pay a reasonable fee. ... But imposing the entire expense on Indigo doesn't seem fair.\"\n\nFor now, the plan will move forward.\n\nNext steps for patients\n\nIf all goes well, Secrist can expect to receive her file in two to three weeks, attorneys said.\n\nShe could get the records even faster if Ducey's office can locate her files through a third-party records vendor the state has a relationship with.\n\nAny patients who need records from Florence and Gilbert hospitals \u2014 and have not already requested them \u2014 should do so as soon as possible.\n\nThe window of opportunity to receive records is expected to be roughly March through May.\n\nCLOSE Caitlin Secrist is in constant pain from a severe illness, pancreatitis. And now she could die because she can't get copies of her medical records. Arizona Republic\n\n'It's a good feeling'\n\nSecrist and her parents said the decision was a \"big win\" for her and hundreds of other patients.\n\n\"It's a good feeling,\" Secrist said outside the courthouse. \"I can finally get those records and get on my way to getting better.\"\n\nAn aspiring nurse, Secrist hopes to schedule her surgery soon so she can get back to school and a more normal life.\n\nJan. 17: Johnson & Johnson teams with Apple study to help reduce the risk of strokes\n\nNov. 11: A $35,000 kidney stone?

It was way more than I expected.\"\n\nSolutions to broader problem\n\nSecrist's case poses the wider question of why Arizona patients were put at risk at all.\n\nDisputes between health care facilities and software and server companies over billing, access and obligations to patients have cropped up as medical records across the country have been moved online. There are not always clear answers in current federal and state law.\n\nFor instance, attorneys for Medhost, the electronic record company used by Florence and Gilbert hospitals, argued that it is not a \"health care provider\" and thus was not subject to records-retention regulations that apply to hospitals and doctors.\n\nAnd the Arizona Department of Health Services declined to intervene in the case despite requests from attorneys. It's not clear why.\n\nThe Governor's Office hopes to review state laws for possible loopholes that contributed to the quagmire, Ptak said.\n\n\"We are open to discussions about how to prevent something like this from happening in the future if a hospital were to close,\" he said.\n\nFollow Rebekah L.

Incarcerated people across the country are routinely subjected to inhumane conditions.\n\nIn Mississippi, the state Department of Corrections was sued last year over extremely inhumane conditions that people were forced to endure for years, including excessive force and poor mental health care.\n\nYet another lawsuit was filed in Flint, Michigan. It stated that prison officials refused to hand out bottled water to and instead forced people locked up in the Genesee County Jail to drink tap water after they knew it was contaminated with lead.\n\nThese types of abuses are exacerbated in times of extreme weather. In 2017, incarcerated people at the Federal Correctional Institute in Beaumont, Texas, were left in their cells as the city flooded during Hurricane Harvey.\n\nIn South Carolina, Hurricane Florence prompted massive evacuations, yet reports showed that state officials chose not to evacuate some prisons in the hurricane\u2019s path. In Arizona, the Phoenix New Times reported that during the Summer of 2017, indoor temperatures in many Arizona prisons reached more than 100 degrees, with some temperatures rising as high as 113 degrees.\n\nFarther north, on Rikers Island, an infamous set of New York City jails, people have endured temperatures above 100 degrees with no central air in the summer and freezing cold temperatures in the winter. The air quality on Rikers has made people sick as the infrastructure built atop a landfill deteriorates. When Hurricane Sandy struck New York, incarcerated people were not evacuated from the sinking island. Dangerous conditions, exacerbated during extreme weather, remain a primary reason the entire 10-jail facility must be closed.\n\nInhumane penal conditions date to the beginnings of incarceration in America. In the 19th century, prisons were used as a new means for housing black people and forcing them, after slavery ended, to continue to provide free labor. The 13th Amendment banned involuntary servitude except as punishment for criminal conviction.\n\nOther nations do better, so can we\n\nLast year, JustLeadershipUSA joined a delegation of U.S. criminal justice reform organizations and corrections professionals who visited prison facilities in Germany and Norway.\n\nThe basic human rights of people in those institutions were respected. They were housed in clean facilities with access to good medical care and educational and recreational opportunities. They were given private time with their families as a matter of routine. The facilities were climate controlled; deprivation of heat was never a concern.\n\nConditions in the United States can and should be better. We cannot denounce human rights violations beyond our borders while tolerating and permitting such atrocities domestically. Surely, we can effectively protect incarcerated people from life-threatening weather, drinking water contamination and other appalling conditions.\n\nRaising awareness and publicly denouncing human rights abuses such as those that took place most recently in Atlanta and Brooklyn is important. But as long as our country sees incarcerated people as second-class citizens undeserving of human dignity, we will never address the ongoing pattern of racial injustice, negligence and dehumanization.\n\nDeAnna R.

But I want to ask everyone feeling angry, hurt and disappointed to channel those emotions into productive activism \u2014 because there are thousands who are targeted by hate violence each year who need our help.\n\nThe rising tide of hate violence has had a devastating impact on black people, LGBTQ people, religious minorities and those living at the intersections. At least 26 transgender people were killed in 2018 alone \u2014 and many were clearly bias-motivated crimes.\n\nStopping the epidemic of hate violence will require concrete action from lawmakers through improved and mandatory reporting of all hate crimes (hate crime reporting by local authorities is voluntary), passage of state laws that protect LGBTQ people, and expanded education and training for law enforcement. It also requires that we create a climate where survivors are believed and empowered to come forward knowing their crimes will be thoroughly investigated.\n\nPlease join me in calling for action on policies that can end this scourge of violence and calling attention to people impacted by hate violence already this year:\n\n\u25baLast month in Houston, Candice Elease Pinky \u2014 a black trans woman \u2014 was chased down, shot several times in broad daylight, and left in a gas station parking lot.\n\n\u25baElizabeth Cole, a transgender woman from, Henderson, Nevada, was shot in the neck by her neighbor.\n\n\u25baIn Austin, Texas, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry \u2014 a gay couple \u2014 were severely beaten outside a bar.\n\n\u25ba In Montgomery, Alabama, Dana Martin \u2014 a black trans woman \u2014 was found brutally murdered, and officials continue to misgender her to the public.\n\nChad Griffin is president of the Human Rights Campaign.

If it\u2019s true that Smollett staged this attack, he will have made it all the more challenging for the next actual victim of such violence to be heard and believed.

It's unfortunate if anyone, especially someone with this large of a platform, would falsify any parts of a story of hate violence. Still, the reality is that far too many survivors aren't believed and don't get justice for the violence they experience. That's why we are quick to affirm and believe survivors when they share their stories.\"\n\nMegan McArdle, The Washington Post: \"Bogus attacks may feel more authentic than actual ones because, luckily, most of us know these extreme forms of violence only from what we\u2019ve seen on-screen. We amplify stories that tickle our narrative neurons, overlooking more complicated real attacks where the significance must be explained. This does a grave disservice to real victims.

If only I could have been as courageous in acknowledging them in our yearbook.\n\nIf you are a white southerner like me, you might have done what I did last week. I pulled my dusty yearbooks off the shelf to look for pictorial evidence of the racism that pervaded my childhood in Jackson, Mississippi. This I did with a heightened trepidation, because I was the editor of my 1966 high school yearbook.\n\nThere were no blackface photos, thank goodness. But I found something I'm ashamed of all the same.\n\nBeing named yearbook editor was important to me, but it was not the most life-changing thing that happened my senior year. For that, I credit eight classmates who bravely followed in the footsteps of the more famous Little Rock Nine, who desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957.\n\nUSA TODAY editor in chief: I became part of our story on racist images in college yearbooks. I'm here to apologize for publishing that photo\n\nThe \u201cMurrah High School Eight,\u201d as we called them, came along almost a decade later, because Mississippi officials more fiercely resisted the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate that separate was not equal. For that reason, I attended segregated public schools for 11 grades \u2014 all while Brown v. Board of Education was supposed to be the law of the land.\n\nSchool integration in 1960s America\n\nMy parents taught me this was wrong, so as a teenager I started getting quietly involved in the civil rights movement \u2014 working, for example, as a teacher aide in the first Head Start program in the 1960s. That\u2019s how I got invited by the local NAACP chapter president to meet with the Murrah Eight before school started.\n\nThe author's yearbook of the 1965-66 school year. (Photo: Family handout)\n\nThey wanted to know what to expect, and frankly, I was terrified for them. The best they could expect was to be ostracized by almost everyone, to be excluded from all activities except their classes, to be ignored or bullied by some teachers who had made their racist views well known to us white students.\n\nRead the USA TODAY investigation: Blackface, KKK hoods and mock lynchings: Review of 900 yearbooks finds blatant racism\n\nI tried not even to imagine what might be the worst they could expect. It was 1965. This was barely a year after the murders and church bombings of Freedom Summer, and just two years after Medgar Evers was gunned down in his driveway a couple of miles from my home.\n\nI could not imagine having their sheer courage. As the first day of school approached, I took to praying for them every night. I was praying for me, too. I was praying I might have the courage \u2014 just a small fraction of theirs, of course, but enough to stand up for my convictions on that first day of school, enough to openly welcome my new classmates, to sit with them at lunch, to be shunned by my friends and maybe worse.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nVirginia's blackface meltdown shows how slavery and tribalism still warp our politics\n\nWhy politicians shouldn't always be purged over past blackface incidents\n\nI did muster the courage of my convictions that day, but as for my eight new classmates, they endured a miserably difficult senior year. My friend Brenda White Swaggard told me recently \u2014 a full half-century later \u2014 that sometimes the psychic wounds still feel fresh. But Brenda and all the Murrah Eight persevered to become my high school\u2019s first black graduates.\n\nOmitted from the yearbook \u2014 yet another insult\n\nTheir courage inspires me to this day. Indeed, I credit their example for setting me on my life course as a civil rights and civil legal aid lawyer.\n\nSo my heart sank last week to be reminded that the story of the Murrah Eight is nowhere to be found in the pages of the yearbook I edited. Some of their photos are in the \"seniors\" section of the yearbook, but nothing explicit about their heroism or their challenges. A few vague references in the opening photo essay \u2014 to the effect that \u201cMurrah faced changes\u201d in the \u201cgreat national quest for civil rights\u201d \u2014 were all I dared submit for approval to my faculty sponsors. I might have been right that they would have rejected any more explicit reference to the most momentous thing that happened to us that year, but I didn\u2019t make the ask.\n\nSure, no blackface photos, but there is more than one way for a yearbook to do damage.\n\nIt is too late to re-edit old yearbooks. But as events of recent weeks attest, it is high time to unearth the stories that still need telling and to rededicate ourselves to our longstanding quest to eliminate race discrimination root and branch. It is a quest both national and personal.

(Feb. 21) AP\n\nPope Francis urged high-ranking church officials from around the globe gathered Thursday at the Vatican to \"hear the cry of the little ones\" who are victims of sexual abuse by priests.\n\nFrancis spoke at the beginning of a four-day summit that brought together almost 200 high-ranking church officials, including leaders of bishop conferences from more than 100 nations. The summit will focus on making bishops aware of their responsibilities regarding sexual abuse, as well as accountability and transparency, the Vatican said.\n\nThe pope cited the \"scourge\" of sexual abuse and said it was the responsibility of church leaders to \"confront this evil afflicting the Church and humanity.\"\n\nFrancis offered 21 proposals for the clergy to weigh. Some would require new laws; others would be easier to adopt.\n\n\"The holy people of God look to us and expect from us not simple and predictable condemnations but concrete and effective measures to be undertaken,\" he said. \"We need to be concrete.\"\n\nThe summit began with an African woman who was not identified recounting how her priest raped her and forced her to have three abortions over a dozen years after he started violating her at age 15.\n\nIt ended with Colombian Cardinal Rub\u00e9n Salazar G\u00f3mez warning the clergy that they could all face prison if they let such crimes go unpunished.\n\nLast week, Francis defrocked former U.S. cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88, after Vatican officials found him guilty of sex crimes against minors and adults.

He vowed to demand accountability from church leadership.\n\nAmong the proposals Francis offered were protocols for accusations against bishops \u2013 a reference to the McCarrick scandal \u2013 and directions for transferring seminarians or priests to prevent predators from moving freely among parishes.\n\nPope Francis attends the opening of a global summit aimed at protecting children from sexual abuse.

That vehicle, which had four occupants, lost control and crashed into a guard rail about four miles east of downtown Syracuse.\n\nThe car, a black Dodge Charger, was perpendicular to the roadway and blocking the center lane and most of the left lane, police said. The occupants of the car exited the vehicle after another vehicle swerved to avoid hitting the Charger.\n\nThat convinced them to try to walk across the roadway to safety. Boeheim, who was driving a GMC Acadia, struck Jimenez as he stood near the side of the road.

Susan Page explains. USA TODAY\n\nAnd then there were 10.\n\nOfficial Democratic presidential contenders, that is. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy Tuesday morning, adding a prospect who at 77 is not only a generation older than most of the other hopefuls but also the only one with the experience of having run for president before.\n\nSanders\u2019 bid stuns no one, given his challenge to Hillary Clinton for the nomination in 2016 that turned out to be more formidable than most pundits predicted. But there have been surprises in what is likely to be biggest presidential field in American political history unfolds.\n\n1. It\u2019s a different Democratic Party\n\nCLOSE Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders announces his entry into crowded 2020 Democratic field for President. USA TODAY\n\nBernie Sanders lost the nomination last time around, but he won the party.\n\n\"We were told that our ideas were radical and they were extreme,\" Sanders said in his announcement video, underscoring the point by making quotation marks in the air around the derisive adjectives. \"Well, three years have come and gone, and as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.\"\n\nProposals he made that seemed controversial then \u2014 Medicare For All, which Hillary Clinton had dismissed as a pipe dream, and free tuition at public colleges \u2014 are now in the Democratic mainstream as the ideological center of the party has moved left. Indeed, progressives now looking for a champion have choices this time beyond Sanders, who describes himself as a Democratic socialist.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris says she\u2019s open to eliminating all private health insurance if a single-payer, government-run system could be created. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, decrying an economic system that she argues is \u201crigged\u201d against working people, is calling for a populist \u201cwealth tax\u201d on the rich, a 2 percent charge on the holdings of those who have more than $50 million in assets.\n\nThat said, cracks are forming among the candidates over just how far left to go, especially as Trump paints the opposition party as radical socialists who would threaten traditional American values. \u201cThey\u2019re slipping extremely far left,\u201d the president warned at a Cabinet meeting last week. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that to happen to our country.\u201d\n\nThe ambitious \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d a nonbinding resolution unveiled by freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and veteran Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey, could become a wedge between those who view it as an agenda and those who see it as an aspiration. It includes provisions to not only to address climate change but also to broaden the social safety net for Americans.\n\n\"I will tell you, I'm not a Democratic socialist,\" Harris told reporters in New Hampshire Monday. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., also sounded a note of caution, calling the Green New Deal \"the right place to begin.\"\n\n2. The candidates are more diverse\n\nPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., answers questions from Iowans on Saturday, Feb. 9, 2018, in the living room of a home in Johnston. Buttigieg is exploring a run for president. (Photo: Kelsey Kremer/The Register)\n\nHere\u2019s another surprise: Of the 10 formal candidates so far, only two are straight white men. Put another way, eight of the 10 don\u2019t fit the mold set by 43 of the previous 44 U.S. presidents. Four are women. Two are African-American. One is Hispanic. One is openly gay.\n\nButtigieg \u2014 who finesses the challenge of pronouncing his last name by introducing himself as \u201cMayor Pete\u201d \u2014 exemplifies the redefinition of who could be seen as a credible contender. For one thing, he\u2019s 37 years old; the youngest president, Teddy Roosevelt, was 42 when he took office. For another, Buttigieg is not a prominent senator or a governor but rather the mayor of a city of 102,000 Hoosiers. And he\u2019s gay.\n\nHe has a standard response when interviewers ask him if America is ready to elect a gay president. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out,\u201d he replies.\n\nBy the way, his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, has suggested pronouncing it \u201cboot-edge-edge.\u201d Or possibly \u201cbuddha-judge.\u201d Or maybe \u201cboot-a-judge.\u201d\n\nMore: Who is running for president?

Standing in the snow can be smart politics\n\nFormer vice president Walter Mondale told Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar he couldn\u2019t quite believe she had scheduled her campaign announcement outdoors, in their native Minnesota, in February. While he\u2019s endorsed her, the 91-year-old didn\u2019t show up on Boom Island, but a blizzard did, blanketing Klobuchar\u2019s uncovered head in a veil of snow as she declared her candidacy.\n\nBut what might have seemed like an advance planner's disaster turned out to be a political gold. Klobuchar came across as full of grit and good humor, despite the fierce weather \u2014 not bad qualities for a candidate to exhibit. Little known outside the North Star State, and dinged by stories that portray her as a tough boss, the photo of her battling the elements with a smile was a friendly first introduction to many voters.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing when authenticity is a calling card in politics today.\n\n\u201cBy the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!\u201d President Trump, apparently unpersuaded, mocked in a tweet. She tweeted back: \u201cAnd I wonder how your hair would fare in a blizzard?\u201d\n\n4. What is that guy\u2019s name again?\n\nTrump, that is.\n\nKlobuchar didn\u2019t mention the president's name when she formally announced her candidacy, though she may have had him in mind when she said Americans were \u201ctired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, the gridlock and the grandstanding.\u201d Warren didn\u2019t mention his name, either, in the 4\u00bd minute video she posted announcing formation of her exploratory committee.\n\nTrump and just about everybody else expects him to be the Republican nominee, and the fevered opposition to him has fueled everything about the 2020 race.\n\nBut the lesson many take from the 2018 midterm elections and the 1998 midterms, waged during the impeachment of President Clinton, is that voters care more about what's going on in their own lives than the scandal engulfing a president. Most of the candidates have tried to emphasize what they're for, not just whom they're against.\n\nWhile Sanders did target Trump by name, he also said that wasn't the only point. \"Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history,\" he said. \"Our campaign is about transforming our country.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/02/19/bernie-sanders-2020-bid-not-surprise-but-democratic-field-diverse/2913030002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/02/19/bernie-sanders-enters-2020-race/2912998002/", "text": "CLOSE Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders announces his entry into crowded 2020 Democratic field for President.

Bernie Sanders presidential run for 2016 fell short of a Democratic Party nomination after DNC threw support behind Clinton. Ryan Mercer, Free Press Staff Writer\n\nSanders' 2016 surprise success\n\nSanders ran for the Democratic nomination in 2016, posing a vibrant \u2013 but ultimately unsuccessful \u2013 challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nSanders' grassroots, anti-establishment campaign, which leaned heavily on small donors, sparked passion among his supporters \u2013 many of them young people engaging in electoral politics for the first time.\n\nHis strong showing surprised many in the political world and established Sanders as a national figure, giving him a prominent platform for his views as his decidedly left-leaning stand on issues gained influence within the party.\n\nIn his previous campaign, Sanders labeled himself a Democratic socialist, a platform seen as too radical by the Democratic Party establishment.\n\nThis time around, those same ideas \u2013 such as Medicare for all, a higher minimum wage, free college tuition \u2013 have been embraced by mainstream candidates seeking the Democratic nomination.\n\nSanders faces challenges in 2020\n\nSanders' 2016 success in many ways puts the senator in a more challenging position for his 2020 run.\n\nRunning as a little-known candidate with an unusual message from a tiny state, Sanders gained media attention almost as a novelty and initially escaped the kind of deep scrutiny top-line contenders typically face.\n\nThis time around, Sanders has one of the highest name recognitions among Democratic contenders, trailing only former Vice President Joe Biden, who is likely to announce whether he'll jump into the 2020 race in the coming days.\n\nThat high profile makes Sanders one of the candidates to beat, meaning he will probably be targeted by other Democratic hopefuls.\n\nSanders will continue to face questions about the allegations of sexual harassment and the treatment of female staff members and volunteers stemming from his 2016 campaign.\n\nThen there's the question of age.\n\nAt 77, Sanders is the oldest among candidates who have announced, as well as those who are likely to enter the race.\n\nSanders will need to convince Democratic voters that an older white man is the right candidate in 2020 when the party is riding a wave fueled by a focus on diversity and the #MeToo movement.\n\nSanders sounds familiar notes\n\nIn his email Tuesday, Sanders offered a long list of issues that are likely to become familiar notes of his campaign speeches in the coming months.\n\nSanders targeted what for him are the usual suspects \u2013 \"Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial complex, the private-prison industry and the large multi-national corporations.\"\n\nHe hammered home the message of his fight against inequality and discrimination.\n\nSanders put out a call to his supporters.\n\n\"I am asking you today to join me as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least a million people from across the country,\" he wrote. \"They may have the money and power. We have the people. That is why we need one million Americans who will commit themselves to this campaign.\"\n\nA campaign spokesperson said Sanders has no public campaign events planned for Tuesday.\n\nText of Sanders' announcement\n\nHere is the complete text of the announcement email.\n\nBrothers and Sisters-- I am writing to let you know I have decided to run for president of the United States. I am asking you today to join me as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least a million people from across the country. Please join our campaign for president on day one and commit to doing what it takes to win this election. Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history. It is not only about winning the Democratic nomination and the general election. Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Our campaign is about taking on the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life. I'm talking about Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial complex, the private-prison industry and the large multi-national corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives. Our campaign is about redoubling our efforts to end racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry and all forms of discrimination. Our campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country while we end voter suppression, Citizens United and outrageous levels of gerrymandering. Our campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many, not just the few. We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. We should not have grotesque levels of wealth inequality in which three billionaires own more wealth than the bottom half of the country. We should not have 30 million Americans without any health insurance, even more who are under-insured and a nation in which life expectancy is actually in decline. We should not have an economy in which tens of millions of workers earn starvation wages and half of older workers have no savings as they face retirement. We should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth and a dysfunctional childcare system which is unfair to both working parents and their children. We should not have a regressive tax system in which large, profitable corporations like Amazon pay nothing in federal income taxes. Make no mistake about it. The powerful special interests in this country have unbelievable power and they want to maintain the status quo. They have unlimited amounts of money to spend on campaigns and lobbying and have huge influence over the media and political parties. The only way we will win this election and create a government and economy that works for all is with a grassroots movement \u2013 the likes of which has never been seen in American history. They may have the money and power. We have the people. That is why we need one million Americans who will commit themselves to this campaign. Stand with me as we fight to win the Democratic nomination and the general election. Add your name to join this campaign and say you are willing to do the hard work necessary to transform our country. You know as well as I do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history. We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction. I\u2019m running for president because, now more than ever, we need leadership that brings us together \u2013 not divides us up. Women and men, black, white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, young and old, native born and immigrant. Now is the time for us to stand together. I\u2019m running for president because we need leadership that will fight for working families and the shrinking middle class, not just the 1 percent. We need a president who understands that we can create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and construct the affordable housing we desperately need. I'm running for president because we need trade policies that reflect the interests of workers and not multi-national corporations. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, provide pay equity for women and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave. I'm running for president because we need to understand that artificial intelligence and robotics must benefit the needs of workers, not just corporate America and those who own that technology. I'm running for president because a great nation is judged not by how many billionaires and nuclear weapons it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable \u2013 the elderly, the children, our veterans, the sick and the poor. I\u2019m running for president because we need to make policy decisions based on science, not politics. We need a president who understands that climate change is real, is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet, and that we can generate massive job creation by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. I\u2019m running for president because the time is long overdue for the United States to join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare-for-all program. I\u2019m running for president because we need to take on the outrageous level of greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices in this country. I'm running for president because we need to have the best educated workforce in the world. It is totally counter-productive for our future that millions of Americans are carrying outrageous levels of student debt, while many others cannot afford the high cost of higher education. That is why we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower student debt. I\u2019m running for president because we must defend a woman\u2019s right to control her own body against massive political attacks taking place at the local state and federal level. I'm running for president because we need real criminal justice reform. We need to invest in jobs and education for our kids, not more jails and incarceration. We need to end the destructive \"war on drugs,\" eliminate private prisons and cash bail and bring about major police department reform. I'm running for president because we need to end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country and move to comprehensive immigration reform. We need to provide immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the DACA program and develop a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum. I'm running for president because we must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We need to take on the NRA, expand background checks, end the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I'm running for president because we need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, diplomacy and world peace. The United States must lead the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change, militarism, authoritarianism and global wealth inequality. That is why we need at least a million people to join our campaign and help lead the movement that can accomplish these goals. Add your name to say we\u2019re in this together. Needless to say, there is a lot of frightening and bad news in this world. Now, let me give you some very good news. Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were \"radical,\" and \"extreme.\" We were told that Medicare for All, a $15 an hour minimum wage, free tuition at public colleges and universities, aggressively combating climate change, demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes, were all of concepts that the American people would never accept. Well, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans. Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for. So here is my question for you: Will you stand with me as part of a million person grassroots movement which can not only win the Democratic primary, not only win the general election but most importantly help transform this country so that, finally, we have a government that works for all of us and not just the few? Add your name to say you will. Together we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and for economic, racial, social and environmental justice. And together we can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country. Brothers and sisters, if we stand together, there is no limit to what we can accomplish. I hope you will join me. Thank you very much. In solidarity, Bernie Sanders\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/02/19/bernie-sanders-enters-2020-race/2912998002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/02/16/takeaways-elizabeth-warrens-campaign-stop-greenville-attacks-trump-emergency-order/2891083002/", "text": "CLOSE U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren spoke during a campaign event at the West End Community Development Center in Greenville. Josh Morgan and Jason Clary, The Greenville News\n\nGREENVILLE, S.C. \u2013 One week after she formally announced that she is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., campaigned in South Carolina on Saturday, bashing President Donald Trump's newly declared national emergency and attacking \"corruption\" Washington.\n\nWarren is one of many Democrats bidding for the White House in the 2020 presidential election and out on the campaign trail Saturday.\n\nAt her rally last week in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the senator touted her support for progressive politics with a backdrop of Everett Mills, the site of a workers strike 100 years ago led by women and immigrants that boosted workers rights.\n\nHere are four takeaways from the Greenville, South Carolina, event Saturday:\n\n'This is the fight of our lives': Elizabeth Warren officially announces 2020 bid\n\nStanding-room crowd turned out\n\nMost of the seats set up inside the West End Community Development Center were filled shortly after the doors opened at 10 a.m., an hour before Warren spoke. Her campaign said about 800 people came to the event.\n\nThe crowd included Kelly Reaves and her 16-year-old son, Jordan, who traveled to Greenville from Hendersonville, North Carolina. Kelly Reaves said she supports Warren's positions on health care, climate change and women's rights.\n\nU.S. Sen.

(Photo: JOSH MORGAN/Staff)\n\nWarren's two problems with Trump's emergency declaration for a border wall\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Greenville News, part of the USA TODAY Network, the Massachusetts senator said she has \"two problems\" with Trump's decision to declare a national emergency to justify the allocation of federal dollars to build a wall on the Mexican border.\n\n\"The first is I don\u2019t think this is an emergency. The facts don\u2019t support it. And the second is I don\u2019t think it is legal. That\u2019s why there\u2019s already a challenge in court. Ultimately of course the courts will determine that,\" Warren said. \u201cI think he\u2019s headed in the wrong direction here.\u201d\n\nAddressing another issue, Warren said that \"a trade war by tweet as the president has done, it makes no sense. It doesn\u2019t make us build a stronger economy or help workers here in the United States.\"\n\nLaila Jaber applauds as she and more than two hundred others listen to U.S. Sen.

It works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere \u2013 just not for people who see climate change headed our way,\" she said.\n\n\"It works great for investors in private prisons \u2013 just not for the people whose lives and the communities that are torn apart. Yeah, Washington works great for those who have money. And we need to call that out what it is: corruption, pure and simple.\"\n\nSharing the stage in South Carolina, a key state in the 2020 race\n\nWarren, who was scheduled to travel to an event in Georgia later Saturday, was not the only Democratic presidential hopeful stumping in South Carolina. Sen. Kamala Harris of California held a town hall in Charleston on Friday and traveled to Columbia for another campaign event on Saturday.\n\nSouth Carolina will be the site of the first Southern primary in the Democratic race for president next February, making it a key player in the race, analysts say.\n\nFollow Kirk Brown on Twitter @KirkBrown_AIM\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/02/16/takeaways-elizabeth-warrens-campaign-stop-greenville-attacks-trump-emergency-order/2891083002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/02/16/border-emergency-donald-trump-quote-undercuts-move-critics-says/2881619002/", "text": "CLOSE President Trump declared a national emergency to free up funding for his border wall between the U.S and Mexico. But declaring a national emergency isn\u2019t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Thirty minutes into an off-the-cuff defense of his decision to declare a national emergency to help build his border wall, President Donald Trump made an admission that may have handed ammunition to legal opponents of the move.\n\nTrump, who has long described the situation on the Southwest border as a \"crisis\" and an \"invasion,\" appeared to suggest his administration had all the time it needed to build the hundreds of miles of border barrier he has demanded for months.\n\n\"I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't need to do this,\" Trump told reporters gathered in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, shortly before he signed a proclamation declaring the emergency. \"But I'd rather do it much faster.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s opponents, including a number of groups and officials suing the administration over the national emergency, pounced on the president's candid remarks and said they appeared to undermine his claims of an urgent problem on the southern border.\n\nMore: Follow the money: How Trump's national emergency will pay for a border wall\n\nMore: Here's how Democrats will try to stop Trump's national emergency order\n\nGeorge Conway, an attorney and frequent Trump critic who is married to longtime Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, summed up the reaction in a post on Twitter: \"This quote should be the first sentence of the first paragraph of every [lawsuit] filed.\"\n\nThis quote should be the first sentence of the first paragraph of every complaint filed this afternoon. https://t.co/ClHQhpTaEe \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 15, 2019\n\nA bevy of groups lining up to challenge Trump's national emergency are likely to rely on the quote to suggest the \"emergency\" is a fiction. Federal courts closely studied Trump's own words and tweets to pick apart the administration's argument that the travel ban the president signed in early 2017 wasn't targeted at mostly Muslim countries.But in a decision upholding the ban, the Supreme Court said it had to consider not only Trump's statements but also \"the authority of the presidency itself\" in reviewing his actions.\n\nBut experts said the president's words, which were emblazoned on cable network chyrons most of Friday, are unlikely to bring down Trump's emergency declaration. The National Emergencies Act gives a president wide authority to define what an emergency is \u2013 setting no hard rules over how urgent a problem must be or how potentially damaging.\n\nCongress wrote the law, intentionally, to give presidents flexibility. The more challenging legal question for the White House is what powers Trump intends to invoke once the national emergency is declared.\n\n\"Because the president's words are so at odds with the ordinary meaning of 'emergency,' any brief challenging the emergency would be negligent not to quote him,\" said Peter M. Shane, a constitutional and administrative law professor at Ohio State University. \"Whether a court would use those words to void the declaration is another matter.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared a national emergency Feb. 15, 2019, at the White House in an attempt to fund and build his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. (Photo: ERIK S. LESSER, EPA-EFE)\n\nTrump signed the proclamation Friday after Congress sent him legislation that funds the government through the end of September, averting another shutdown, and included $1.375 billion for the wall, much less than the $5.7 billion he had initially demanded. The White House said Trump will attempt to access another $6.6 billion through the national emergency and by shifting funds from other programs.\n\nPublic Citizen, a Washington-based watchdog group, was among the first to say they intended to sue over Trump's emergency. Allison M. Zieve, the director of the watchdog's litigation group, said the organization will \"definitely recite his statement in our papers, and I expect that all the complaints will.\"\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, also raised Trump's remarks during his own press conference on Friday in which he said he\u2019s coordinating with other attorneys general to prepare a lawsuit.\n\n\"President Trump got one thing right this morning about his declaration when he said, 'I didn\u2019t have to do this.' He\u2019s right, he didn\u2019t have to do this,\" Becerra said. \"In fact, he can\u2019t do this because the U.S. Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to direct dollars.\u201d\n\nU.S. government data from the southern border indicates the vast majority of narcotics captured at the border is coming in through ports of entry, not the wide swaths of border in between where additional barriers could be erected. And the number of migrants apprehended for trying to enter the U.S. illegally is significantly less than it was a decade ago.\n\nApprehensions along the southern border are actually at historic lows. Border Patrol routinely apprehended more than 1 million people a year \u2013 peaking at 1.6 million in 2000 \u2013 throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In 2017, it apprehended just over 300,000. It 2018, it apprehended just under 400,000.\n\nBut experts predicted few of those points will matter legally.\n\nMore: Trump's emergency declaration would trigger a drawn-out legal fight\n\n\"The litigation isn\u2019t going to turn on whether an emergency was 'necessary,'\" said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas-Austin law professor who teaches national security law.\n\n\"It will certainly be invoked by challengers,\" he said, \"but it\u2019s not a game-ending blunder.\"\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this\u201d is admitting this isn\u2019t an emergency at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this\u201d means he\u2019s faking a crisis. https://t.co/TVqp0z4EHI \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 15, 2019\n\nMore: Follow the money: How President Trump's national emergency will pay for a border wall\n\nMore: 'Every remedy available': Here's what Democrats vow to do to rebuff Trump's national emergency order on the border wall\n\nMore: National emergencies are common; declaring one for a border wall is not\n\nMore: 'Dangerous precedent': U.S. Chamber joins conservative critics of Trump's emergency declaration\n\nMore: Government shutdown stymied frozen tax refunds, tied up IRS phone lines, report shows\n\nMore: Can the middle-class revival under Trump last?\n\nContributing: Richard Wolf, Alan Gomez\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/02/16/border-emergency-donald-trump-quote-undercuts-move-critics-says/2881619002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/01/29/howard-schultz-heckled/2708340002/", "text": "CLOSE There's more to Howard Schultz than just Starbucks coffee.

But he added that he would only run as an independent if he believed he could win, so he couldn't \"answer that question today.\"\n\n\"But I'm certainly not going to do anything to put Donald Trump back in the Oval Office,\" he said.\n\nIf he runs, Schultz says it will be as an independent centrist because both Republicans and Democrats have been taken over by their extreme wings. When asked about Rep.

No meetings are currently scheduled between Trump and Pelosi to try to resolve the budget impasse at the heart of the shutdown.\n\nWhile some Republicans have said they would consider a Democratic plan to reopen the government now while wall negotiations continue, Trump claimed the party is united behind his hard-line approach to keeping it closed.\n\n\"Never seen the Republican Party so unified,\" Trump tweeted. \"No 'Cave' on the issue of Border and National Security.\"\n\nContribution: Michael Collins, David Jackson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/18/trump-campaign-sending-bricks-pelosi-schumer/2617158002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/01/07/election-2020-candidates-who-running-white-house/2470716002/", "text": "CLOSE Sen.

We can make our economy work for all of us. We can rebuild America's middle class, but this time we've got to build it for everyone.\"\n\nShe has been a fierce critic of Trump and his administration and he has made her one of his favorite targets, referring to her as \"Goofy Elizabeth Warren\" in tweets and mocking her claims of Cherokee heritage by calling her \"Pocahontas.\" Conservatives have accused Warren of making that claim to gain favor in applying for jobs, but the universities where she worked at have said her ethnicity played no role in her hiring.\n\nPartly in response to Trump's jibes, Warren released the results of DNA test which found \"strong evidence\" of Native American ancestry. But the release was widely mocked because the results only showed that her Native American ancestry went back 6 to 10 generations.\n\nAnd the test showing that she was at least 1/1024th Native American was denounced by the Cherokee nation, which said using \"a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong.\"\n\nTrump has said he believes he could easily defeat Warren in a general election.\n\n\"I do not think she'd be difficult at all,\" Trump told reporters on Oct. 15. \"She will destroy the country.

Last week, a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that 27 percent of Democratic and independent voters were excited by the prospect of a Warren candidacy, while 33 percent opposed her running.\n\nThe most popular choice in that poll was someone new altogether, while Biden had the most support among the known potential candidates. The former vice president has led in most early polling but, historically, the early front-runner has rarely gone on to win a party's primary.\n\n\"Sen.

Three of the projects have been completed; two are underway. Three others will begin during 2019's first half, including areas of south Texas that previously had no barriers.\n\nMore new fencing could soon follow.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection has received more than $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 for border infrastructure. That money is paying for the eight scheduled projects, and a few more that have not been announced yet. Homeland Security officials said more contracts will be awarded in coming weeks.\n\nIn late December, officials unveiled how additional money they've requested from Congress for border security would be spent.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2018\n\nHere are the locations of the two projects expected to be finished in 2019 and the three construction projects slated to begin in 2019:\n\nRio Grande Valley\n\nIn February, crews will begin building 14 miles of levee walls just south of McAllen, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley \u2014 the busiest point for illegal entries along the southwest border.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection awarded two contracts worth a total of $312 million to SLSCO Ltd. of Galveston, Texas, to build the barriers.\n\nThe new barriers will be built on top of existing levees north of the Rio Grande, which tends to flood with seasonal rains. The barriers consist of the solid concrete levees built to their existing height, with 18-foot-tall bollard-style fencing at the top. The barriers will be built in six segments along the Rio Grande, Customs and Border Protection said.\n\nEast of these levee walls, a San Antonio-based company is installing at least seven gates along sections of the border fence north of the river that were built during the past decade.\n\nThat work is the first phase of a project to install 35 border gates.\n\nThe gates, besides stemming the flow of people and narcotics, are intended to give landowners access to their lands south of the barriers, as well as the Rio Grande to irrigate their fields.\n\nYuma and Lukeville\n\nIn April, construction will resume along the Arizona-Mexico border as crews begin replacing 32 miles of existing primary fencing in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nTwenty-seven of those miles are in Yuma; 5 miles are in Lukeville.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection awarded a contract worth $172 million to Barnard Construction Co. of Bozeman, Montana. It will work to replace 14 miles of aging, Vietnam-era landing mat fencing east of the San Luis port of entry.\n\nCrews will remove the 18-foot-tall landing mats and install bollard-style fencing that's 30 feet tall.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection said it also plans to replace an additional 11.5 miles of landing-mat fencing east of that area, along with a 1.5 mile stretch of mesh-style fencing near the Colorado River. But the agency has not said when construction will begin.\n\nBoth Lukeville and Yuma have seen large groups of migrant families, some numbering as many as 150, crossing the border illegally in the past year and voluntarily turning themselves over to agents.\n\nEl Centro and San Diego\n\nCLOSE As reporter Dennis Wagner makes his way along the U.S, Mexico border, a fence only a few miles long appears south of El Paso. A USA TODAY NETWORK video production.\n\nIn July, construction crews will begin to replace 15 miles of primary fencing along the California-Mexico border. Eleven of those miles are in Calexico, 3 are in Tecate, and 1 mile is near Andrade, across the California-Arizona line from Yuma.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection awarded a contract worth $156 million to SLSCO of Galveston for the project. In its announcement, the agency said it had also awarded the company an additional $131 million contract to replace 14 miles of secondary fencing in San Diego.\n\nAll four segments will employ the 30-foot bollard-style fencing.\n\nMORE: $324M contract awarded to replace border fencing near Yuma and Lukeville\n\nThe San Diego-Tijuana border area has received attention in recent months as thousands of migrants traveling in caravans arrived there, hoping to seek asylum.\n\nBut with waits of up to six weeks to present their claims at the port of entry, many asylum seekers, and migrants with no plans to seek asylum, have been breaching the border illegally.\n\n\"Given the high-density population in San Diego-Tijuana urban area, the stronger infrastructure is critically important,\" Customs and Border Protection said in its announcement.\n\nCompleted projects\n\nThe three replacement projects that have been completed are in Calexico, El Paso, and Santa Teresa, New Mexico.\n\nWork crews finished 2.25 miles of 30-foot-tall bollards in Calexico in October, the first project completed under the Trump administration.

Unlike Calexico, CBP officials there did not mark the project's conclusion.\n\nIn November, crews finished 20 miles of vehicle fencing with 18- to 30-foot bollards in Santa Teresa, west of metropolitan El Paso.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection spent about $113 million to complete the three projects.\n\nREAD MORE ON IMMIGRATION AT THE BORDER:\n\nWant more news like this?

Rick Scott spent nearly $63.6 million of his own money to win a U.S. Senate seat in November \u2013 a staggering self-funding record for a congressional campaign.\n\nBy unseating three-term Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, Scott also bucked a trend. The vast majority of congressional candidates who dig deep into their own piggy banks to finance their campaigns lose.\n\nFrom the 1998 election cycle through 2018, 283 candidates for the House and Senate gave or loaned themselves at least $1 million, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance data.\n\nMost reached into their own wallets and pocketbooks for the bulk of their money, providing about seven of every 10 dollars they raised for their campaigns, according to the center.\n\nOf those, only 50 won (32 House and 18 Senate), or fewer than one in five.\n\nThat trend held in 2018.\n\nOf the 15 Senate self-funding candidates in this cycle, only Scott and two others emerged victorious: Republican Mike Braun of Indiana who loaned himself $10.6 million and beat Democratic Incumbent Joe Donnelly; and incumbent Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who won a fifth full term with the help of $3 million she donated to her campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nAnd of the 24 House contestants, only six won. That includes Democrat David Trone, who loaned or gave himself almost all of the $16.5 million he raised to capture Maryland's open 6th District seat. Two years ago, Trone lost the same race despite shelling out $13.4 million of his own money.\n\nSo why do self-funders have such a poor record of success?\n\nMany of them come from the business world making their first runs for office. In their roles as executives calling the shots, they often don't have to engage in the glad-handing and face-to-face relationships required of political campaigns, said Meredith McGehee, a campaign finance expert and executive director of Issue One, a government reform advocacy group.\n\n\u201cThe skill set they brought to their campaigns doesn\u2019t translate very well into being a good politician and I think that\u2019s why they often lose,\" she said. \"A good politician is a good retail sales person and retail sales is its own world.

That order has been questioned because it followed Trump's comments suggesting that troops could fire upon migrants if they throw rocks at the troops.\n\n\"I told them to consider it a rifle,\" Trump said during a White House speech on Nov. 1. \"When they throw rocks like what they did to the Mexican military and police I say consider it a rifle.\"\n\nThe situation got even more heated on Nov. 25 when about 1,000 migrants clashed with CBP officers at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in California, leading CBP officers to fire tear gas into a crowd of men, women and children.\n\nMigrant advocates called it a dangerous overreaction against a group of unarmed migrants who were mostly protesting the slow process of requesting asylum at the port, while CBP officials said the measures were necessary to stop migrants who were trying to illegally cross the border while throwing rocks at CBP agents.\n\nCLOSE Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen are inspecting troops at the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, even though the caravan of migrants that prompted the deployment is headed to California . (Nov. 14) AP\n\nAdvocates for the migrants say the continued militarization of the southern border is nothing more than a political stunt that ignores the true intentions of the Central American migrants: to legally present themselves at ports of entry.\n\nTrump, Nielsen and Mattis have dismissed those accusations, accusing caravan members of being criminals and calling their arrival at the U.S. border a matter of national security.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/12/04/military-troops-remain-border-through-january-says-pentagon/2207713002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2018/11/29/teachers-election-2018-oklahoma-teachers-tony-evers-jahana-hayes-betsy-devos/2128848002/", "text": "Democrat Jahana Hayes, candidate in Connecticut's 5th Congressional District, speaks during an election night rally, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Waterbury, Conn.

And it\u2019s exactly why she ran for Congress.\n\nHayes, who won her race for Connecticut's 5th District with nearly 56 percent of the vote, was part of the blue wave in the election Nov. 6 that put Democrats in power in the House of Representatives.\n\nHayes wants to keep another important label: educator.\n\nTeachers were on the ballot all over the country this cycle, spurred by demonstrations this year that protested low teacher pay and cuts in money for education. After years of being told what to do by lawmakers, teachers said they want to start making the laws themselves.\n\nCLOSE Teachers are taking matters into their own hands and running for office this election year. USA TODAY\n\nThe 2016 national teacher of the year, Hayes was one of the most well-known educators to win her race. The other was Tony Evers, a longtime educator and Democrat who stunned incumbent Republican Scott Walker in the Wisconsin governor\u2019s race.\n\nAcross the country, educators were voted into state legislative offices. The National Education Association said almost 1,110 educators will flood legislative ranks when sessions begin in January. (The organization includes teachers, administrators, support staff and college personnel in its definition of \"educator.\") That's out of nearly 7,400 state lawmakers.\n\nIn Oklahoma, where a teacher walkout this spring lasted a week and a half, the number of educators in the Legislature nearly tripled, from nine to 25.\n\nMore: I\u2019m an Oklahoma educator who ran for office \u2013 and won. Here\u2019s how I did it.\n\nMore: Even when teachers strike, Americans give them high grades, poll shows. Unions fare worse.\n\nTeachers find their voices\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a real shot in the arm for us (teachers) but also for America,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cTeachers are problem solvers, and when you have problem solvers sitting in state legislatures and in Congress and in governor\u2019s seats, they understand education and the challenges of it.\n\n\"They\u2019re not going to be like (Secretary of Education) Betsy DeVos, who just takes cheap shots at education instead of rolling up her sleeves.\"\n\nDeVos, a school choice advocate whose appointment served as the tipping point for many public school teachers who decided to run, has been heavily scrutinized by Democrats and teachers unions across the country.\n\nTeachers had other common opponents. In Wisconsin, Walker pushed a law that gutted the state\u2019s teachers unions.\n\nGovernor-elect Tony Evers, right, walks into a room filled with press before making a statement, and answering questions on Wednesday Nov. 7, 2018.

No matter where they work, they feel disrespect\n\nMake a difference, or her husband will 'primary me out'\n\nToni Hasenbeck, a Republican who won her race for Oklahoma's House of Representatives, said the impact of the 2018 election will be felt for decades. Teachers, parents and community members who got engaged the past few months understand how local government works and how bills are made, which will allow them to track progress and \u201chold our (politicians\u2019) feet to the fire.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s already been warned by one voter that he\u2019ll be watching closely to make sure she stays true to her campaign promises.\n\n\u201cMy husband told me if I don\u2019t make good choices, he\u2019ll primary me out,\u201d she said.\n\nOklahoma teachers went on strike this year. (Photo: David Wallace, The Republic-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nHasenbeck, who ran for office in 2016 and lost her primary by just 93 votes, had to resign from her seventh-grade English position to serve in the Oklahoma Legislature, per state law. Though she knew it was coming, saying goodbye to all her students was harder than she anticipated.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of crying from me,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich was really unexpected.\u201d\n\nYet on her first day in the Capitol, \u201cI got that feeling that you\u2019re exactly where you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d\n\nState law prohibits Hasenbeck from substituting, so she gets her classroom fix by visiting schools and teachers, shaking hands and making sure they understand she won\u2019t forget them.\n\n\u201cI want to remind teachers that I know what it feels like to have 56 kindergarten eyeballs staring up at you when you\u2019ve finished the activity you thought would take all day in just 30 minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to go home and grade 170 essays. I know what it\u2019s like to be in their struggle.\u201d\n\nOklahoma's teachers-turned-lawmakers want to pass education changes in the first 100 days, said Melissa Provenzano, an administrator and former teacher who won as a Democrat in a traditionally Republican Statehouse district. \"We would be foolish to not address it right out of the gate,\" she said. \"The new government and the old guard received a message in this election \u2013 and that message was, \"You better get busy on education.' \"\n\nMaking laws and helping students\n\nIn Washington, speculation has ramped up that Democrats will use their power in the House to take on DeVos over a variety of issues. Hayes said that talk assigns too much power to one person.\n\n\u201cWe have a secretary of education who fundamentally disagrees on many of the things that I think about education,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is about our kids. I\u2019m not here to work against Betsy DeVos. I\u2019m here fighting to solidify programs that will help students and communities.\u201d\n\nShe appreciates \u201chow significant it is that I\u2019m in the room,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cI can say to Secretary DeVos, \u2018I know what you think you\u2019re doing, but let me explain what it looks like to a teacher by the time (that policy) gets to a classroom.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDepartment of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies at a budget hearing by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee. (Photo: Win McNamee, USA TODAY)\n\nIn her heart, Hayes said, she\u2019s always an educator.\n\nShe has been busy building her staff and trying to maintain her campaign\u2019s message that government belongs to everyone. She\u2019s thrilled about legislation passed this year to allow paid internships on Capitol Hill, which will open doors to hundreds of students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n\u201cMany of the young people I came in contact with during my campaign wanted to work on the Hill, but they weren\u2019t in a financial position with their families to be supported for six to eight weeks in D.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I want to seek those kids out.\u201d\n\nJahana Hayes, a Democratic House candidate in Connecticut, laughed with supporters after speaking on a panel at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual legislative conference Sept. 14, 2018.

She recognizes the crucial role youth will play if Democrats are to win more races in 2020. She wants them to know their voices matter and their vote counted.\n\n\u201cI keep thinking of what Alexander Hamilton says in the musical,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want to throw away my shot.\u201d\n\nEducation coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

(AP) \u2014 Democrat Anthony Brindisi defeated Republican U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney, following a contentious race for New York's 22nd Congressional District that was settled by absentee ballots more than three weeks after Election Day.\n\nBrindisi, an attorney and state assemblyman from Utica, was ahead by less than 2,000 votes on election night. On Wednesday, his lead had grown to just under 4,000 as additional absentee ballots were counted. While the results from 1,881 remaining ballots have yet to be reported, Brindisi's lead makes it mathematically impossible for Tenney to prevail.\n\nBrindisi, 40, campaigned on calls for civility and bipartisanship in a district that supported Donald Trump in 2016. He was in Washington on Wednesday to prepare for his new job.\n\n\"I'm going to work on issues just as hard for people who did not support me as for those who did support me,\" Brindisi said Monday during an interview with WKTV-TV. \"I believe that once elections are over, that's when the governing begins. When people call my office we're not going to ask them... are you a Democrat or a Republican. That does not matter to me.\"\n\nHe cited health care, funding for new roads, bridges and water systems, campaign finance reform and help for farmers as some of his top priorities.\n\nTenney was an early and vocal supporter of Donald Trump and whose brash rhetoric had similarities to the president's.\n\nDemocrats complained when Tenney's staff sent out a memo attempting to link her Italian-American opponent to the mafia because of his father's legal work for organized crime figures years ago.\n\nShe called her own alma mater, Colgate University, which is in the district, a \"left-wing crazy school\" and circulated a petition calling for the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton. While defending gun ownership rights, Tenney said during in an interview that many people behind mass murders are Democrats.\n\nTenney, 57, argued that her comments were blown out of proportion by an adversarial media. But her rhetoric turned off some of the area's leading Republicans, including her predecessor, former Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hanna, who called Tenney a \"pariah\" who is \"full of anger and hate.\"\n\nRepublicans outnumber Democrats in the district, which includes dairy farms and struggling former manufacturing towns such as Binghamton and Utica. Voters there favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016 by 16 percentage points.\n\nTrump's margins in 2016 meant that to win the district, Brindisi had to appeal to independents and Republican moderates.\n\nRepublicans fought hard to defend Tenney. Trump, his son Eric and House Speaker Paul Ryan all visited the district to raise money or campaign.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/28/anthony-brindisi-beats-claudia-tenny-ny-congressional-race/2144347002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/28/cindy-hyde-smith-campaign-criticized-viral-tweet-media-yearbook-public-hanging/2144570002/", "text": "CLOSE Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith says she will work hard to represent everyone in Mississippi.

Cindy Hyde-Smith the winner in the U.S. Senate runoff election Tuesday night, the Republican senator's campaign team posted a controversial tweet that targeted Mississippi media.\n\nTeam Cindy, the official twitter account of the Hyde-Smith communications team, tweeted out a popular GIF meme of a man pouring gas into a fire pit and subsequently catching the yard on fire.

Some of those publications, including the Clarion Ledger, also did not post a story about the yearbook photo.\n\n\"I think it was not meant to be any long-lasting comment on media or anything like that, just for this particular campaign,\" Scallan said. \"Since the campaign\u2019s over, we\u2019re going to call you out on it.\"\n\nThe video has gotten over 60,000 views and hundreds of people responded.

(Photo: Sarah Warnock, Clarion Ledger)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith led Democratic challenger Mike Espy with about 40 percent of the vote counted Tuesday night.\n\nThe race has drawn national attention from both parties as Hyde-Smith has sought to tamp down a controversy over her remarks about a \"public hanging\" that evoked memories of the state's brutal past of slavery and racism.\n\nEspy is seeking to become Mississippi's first black U.S. senator since Reconstruction. President Donald Trump held two rallies in the state on Monday for Hyde-Smith, urging voters to turn out.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Tuesday's runoff:\n\nWhy a runoff?\n\nThe race is the conclusion of a special election for the seat of Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who retired in April. Hyde-Smith was appointed to fill the seat for the remainder of Cochran's term, becoming the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress.\n\nThe candidates were forced into a runoff after neither won a majority in the Nov. 6 election. The race split three ways, with Hyde-Smith earning 41.3 percent of the vote to Espy's 40.9 and former state senator Chris McDaniel snatching 16.4 percent.\n\nPolls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. CST.\n\nMississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said that as of Monday, 46,428 absentee ballots had been requested for the runoff, portending high and perhaps record turnout, at least by runoff standards. The Nov. 6 election set a record for a Mississippi midterm, with more than 940,000 votes cast of the 1.8 million registered voters.\n\nThe candidates and the controversies\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Tuesday's runoff, Hyde-Smith was plagued by controversy. She continues to face backlash from comments made Nov. 2 that she'd be in the \"front row\" if invited to a \"public hanging.\" The former beef cattle farmer and state agriculture commissioner was also caught on video making comments about voter suppression.\n\nHyde-Smith's critics say her comments have stirred up images of lynching and Mississippi's racist past, which was underscored Monday when nooses were found hanging from trees near the state's capitol in Jackson.\n\nIn his uphill battle to defeat Hyde-Smith, Espy has walked a fine line on the issue of race as he attempts to win over voters. A former congressman and U.S. secretary of agriculture in the Clinton administration, Espy has focused on casting himself as a moderate who can work with both parties on issues like access to health care.\n\nDemocratic candidate Mike Espy votes in a U.S. Senate runoff election Nov. 27, 2018, in Ridgeland, Mississippi. (Photo: Rogelio V. Solis, AP)\n\nAfrican-American turnout is key\n\nAlthough Hyde-Smith's lead in the polls has shrunk in recent weeks, she's still favored to win. To pull off an upset, Espy needs to motivate African-Americans voters to turn out and also capture the votes of some white voters.\n\n\u201cThe contest is going to be decided on race one way or the other because Espy\u2019s path to victory is dependent on African-American turnout,\" Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the nonpartisan Cook Report, told USA TODAY.\n\nAbout 38 percent of Mississippians are African-American. Black voters in the state lean strongly Democratic. But the state has historically been a Republican stronghold, as many white voters favor the GOP.\n\nWhat this means for the Senate\n\nThe Mississippi runoff is the last Senate contest this election cycle. If Hyde-Smith wins Tuesday, Republicans will have 53 seats next year instead of the 51 they now hold. Even if she loses, Republicans will still hold a majority in the Senate but will have one less vote to count on.\n\nA total of 53 votes gives Republican Senate leaders room for potential defections but it would not put them over the threshold for most controversial bills, which need 60 votes. While winning a majority in the Senate, Republicans saw control of the House flip to Democrats in the midterms.\n\nMore: Mississippi Senate candidates Hyde-Smith, Espy make final pitches\n\nMore: A look at Mike Espy before US Senate runoff: People over party, keeping head down\n\nMore: A look at Cindy Hyde-Smith before US Senate runoff: Trump's choice, guarded public image\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY, and Geoffrey Pender, Clarion Ledger.\n\nVoters wait in line at a polling precinct in north Jackson, Mississippi.

(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration has quietly resumed separating immigrant families at the border, in some cases using vague or unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing or minor violations against the parents, including charges of illegally re-entering the country, as justification.\n\nOver the last three months, lawyers at Catholic Charities, which provides legal services to immigrant children in government custody in New York, have discovered at least 16 new separation cases. They say they have come across such instances by chance and via their own sleuthing after children were put into temporary foster care and shelters with little or no indication that they arrived at the border with their parents.\n\nProPublica stumbled upon one more case late last month after receiving a call from a distraught Salvadoran father who had been detained in South Texas, and whose 4-year-old son, Brayan, had literally been yanked from his grasp by a Customs and Border Protection agent after they crossed the border and asked for asylum. Julio, the father, asked to be identified only by his first name because he was fleeing gang violence and worried about the safety of relatives back home.\n\n\u201cI failed him,\u201d said Julio, 27, sobbing uncontrollably. \u201cEverything I had done to be a good father was destroyed in an instant.\u201d\n\nProPublica tracked down Brayan, who has reddish-blond hair and an endearing lisp, at a temporary foster care agency in New York City, and reached out to the lawyer who represents him. Until that phone call, the lawyer, Jodi Ziesemer, a supervising attorney at Catholic Charities, had no idea that Brayan had been separated from his father. The chaos, she said, felt disturbingly like zero tolerance all over again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so disheartening,\u201d Ziesemer said \u201cThis was supposed to be a policy that ended.\u201d\n\nOfficially it has. On June 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order retreating from his so-called zero-tolerance immigration enforcement policy, which called on authorities to criminally prosecute adults caught illegally crossing the border and separate them from any children they brought with them. A week later, a federal judge, Dana M. Sabraw, issued an injunction against the separations and ordered the government to put the thousands of affected families back together.\n\nCLOSE President Donald Trump says he \"didn\u2019t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.\" USA TODAY\n\nSabraw, however, exempted cases in which the safety of the child was at risk, and crucially, imposed no standards or oversight over those decisions. As a result, attorneys say, immigration officials \u2014 taking their cues from an administration that has made it clear it still believes family separations are an effective deterrent \u2014 are using whatever justification they can find, with or without substantiation, to deem immigrant parents unfit or unsafe.\n\nMore: Who is Dana Sabraw?\n\n\u201cIf the authorities have even the most specious evidence that a parent was a gang member, or had some kind of blemish on their record,\u201d said Neha Desai, a senior attorney at the National Center for Youth Law, \u201canything they can come up with to say that the separation is for the health and welfare of the child, then they\u2019ll separate them.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nothing to do with zero tolerance\u2019\n\nIn an email, a senior CBP official acknowledged that immigrant families are still being separated, but said the separations had \u201cnothing to do with zero tolerance.\u201d The official added that \u201cthis administration continues to comply with the law and separates adults and children when required for the safety and security of the child.\u201d The official declined to say how many children have been taken from their parents for what was said to be their own protection.\n\nCBP officials explained that Brayan was such a case. One official said that the agency had conducted a routine background check on Julio, and that it \u201cconfirmed his gang affiliation with MS-13.\u201d Spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer declined to provide the evidence the agency had to support the allegation, saying only that it was \u201claw enforcement sensitive.\u201d Nor would she say why CBP believed Julio was a danger to his child. But Sabraw\u2019s order, she said, \u201cdid not prevent these separations, in fact it explicitly allows DHS to continue with this prior practice.\u201d\n\nCBP has also not shared any evidence supporting its assertion of Julio\u2019s gang ties with his lawyer, Georgia Evangelista, who said she wonders whether it exists.\n\n(On Tuesday, a government lawyer repeated the allegation to an immigration judge in South Texas but said he could not provide documentation to the court because it was \u201cconfidential,\u201d according to Evangelista. She said the immigration judge did not press for release of the evidence but freed her client on an $8,000 bond. Evangelista was frustrated by the outcome, saying, \u201cHow can we fight these charges when we don\u2019t know what they are.\u201d)\n\nAccording to Evangelista, Julio arrived at the border in mid-September, carrying a letter prepared by a Salvadoran lawyer that explained that he had fled El Salvador with his son because he had been attacked and threatened by gangs there for years. At Evangelista\u2019s request, the Salvadoran lawyer and Julio\u2019s former employer sent sworn statements vouching for Julio\u2019s character, and stating that he was never involved in criminal activity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m furious about this. They aren\u2019t playing by the rules,\u201d Evangelista said, referring to U.S. immigration authorities. \u201cThey\u2019re treating him like a criminal so they can justify taking away his son. Where\u2019s the proof? It\u2019s his word against theirs. It sickens me.\u201d\n\nSusan Watson, a civil rights and family lawyer, said this kind of action could not be done without a judge\u2019s review in custody cases that do not involve immigration issues. \u201cConstitutionally, before a parent is separated from a child, you are entitled to due process,\u201d she said. \u201cSome decision in a dark corner by the Border Patrol doesn\u2019t meet that standard.\u201d\n\nIn New York, Ziesemer says the new separations identified by her organization involve children between the ages of 2 and 17, including Brayan. All of them arrived in New York City without any records indicating they had been separated from their parents at the border and why. A few weeks ago, the ACLU, which brought the lawsuit over the first round of family separations, sent a letter to the Justice Department raising concerns about the new cases, specifically about the grounds for the separations and why the ACLU hadn\u2019t been notified about them.\n\n\u2018Flimsy excuses\u2019\n\nLee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who led the organization\u2019s lawsuit against family separations in the spring, said, \u201cIf the government is still secretly separating children, and is doing so based on flimsy excuses, that would be patently unconstitutional and we will be back in court.\u201d\n\nLawyers at the ACLU and Catholic Charities said that the DOJ responded that it wasn\u2019t obligated to report the new separations to the ACLU because they hadn\u2019t been done as a part of the zero-tolerance policy. The DOJ said that in 14 of the 17 cases flagged in the ACLU\u2019s letter, the children were removed from their parents\u2019 custody because authorities suspected the parents had some kind of criminal background that made them unfit \u2014 even dangerous. But the agency would not specify what crimes the parents were suspected of committing and what evidence authorities had to support these allegations.\n\nProtesters rally against President Trump's immigrant family separation policies in Philadelphia, Penn., June 30, 2018. (Photo: DOMINICK REUTER, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe ACLU and other groups representing immigrant children said the DOJ\u2019s secrecy is highly troubling on several counts. They worry that the Department of Homeland Security has allowed authorities without formal training in custody issues \u2014 primarily Border Patrol agents \u2014 to make decisions using standards that could violate the spirit of the court order and that would never hold up in non-immigration cases. Ziesemer has talked to relatives and social workers and says she suspects that at least eight of the cases involve parents whose crime is illegally re-entering the country. Illegal re-entry is a felony, although previous administrations did not typically separate families in such cases. Ziesemer said the allegations the government has advanced to justify separations in eight other cases were either vague or unsubstantiated. The final case she identified involved a parent who was hospitalized.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s position is that because these are not zero-tolerance cases, they don\u2019t have to tell us, or anyone, about them,\u201d Ziesemer said. \u201cOur position is that when children are separated from their parents, there needs to be some oversight.\u201d\n\nMore: Timeline: Immigrant children separated from families at the border\n\nBrayan\u2019s case is a vivid example of how government officials are interpreting the court order to allow separations of families.\n\nI found out about him by accident. Early last month, after the government reported that of the more than 2,600 immigrant children separated under the zero-tolerance policy, only one child under the age of 5 remained in their care. I decided to try to find that child, thinking the case might make a compelling bookend to a story I\u2019d written this year about a girl named Alison Jimena Valencia Madrid, whose cries were recorded inside a Border Patrol detention facility in June. The recording ignited a storm of outrage that tipped the political scales against the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy.\n\nAn attorney on the border, Thelma O. Garcia, said she represented a 6-year-old Salvadoran boy named Wilder Hilario Maldonado Cabrera, who was in a temporary foster home in San Antonio. Wilder had been separated from his father in June, Garcia said, and hadn\u2019t been reunited because the father had a 10-year-old warrant for a DUI charge in Florida.\n\nThe father, Hilario Maldonado, called me from the South Texas detention facility in Pearsall and said he\u2019d tried to keep in touch with Wilder by phone, but his social worker didn\u2019t always pick up. When they did connect, he said, Wilder, pudgy, precocious and missing his two front teeth, scolded him for not coming to take him home.\n\nI told Maldonado that it appeared he would be one of the last parents to go through such a separation because the government had agreed to stop them.\n\nMaldonado, 39, said that wasn\u2019t true. The separations are still happening, he said, and he knew of one.\n\nA few minutes later, I got a call from Julio, who was at the same detention facility. He sounded desperate, crying and pleading for answers. He said he\u2019d turned himself and Brayan into the authorities as soon as they\u2019d crossed the border, asked for asylum and told immigration agents that his mother, who lives in Austin, Texas, was willing to help him get on his feet. Seven days later, a Border Patrol agent took Brayan, dressed in a SpongeBob SquarePants T-shirt, away, screaming.\n\nJulio said all he knew was that his son was somewhere in New York. As soon as we hung up, I called Ziesemer at Catholic Charities, which has a government contract to provide legal services to the unaccompanied minors in the city. I asked whether she\u2019d heard of Brayan.\n\n\u201cWe do know this kid,\u201d Ziesemer quickly responded, \u201cbut were not aware he was separated from his father.\u201d\n\nZiesemer was audibly shaken. \u201cUntil you called, all I had was his name on a spreadsheet,\u201d she said.\n\nZiesemer immediately arranged to have Brayan, who had been placed in a temporary foster home, brought to her office. Her experience told her not to expect much from their first interaction, partly because Brayan was likely to be afraid, and partly because he was only 4. So she tried putting Brayan at ease by opening a box of crayons and a Spider-Man coloring book.\n\nHe warmed up to her quickly, putting down his crayons to show her his Spider-Man moves and squiggling lines on a piece of paper when she asked whether he knew how to write his name. But, as Ziesemer expected, he was too young to make sense of what had happened to him on the border, much less explain it to an adult he\u2019d just met. And his lisp made it hard for Ziesemer to understand the few things he could tell her.\n\nAfter the meeting, she sounded both exasperated about having to grill a tiny child and terrified that there might be other children like him buried in her spreadsheets.\n\n\u201cWe, and the caseworkers and the consulates, do what we can to fill in the gaps and figure out where these kids came from,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that means days and weeks go by with a child not knowing where his parents are and vice versa. And it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. It shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d\n\nAfter Ziesemer\u2019s meeting with Brayan, I traveled to Pearsall to meet Julio. He said he\u2019d fled the country with Brayan because street gangs had threatened to kill him after finding out that he reported one of their members to the police. His wife and stepson stayed behind because there wasn\u2019t enough money to pay for everyone to come. I spoke to his wife, who told me she was hiding out at her parents\u2019 house because she didn\u2019t want to be home if gang members came looking for her husband.\n\nIn photos his relatives sent, Julio looked sort of like a cop, stocky with a crew cut. But after a month in detention, he looked pale and deflated. He wore navy blue detention garb and his dark brown hair was wet, though neatly combed. He didn\u2019t have any tattoos, which are common among Central American gang members.\n\n\u2018Ice box\u2019\n\nThrough tears, Julio told me he\u2019d replayed the days since his arrival at the border in his mind, trying to make sense of why authorities took away his son. Julio and Brayan had been taken to the \u201cice box,\u201d a notorious air-conditioned cellblock that is the first stop for most immigrants intercepted at the border. Brayan developed a high fever and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment. A Border Patrol agent who drove Julio and his son scolded Julio for bringing a small boy on such a harrowing trip. Could that be the reason they took his son away? Was it because the agents had looked at the color of Brayan\u2019s hair and didn\u2019t believe he was the boy\u2019s father?\n\nJulio wonders whether he had been fooled into signing a document at the hospital \u2014 they were all in English \u2014 surrendering his rights to his child. Was it because he\u2019d once been arrested for a robbery in El Salvador, but exonerated two days later when authorities realized they had the wrong person? Why would they consider him a danger to his child?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I told him that Julio learned his child had been taken from him because Border Patrol agents suspected he was a gang member. The news hit him hard, and it was confounding because at the same time the CBP had deemed him a gang member, another agency within DHS had found that his asylum petition, in which Julio claims he was a victim of gang violence, was persuasive enough to be heard by an immigration judge.\n\nIn early October, Julio had met with an asylum officer for what\u2019s known as a credible fear interview. According to the report of that interview, which Julio provided to ProPublica, the asylum officer not only asked him why he fled El Salvador, but whether he had a criminal record. Among the questions were: Have you ever committed a crime in any country? Have you ever harmed someone for any reason? Even if you did not want to, have you ever helped someone else harm people? Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime? Have you ever been a member of a gang?\n\nJulio answered no to all of them. The asylum officer who conducted the interview deemed Julio\u2019s account credible, and, even more significantly, indicated that she had been provided no derogatory information or criminal records that would automatically bar Julio from winning asylum.\n\nThe discrepancy reflects differences in the legal standards for asylum and family separation. While the asylum officer\u2019s decision is subject to review by a judge, the Border Patrol\u2019s decision to take away Julio\u2019s child was not.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what information, if any, they really have on Julio,\u201d his attorney, Evangelista, said. \u201cThey have total discretion when it comes to separating him from his child. They can do what they want. And they don\u2019t have to explain why.\u201d\n\nJulio said his own father had abandoned him when he was about Brayan\u2019s age. Then his mother left for the United States when he was 7. He said he vowed never to do the same thing to Brayan, which is why he didn\u2019t leave the boy behind in El Salvador. He wonders now whether that was a mistake. In every phone call with Brayan, Julio says, he feels his son slowly slipping away.\n\n\u201cHe tells me: \u2018You\u2019re not my Papa anymore. I have a new Papa,\u2019\u201d Julio said of his son, adding: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even call me Papa. He calls me Papi. I never taught him that word.\u201d\n\nHappening again?\n\nBack in New York, Ziesemer said she worries family separations may be beginning all over again.\n\nSitting with Brayan in her office, she said, brought back the faces of the 400 or so separated kids who had shuffled through over the summer. As Catholic Charities\u2019 point person during the crisis, she said she came to know every single one of those kids by name. One 9-year-old girl went into a full panic attack when she was asked to step into a room without her sister because she thought Ziesemer was going to take her sister away like officials had taken her mother. \u201cAt one point, we had to have a meeting with the entire office to explain why the conference room was full of all these wailing kids,\u201d she said.\n\nCatholic Charities, the ACLU and several other large immigrant advocacy groups took the lead in putting the families together again; working the phones to find parents who were still in immigration detention and dispatching colleagues to Central America to track down parents who had already been deported. In addition to the \u201chuge, heavy lift\u201d of reunification, Ziesemer said, there was a crush of calls and emails from Congress, consulates and the media \u2014 all seeking information about the separations.\n\nZiesemer said she and her team worked around the clock for months, and though there are still several dozen kids awaiting reunification, she thought things were winding down. That\u2019s when she began seeing new cases, like Brayan\u2019s, which had some of the same hallmarks of the old ones.\n\nZiesemer didn\u2019t know much about Brayan, except the little bit of information she\u2019d gotten from him during their meeting. So I shared with her some of the things I\u2019d learned about him from his family: that he could eat four hard-boiled eggs in one sitting; that he loved Lightning McQueen, a character from the Pixar movie \u201cCars\u201d; and that he had a dog, Lucky, whom he insisted on seeing during every WhatsApp video call with his mother. His grandmother in Austin had fixed up a bedroom for him, filled with Mickey Mouse dolls, remote-control cars and winter coats. I told Ziesemer how distraught Brayan\u2019s father was that his son called him \u201cPapi.\u201d\n\n\u201cA couple of weeks is a long time for a kid his age,\u201d she said about Brayan. \u201cThey start losing attachments to people, even their parents.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published by ProPublica.

AP's Eric Tucker explains. (Nov. 27) AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Robert Mueller (Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to stop legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired by President Donald Trump, even after Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, held open the possibility of bringing it up for a vote earlier Tuesday.\n\nMcConnell told reporters Tuesday afternoon that if senators attempted to bring up the bill for expedited consideration, he would reject it \u2013 a move he has already done once this month.\n\n\u201cThis is a solution in search of a problem, the president is not going to fire Robert Mueller,\" McConnell said. \"We have a lot of things to do to finish up this year without taking votes on things that are completely irrelevant to outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI probably would\u201d block the bill if senators tried to put it up for a vote Wednesday, McConnell said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Cornyn signaled a potential change in the position of Republican leaders who have previously rejected a push by outgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake to allow a vote on the Mueller legislation on conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt's radio show.\n\nFlake has threatened to oppose Trump's judicial nominees unless the Senate holds a vote on the Mueller bill. That could set up a hurdle for the nominees since the Arizona Republican senator sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee where Republicans have a narrow 11-10 majority.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some judges on the calendar now that we can pass even if we don\u2019t have Senator Flake\u2019s support. But we can\u2019t get them out of the Judiciary Committee, so we\u2019re going to be working with Senator Flake to see what he needs in order to lift his hold,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cThere is a possibility we will have a vote on the Mueller, so-called Mueller protection bill.\u201d\n\nIn April, the Judiciary Committee voted through bipartisan legislation that would protect Mueller from being fired, 14-7. But McConnell has refused to bring up the bill.\n\nFlake and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., requested an expedited vote on the legislation one week later, but that was rejected by McConnell.

(Photo: Chris Todd, EPA-EFE)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a state with a long history of discrimination and racial polarization, Mike Espy has tried to carefully walk the line on race as an issue in the Mississippi Senate contest, even after his Republican opponent\u2019s comments about a \u201cpublic hanging\" went viral and put her campaign on the defense.\n\nEspy, a Democrat, is in an uphill battle to unseat Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith in Tuesday\u2019s special election.\n\nEspy, an African-American, has criticized Hyde-Smith for making controversial comments, but has backed off repeatedly hammering herover remarks that evoked the state's brutal history of lynchings. He has mostly left that to others as he tries to court black and white voters.\n\nEspy hasn\u2019t shied away from the issue of race, but he hasn\u2019t made it or Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments a focus, said Rickey Hill, a retired chair of the Political Science Department at Jackson State University.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that you don\u2019t want to do in a state where racism still animates very well and racial voter polarization is a fact of life \u2026 is run a campaign that takes a side that would alienate voters who see themselves as being moderates and who would want to consider you,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tight race is the last Senate contest this election cycle. If Hyde-Smith wins Tuesday, Republicans will have 53 seats next year instead of the 51 they now hold.\n\nBut the runoff has grabbed the national spotlight primarily because of Hyde-Smith's comments, which have sparked an uproar for what some in the conservative state say are racial overtones.\n\n\u201cRace is woven through the fabric of so many things here,\" said John Bruce, chair of the Political Science Department at the University of Mississippi. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have dog-whistle politics here. It already is all present.\u201d\n\nEspy, 64, a former congressman and U.S. secretary of agriculture in the Clinton administration, is running for the seat of Republican Thad Cochran, who retired in April.\n\nHyde-Smith, 59, a beef cattle farmer, former state agriculture commissioner and a former state senator, was appointed to fill the remaining two years of Cochran\u2019s term. Hyde-Smith, who is white, is the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress.\n\nSen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., joined her colleagues to celebrate National Seersucker Day on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on June 4, 2018. (Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY)\n\nHyde-Smith is favored to win, but the gap has closed in recent weeks in the wake of her comments caught on video.\n\nIn one video at a Nov. 2 event, Hyde-Smith says of a supporter, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\"\n\nThe comment went viral with critics saying it conjured up images of lynchings and Mississippi's racist history. A photo of Hyde-Smith wearing a Confederate soldier's cap has also surfaced.\n\nThen Democrats accused Hyde-Smith of supporting voter suppression, citing a video in which she can be heard saying that \"maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult\" for some people to vote, and \"so I think that's a great idea.\"\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s campaign has said she was making a joke and the video was selectively edited. Hyde-Smith accused her opponents of trying to twist her \"public hanging'' remarks and has since apologized to \"anyone who was offended\" by the comment.\n\n\"There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever,\" she said at a Nov. 20 debate.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has defended Hyde-Smith, calling her \u201csomeone who is respected in the Senate.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe felt very badly, she certainly didn't mean that and, you know, it was taken a certain way but she certainly didn't mean it,\u2019\u2019 Trump told reporters outside the White House Monday as he headed to Mississippi for two rallies for Hyde-Smith.\n\nPolitical experts said Espy has focused mostly on touting himself as a moderate and vowing to work across the aisle on issues important to Mississippi, including more access to affordable rural health care.\n\nAnd while he would make history as the first African-American elected to Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction, he has mostly let others hammer home that message.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not running as the African-American candidate, he\u2019s running as the sensible alternative to Trump world, who happens to be a Democrat,\u201d said Bruce, adding that Hyde-Smith's comments exacerbated the race issue. \u201cThis is a state that has, I would argue, probably the highest level of polarized voting in the country, so before the candidates are even determined, race is a factor here.\u201d\n\nJennifer Duffy, senior editor at the nonpartisan Cook Report, said race will also be a major factor in voter turnout.\n\n\u201cThe contest is going to be decided on race one way or the other because Espy\u2019s path to victory is dependent on African-American turnout,\" she said.\n\nShe said African-Americans made up 33 percent of the voters on Nov. 6, but Espy would need at least 36 percent of the electorate to be African-American for him to win Tuesday. He would also need again to capture about 16 percent of non-Republican white voters.\n\nDuffy said the question is whether Hyde-Smith\u2019s recent comments could spur more African-Americans to show up at the polls.\n\n\u201cHas it angered African-American voters enough to drive them to the polls?\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrat Mike Espy, who is running for a Senate seat in Mississippi, talks to a crowd at a fundraiser Oct. 3, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY)\n\nIn the wake of those comments, some companies, including Walmart and Major League Baseball, asked Hyde-Smith to return their campaign contributions.\n\nAnd some of Espy\u2019s advertising strategy aims to capitalize on Hyde-Smith\u2019s \"public hanging\" comments.\n\nOne ad quotes a self-described Republican saying people are \u201cscared to death\u201d about what she\u2019ll say next. One notes that Fortune 500 companies like Walmart have \u201crejected her divisive words.\u201d And another says Mississippi \u201ccan\u2019t afford a senator who embarrasses us and reinforces the stereotypes we\u2019ve worked so hard to overcome.\u201d\n\nBut those ads ran far less often between Nov. 7 and Nov. 24 than commercials attacking other parts of Hyde-Smith\u2019s record, according to figures provided to USA TODAY by Kantar Media/CMAG. About three-quarters of the spots Espy aired during that time criticized Hyde-Smith for her lobbying work, for using campaign funds as state agriculture and commerce commissioner to buy a car, and for supporting an economic development package that included help for a beef processing plant that failed.\n\nLikewise, the ads run by a Democratic super PAC have criticized Hyde-Smith\u2019s record on health care.\n\nEspy does try to apply the same label \u2013 disaster \u2013 in both types of ads. Those on her \u201cpublic hanging\u201d comment say she\u2019s \u201cso embarrassing, she\u2019d be a disaster for Mississippi.\u201d Ads about other parts of her record call her \u201cethics disaster Cindy Hyde-Smith.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Mike Espy, left, challenges an answer from appointed U.S. Sen.

Solis, AP)\n\nThe smallest share of Espy\u2019s ads \u2013 about 8 percent \u2013 focus on his promise to \u201cfind common ground and bring us together again.\u201d\n\nHe reaches back to Mississippi\u2019s divisive past in a spot that starts with a shot of the Lincoln Memorial as Espy repeats Abraham Lincoln\u2019s admonition as the nation was on the brink of civil war to \u201cseek the better angels of our nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time, Mississippi, not to forget the past, but to forgive our trespasses,\" Espy says, \u201cand come together to move Mississippi forward.\u201d\n\nDuffy said there isn\u2019t a \"huge upside\" for Espy to talk about race.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to drive attention to it himself. Other people are doing it for him,\" she said. \u201cDoes his focus on it create a backlash? Does it sort of wake up white voters in a way that would not be especially helpful to him on Election Day?\"\n\nInstead, she said, the discussion has been mostly among voters, interest groups and the media \"without the candidate having to come out and be so direct about it and risk looking like he\u2019s whining or he\u2019s only running on race.\"\n\nStephen Rozman, chair of the Political Science and History Department at Tougaloo College, said Espy has handled the issue of race well. He noted that Espy, a moderate, got the support of white voters when he successfully ran for Congress.\n\n\"He\u2019s playing his hand well,\" said Rozman, citing a recent ad where someone other than Espy mentioned Hyde-Smith\u2019s \"public hanging\" comment. \"For Espy to push race himself too much, I think that would backfire.\"\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes, USA TODAY, and Luke Ramseth, Clarion Ledger.\n\nMore: A look at Mike Espy before US Senate runoff: People over party, keeping head down\n\nMore: A look at Cindy Hyde-Smith before US Senate runoff: Trump's choice, guarded public image\n\nMore: Nooses found hanging from trees at state Capitol\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/27/espy-focuses-health-care-and-other-issues-instead-race/2120137002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/25/mississippi-senate-race-runoff-hyde-smiths-ads-greater-than-espys/2078354002/", "text": "Mike Espy (left) and Sen.

Ads accuse her of being cozy with the health insurance industry, voting for \u201cjunk\u201d insurance policies and not backing protections for people with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nBut the label Espy is trying hardest to stick on Hyde-Smith is \u201cdisaster,\u201d a word used in most of his ads, whether talking about her controversial comment or other parts of her record.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a disaster for Mississippi,\u201d the announcer says in one spot, while promising that Espy \u201cwill work across party lines for us.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith, the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress, was appointed to the seat earlier this year to replace retiring Sen. Thad Cochran. He stepped down early for health reasons.\n\nBesides the public hanging comment, Hyde-Smith has more recently been in the spotlight through news reports that she attended a segregation academy in high school and praised a Confederate soldier's attempts to \"defend his homeland.\u201d\n\nIn her ads, Hyde-Smith tries to turn voters\u2019 attention away from her \u2013 and to the conservative values she says they share.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about me,\u201d she says in an ad. \u201cIt\u2019s about you and what you believe in.\u201d\n\nThose beliefs, she says, are the \u201cright to life,\u201d lower taxes, a stronger military, securing the border, protecting the 2nd Amendment and \u201call constitutional freedoms.\u201d\n\nHer ads, as well as those aired by Republican groups, feature attacks on Espy\u2019s record. Republicans ding him for being indicted on bribery and fraud charges while serving as President Bill Clinton\u2019s Agriculture Secretary, although the ads don\u2019t say that he was acquitted. Some ads also mention the money Espy received from an Ivory Coast dictator as a lobbyist.\n\nBut the spots also hit hard on the themes Trump emphasized during his campaigning for Senate Republicans this year.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats get control, they will raise your taxes, flood your streets with criminal aliens, weaken our military, outlaw private health insurance and replace freedom with socialism,\u201d Trump says in an ad paid for by Hyde-Smith and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nImmigration, supporting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Trump's agenda were the themes most often mentioned in Republican ads.\n\nHyde-Smith and her allies have spent about $2.7 million on broadcast and cable ads compared to $1.2 million spent by Espy\u2019s side from Nov. 7 through Nov. 24.\n\nBut the gap between the two sides narrows when comparing the number of spots, instead of the amount of money spent. (Ad rates vary depending on whether the candidate or an outside group is doing the buying, and vary based on when and where they air.)\n\nOf the more than 8,700 ads aired, Republicans paid for 57 percent.\n\nBoth sides appealed to supporters over the weekend for final contributions to keep the ads coming.\n\n\"I know there's still a real chance here to flip a red Senate seat,\" Maryland Sen.

Mia Love, was officially defeated in a similarly close contest in Utah, losing to Democrat Ben McAdams by 694 votes.\n\nThe Republican incumbents appear headed for a split in the two yet-to-be-called races in New York.\n\nAnalysis: Election results: Red states get redder, blue districts bluer, the partisan divide deeper\n\nMore: Democrats won House midterms by largest margin since Watergate scandal, report says\n\nIn NY 27, a heavily Republican district, Democrat Nate McMurray made allegations Wednesday of irregularities in the voting process in his challenge for the seat held by Rep. Chris Collins, who is scheduled to stand trial in 2020 after pleading not guilty earlier this year to charges of insider trading.\n\nBut Erie County Republican Election Commissioner Ralph Mohr said it was \u201cmathematically improbable\u201d for McMurray to win, reported the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, a member of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nAfter the last of some 10,000 absentee ballots were tallied Tuesday, Collins led McMurray by 1,384 votes with about 900 affidavit ballots and an unknown number of military and federal ballots left to be counted.\n\nCollins has declared victory.\n\nSo has Anthony Brindisi, who, as of Tuesday night, led Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney by more than 4,000 votes with about 1,900 additional ballots to be counted in NY 22, the Democrat & Chronicle reported.\n\nIf those two New York races hold, the Democrats will have flipped 39 seats to gain control of the House.\n\nA 40th seat shouldn\u2019t be ruled out, Silver of FiveThirtyEight tweeted Wednesday, referring to the race between Republican Rep. David Valadao and Democrat TJ Cox in California's 21st Congressional District.\n\nWhile the AP has declared Valadao as the winner, Cox pulled within 447 votes with some 15,000 ballots left to be counted, the Fresno Bee reported Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe @AP and most of the networks still have this race called for Valadao, which is just super lazy (and that's about the nicest thing I can say about it). Should have been uncalled 10 days ago,\u201d Silver tweeted.\n\nLater Wednesday, Decision Desk HQ retracted its call of the CA 21 race, prompting another tweet from Silver.\n\n\u201cAt least *somebody* got this right \u2026,\u201d he wrote.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/21/election-2018-house-races-question/2084065002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/02/midterms-stacey-abrams-brian-kemp-voter-suppression-controversy-minority-turnout/1807527002/", "text": "CLOSE Unless you\u2019re a political junkie, it\u2019s not easy keeping track of the seats up for election.

Nathan Deal. Kemp's office enforces it.\n\nCritics say exact match laws affect black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters disproportionately, because they are more likely to haveethnic names that produce more errors when entered into databases.

The watchdog group accused Kemp of carelessly administering an election where there was an \"unsecure, unreliable voter registration database.\"\n\n\"According to plaintiff\u2019s complaint,\" Totenberg wrote, \"information in the state\u2019s voter registration server, used at the polls to determine whether voters are eligible to vote, is vulnerable to multiple security breaches and exploitable by manipulation of voter data.\"\n\nShe noted that 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the midterms.\n\nCommon Cause Georgia sought to ensure all provisional ballots cast by eligible voters were properly counted.

That only became official on Tuesday.\n\nThe first black Republican woman elected to Congress in 2015, Love lost her bid for a third term by less than 700 votes against Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams, adding to the Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives come January.\n\n\"This race was about connecting with Utah,\" McAdams said while declaring victory on Monday night before the final results were posted by the state. \"This race was about who was best positioned to serve Utah and working to not get it caught up in a national, partisan election.\"\n\nThe race had remained too close to call for The Associated Press for two weeks. State election officials are scheduled to certify results on Monday.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Love said she planned to call McAdams but didn\u2019t indicate if she would concede or congratulate him. She said she\u2019s traveling with family for Thanksgiving and won\u2019t speak about the race until Monday.\n\n\"Regardless of how you voted, I want to express my sincere appreciation to you for engaging in the process,\" Love said. \"It is one of many reasons this is the greatest country on earth.\"\n\nLove was among House Republicans targeted in the hours after the midterms by Trump, who suggested their defeats were at least in part because of their refusal to embrace his presidency.\n\nMore: \u2018I won against President Obama and Oprah Winfrey\u2019: Trump still sees silver lining in midterms\n\nRelated: Win while losing?

She went on to defeat Democratic challenger Doug Owens in 2014 and again in 2016.\n\nMcAdams is just the fourth Democrat that Utah has elected to the U.S. House since 1990.\n\nHe pitched himself as a solid moderate, a strategy aimed at independent voters who account for nearly 4 in 10 voters in the largely suburban Salt Lake City district and designed to overcome his built-in disadvantage in a district where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by nearly 3 to 1.\n\nThough solidly conservative, Utah voters have long been uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s brash style and his comments about women and immigrants. That anxiety is especially pronounced in the suburbs of blue-leaning Salt Lake City, and McAdams\u2019 mayor position gave him solid name recognition with voters.\n\nWith McAdams' victory, Democrats have flipped nearly 40 seats \u2013 including all seven in Orange County, California, once a GOP stronghold \u2013 to win control of the U.S. House.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/20/election-2018-mia-love-donald-trump-loses-utah/2075473002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/20/cindy-hyde-smith-apologizes-hanging-comment-mississippi-senator/2075212002/", "text": "CLOSE At a Monday news conference about an endorsement by the National Right to Life Committee, Gov.

That could help Trump get more of his appointees confirmed \u2013 including another Supreme Court justice, if a vacancy occurred. And it could help the GOP block efforts to remove Trump from power should House Democrats pursue an impeachment.\n\nBut based solely on vote tallies, the GOP gain of two won't amount to much given that 60 votes are still needed for virtually all controversial bills. Trump has pressed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to change Senate rules to lower that threshold, but the Kentucky Republican has rejected the idea in the past.\n\n\"My age-old question is whether the president and his team have learned anything at all about the legislative process, especially when it comes to the Senate,\" said Jim Manley, who worked for former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. \"Trump, for one, can\u2019t get over the fact that McConnell's never going to change the rules of the Senate.\"\n\nMost appointments, even high-profile nominees like Justice Brett Kavanaugh, can win confirmation with a simple majority.\n\nOn the other hand, two more votes could take the pressure off centrist Republicans such as Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom helped tank the GOP-led repeal of the Affordable Care Act last year, Binder said.\n\n\"Their votes are conceptually less pivotal now that Republicans hold more seats,\" she said.\n\nNervous Republicans\n\nThat dynamic will be especially important to watch given the 2020 Senate map.\n\nIn the reverse of this year, it is Republicans who will be defending most of the Senate seats up for election in 2020. But unlike the challenge many Democrats faced in seeking re-election in states carried by Trump, only two Republicans will be up in states Trump lost in 2016.\n\nOne of those senators, Collins, drew the ire of Democrats who had supported her before she voted to confirm Kavanaugh. An online campaign to defeat Collins has raised more than $3.7 million even though she does not yet have an opponent.\n\n\u201cSusan Collins has to repair her relationship with the Democrats in Maine,\u201d said Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker.\n\nColorado Sen. Cory Garner represents a state recently considered winnable by either party but now looks increasingly Democratic. And Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis will have to hold on to states won by both Trump and President Barack Obama.\n\nBut because McConnell now has a few more votes to spare, it will be easier to give vulnerable senators a pass on a tough vote, said John Hudak, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cIn a Senate with 51 votes, you don\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d Hudak said. \u201cIn a Senate with 53 votes, you do.\u201d\n\nFewer moderate Democrats\n\nRepublicans defeated three of the Democrats who voted with them most often, leaving fewer opportunities to pad their slim majority with help from the other side.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is more polarized,\u201d said Steve Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nDefeated Democrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, for example, worked with Republicans this year to ease some of the banking regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. Donnelly and Heitkamp sided with fellow Democrats on votes that split the parties slightly less than two-thirds of the time in the last two years, according to Congressional Quarterly.\n\nBut two other line crossers \u2013 West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Montana\u2019s Jon Tester \u2013 survived. And Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who has voted with his party about 60 percent of the time since winning a special election in 2017, will face the voters in his conservative state again in 2020, giving him an incentive to showcase a moderate record.\n\nWhile Baker said there\u2019s always opportunities for bipartisan action in the Senate, such islands of cooperation are rare in today\u2019s sea of partisanship.\n\n\u201cThe American people just have to be satisfied with the fact that there are very, very few areas of legislation in which there is going to be cooperation between Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Baker said.\n\nLooming presidential election\n\nVoters may be ready to tune out elections for a while, but with as many as a dozen Democrats in the Senate already eyeing a presidential run, it will be difficult to separate all but the most routine legislation from the 2020 campaign.\n\nFrom high-profile names such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to lesser known figures like Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the Senate floor is likely to become a proving ground for Democratic opposition to Trump.\n\nThe sheer number of Senate Democrats believed to be considering a run for president could wind up having practical implications for the chamber's schedule, too.\n\nDemocrats considering a run will need to attend fundraisers in California and New York, taking them away from Washington with increasing frequency. As they move closer to primary season, they'll have to devote considerably more time to early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThat could prove a headache for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on close votes.\n\n\"It\u2019s definitely going to be a situation in which he\u2019s got to herd rabbits or cats \u2013 or some other creature that doesn't want to be herded,\" Baker said.\n\nTrump loyalists\n\nTwo Republican senators who had publicly criticized Trump \u2013 Arizona\u2019s Flake and Tennessee\u2019s Corker \u2013 retired rather than seek re-election this year. Corker\u2019s successor, Marsha Blackburn, tied herself closely to Trump, as did the Republicans who defeated Donnelly, Heitkamp and McCaskill.\n\nThat could ramp up the already-high Trump loyalty in the GOP caucus.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Scott, who narrowly defeated Nelson, did try to put some distance between himself and Trump in his campaign advertising \u2013 despite being one of the first prominent Republican politicians in the nation to embrace Trump's candidacy in 2016.\n\n\u201cWhen I don\u2019t agree with what President Trump does or says, I\u2019ve said it,\u201d Scott said in a Spanish-language ad that aired at low levels. \u201cMy only commitment is with you.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Mitt Romney dine at Jean Georges restaurant in New York City in November 2016, when Trump was still the president-elect. (Photo: Drew Angerer)\n\nBut the incoming senator who may be most likely to cross swords with Trump is Utah\u2019s Romney. During the 2016 presidential race, Romney called Trump \u201ca phony\u201d and \u201ca fraud\u201d and said he didn\u2019t have the temperament or character to be president. While Trump endorsed Romney\u2019s Senate bid, Romney did not run as a Trump acolyte and represents a state where a lot of Mormon voters are conservative but have been put off by Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cThis is a former (GOP presidential) nominee who has a strong political base of his own and could really be a thorn in the side of the president,\u201d Hudak said.\n\nPlus, the midterms were the first time the president really lost, and the way Republicans will respond will be interesting, he added. Although Republicans expanded their Senate majority while losing the House, they could've had a much better night given how many seats Democrats were defending.\n\n\"Even though Democrats came up short,\" Hudak said, \"it does speak a little to vulnerability that exists in the Trump brand, in that Republican coalition, that McConnell has to be wary of.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/20/donald-trump-faces-senate-challenges-despite-gop-midterm-wins/2059265002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/19/florida-election-state-investigating-fraud-altered-forms/2061237002/", "text": "CLOSE Senator Bill Nelson has called for a recount.

AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump supported Ron DeSantis, who won Florida's governorship. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe 2018 midterm election in Florida left Republicans (mostly) triumphant and Democrats (largely) reeling.\n\nRepublicans will occupy the three most prominent statewide positions, governor and both U.S. Senate seats, while Democrats have been left wondering how they lost races polls had them favored to win.\n\nNow the focus shifts to 2020. Can the GOP maintain its momentum in the nation's most important presidential swing state? Can Democrats regroup by building on some beneath-the-radar wins that could bear fruit two years from now?\n\nRepublican Ron DeSantis scored a win over Democrat Andrew Gillum for governor, and Republican Rick Scott unseated three-term Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson \u2013 two crucial victories for President Donald Trump as he prepares for his re-election fight in a state he narrowly captured two years ago over Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"There are silver linings and warning signs for both parties\" looking ahead to 2020, said Susan MacManus, retired political science professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa.\n\nFor Democrats, the demographics of a more diverse and younger electorate are \"working their way\" in favor of a bluer state, she said.\n\nFor Republicans, the just-completed midterm elections showed how their effective turnout strategy could work again two years from now, she said. The six counties with turnout above 70 percent \u2013 Baker, Collier, Franklin, Jefferson, St. Johns and Sumter \u2013 went for DeSantis over Gillum and Scott over Nelson.\n\nAlthough the political landscape looks overcast for Sunshine State Democrats, the picture isn't entirely bleak for them. And even though Republicans may have to work even harder for a Trump re-election in two years, they have the advantage of a solid structure in place and a candidate who ignites their base.\n\nMuch will depend on who wins the Democratic nomination for president. There are plenty of tea leaves for both parties to read today.\n\nHere's why Democrats might bounce back in 2020:\n\n\u2022Though they lost high-profile races, they made gains at the grass-roots level.\n\nDemocrats picked up one of the four state offices on the ballot when Nikki Fried won the race to be agriculture commissioner. That may sound like a minor post, but it's the first time a Democrat captured a state Cabinet post since Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink won in 2006.\n\nMore: Here's why the midterm elections were both good and bad for Donald Trump's re-election\n\nMore: 'This was not just about an election cycle': Andrew Gillum concedes in Florida governor's race\n\nIn what may be a more telling picture of the state trending blue, Democrats gained seats in the state Legislature and in the congressional delegation, flipping seats in battleground areas such as Miami-Dade County.\n\nAt the start of this decade, 19 of the 25 members of Congress representing Florida were Republicans. Come January, 13 of the 27 will be Democrats.\n\n\u2022Better-then-normal turnout could portend trouble for Republicans in 2020.\n\nDemocrats traditionally struggle to turn out their voters in Florida and around the country. But they did a decent job of generating voter enthusiasm this year. Exit polls suggest minorities and young voters are energized over issues such as gun violence, immigration and health care.\n\nFor example, young voters made up about 6.8 percent of early and absentee voting in Florida. In 2014, they made up about 4.8 percent. The share of early voters 65 and older fell to 44.6 percent, down from 47.8 percent in 2014.\n\nHispanics favored Gillum and Nelson over their Republican opponents, and the Democrats each got about 54 percent of the vote, according to exit polls.\n\nTrump's hard-line immigration stance has alienated many Hispanic voters, and that could be a problem for him in Florida in 2020.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tours a neighborhood damaged in Hurricane Maria Oct. 3, 2017, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nTens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who fled their home island after Hurricane Maria sat out November's election, according to registration trends. But there is plenty of time for Puerto Rican voters who located to Florida to register, MacManus said. Trump infuriated many Puerto Ricans when he blamed officials on the island for the slow federal response to Maria and questioned the death toll.\n\n\u2022State voters approved a change that should grow the pool of Florida Democrats.\n\nThe passage of an amendment to the State Constitution on Nov. 6 will give about 1.4 million nonviolent felons who have completed their sentences the right to vote. Minorities comprise a disproportionately high portion of the prison population, so that's likely to expand the potential pool of Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nIt's not clear how many will actually register to vote. Even a fraction could make a difference in a state known for razor-thin margins. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 by fewer than 113,000 votes out of more than 9.5 million cast, or 1.2 percent.\n\nDerrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, said he expects they will make an impact in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strong likelihood that the landscape in the state of Florida will change based on candidates truly appealing to the needs and interest of that constituency,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans have their own reasons for optimism:\n\n\u2022Continued control of the Governor's Mansion (and the Legislature) and now both Senate seats means Republicans will enable the party to promote an agenda that dovetails with Trump's policies.\n\nAndrew Gillum concedes to Ron DeSantis in Florida's gubernatorial race. (Photo: WTSP)\n\nHaving the governor in the state be from the same party is a \u201creally, really big help\u201d for a presidential candidate, because governors have powerful statewide organizations, said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nEven though the U.S. House is in Democratic control, Republicans have a role to play, said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Panhandle congressman who is among the president's most ardent supporters.\n\n\"We need to defend an administration that's going to be under constant attack,\" he said. \"If the Democrats are able to go up and down the court, scoring uncontested layups, it becomes very difficult for the president. I intend to play a lot of tough defense.\"\n\n\u2022Turnout was high among Democrats but also solid for Republicans.\n\nFlorida saw its highest overall voter turnout rate since 1994, according to the Florida Division of Elections. Unofficial voting numbers show the state had a 62 percent turnout rate, compared with a 51 percent turnout rate in 2014 and 49 percent in 2010.\n\n\"In a year where we saw states like Arizona and Michigan showed a slightly bluer hue, Florida Republicans continued to demonstrate turnout potential that's really good news for the president,\" Gaetz said. \"The reddest parts of Florida were turning out at a rate of 75 percent and up. It shows that the Trump fire is burning bright red among his coalition.\"\n\n\u2022Florida has a habit of backing presidential re-elections.\n\nSince Franklin D. Roosevelt's first re-election bid in 1936, sitting presidents have won all but two of their re-election contests: Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H. W. Bush in 1992.\n\nTrump considers the state a second home, given the presence of his Mar-a-Lago Estate in Palm Beach that he dubbed \"the Winter White House.\" That should mean plenty of face time with Florida voters.\n\n\u2022Florida Republicans generally run a better turnout model.\n\nDemocrats are known for attracting third-party groups into the state to lead voter registration efforts a few months before an election.\n\nThat can lead to a lot of sign-ups but not always turnout. Democrats had more than 4.9 million voters as of Sept. 30, compared with nearly 4.7 million Republican voters, state records show.

In California, the Democratic advantage stands at an overwhelming 45-8.\n\nDemocrats had targeted seven Republican-held seats in California that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. They claimed six of those, capitalizing on President Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the state and attacking incumbents who voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and/or supported the 2017 tax bill, which limited deductions in high-tax states like California.\n\nMore: Win while losing?

Latinos make up 35 percent of the Orange County population and Asians 21 percent. Non-Hispanic whites account for 40 percent.\n\nThe county\u2019s increasingly diverse demographics and changing politics over the past two decades had allowed Democrats to make enough inroads that they entered the election with three incumbents \u2013 Linda Sanchez, Lou Correa and Alan Lowenthal, all runaway repeat winners \u2013 and to foster dreams of adding to their delegation.\n\nBut given the region\u2019s history, not even the most optimistic Democrats could have expected a sweep.

She will replace Nelson as the only Democrat holding statewide office in Florida.\n\nRepublican former congressman Ron DeSantis will be the state's next governor after Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum conceded Friday afternoon. A machine recount that ended Thursday showed DeSantis with a 32,463 vote lead.\n\nThe state cabinet is set to certify the election results Tuesday.\n\nFor Nelson, 76, this could be the final act in a career in public service that began in 1972, when he was elected to represent the Space Coast in the Florida Legislature. He subsequently served in Congress and as the state\u2019s insurance commissioner before being elected to his first of three terms to the Senate in 2000.\n\nNelson's loss to Scott was only the second loss in a career that has included 14 election victories.\n\nBut Nelson's longevity was not enough to overcome the millions of dollars of Rick Scott's personal fortune that the former health care CEO poured into the race. Scott used a good portion of the $64 million of his own money he put into the campaign on TV ads decrying Nelson as a \"career politician.\" One noted that the Ford Pinto was the most popular car in America when Nelson was first elected.\n\nScott, on the other hand, has run for office just three times, winning two terms as governor before seeking the Senate seat. The fact the he won each race by a margin of 1.2 percentage points or less illustrates how closely divided the state's voters are.\n\nConfusing Broward ballot\n\nIn fact, had it not been for a poorly designed ballot in Broward County, the Senate race likely would have been even closer than it was.\n\nIn Broward, a Democratic stronghold, some 30,000 voters didn\u2019t record a choice in the Senate, an unusually high number for such a high-profile race.\n\nNelson's recount hopes rested on discovering that those \"undervotes\" were the result of machine-counting errors. But both machine and manual recounts showed that in the vast majority of cases, voters simply left the race blank.\n\nThe most likely reason: The Senate race, the first listed, was on the lower left corner of the ballot, below voter instructions, a placement that could have made it easy to overlook, especially for infrequent voters not well-versed in the election process.\n\nHad those 30,000 voters followed the rest in the county, who gave nearly seven out of 10 votes to Nelson, the margin would likely have been in the hundreds, not thousands, and possibly could have given Nelson the win.\n\nLow voter turnout in heavily Republican Bay County, which was devastated by Hurricane Michael in October, likely also depressed Scott's vote, making the final margin closer than it otherwise would have been.\n\nThis year's drama marked the second time in less than two decades that the rest of the country looked on while Florida struggled with elections results.\n\nIn 2000, the legal battles over the presidential election results dragged on until the middle of December until the U.S. Supreme Court shut down recount battles, essentially handing the state \u2014 and the White House \u2014 to George W. Bush who won the Sunshine State by 537 votes over Al Gore.\n\nThis year's recounts went much smoother in part due to changes in state law that detailed when and how recounts were to be conducted. The lack of such uniform standards were at the heart of many of the legal battles in 2000.\n\nThe state and federal governments also helped counties upgrade aging election equipment following the 2000 election.\n\nBut the strain on the system of conducting three simultaneous statewide recounts \u2014 never before had even one been done \u2014 and legal battles over absentee and provisional ballots showed there are still improvements to be made.\n\nIncoming Florida Senate President Bill Galvano said Friday that lawmakers will discuss changes to the state\u2019s election laws.\n\nBy the next election cycle, he said, \u201cvoters are going to want to have more in terms of assurance that their votes are going to be properly counted.\u201d\n\nRecount issues\n\nAmong the problems that arose during the recount:\n\nHow to verify signatures on absentee and provisional ballots? Currently, election officials simply compare signatures on such ballots with signatures they have on file. But lawsuits pointed out that signatures change over time and election officials have no particular expertise in handwriting analysis.\n\nHow long should absentee ballots be accepted? Those coming from within the United States must be received by 7 p.m. on election day while those coming from overseas can be accepted up to 10 days after the polls close. In both cases, the ballots need to be postmarked no later than election day.\n\nThe time line for recounts. Election workers toiled around the clock for days after a machine recount was ordered in the Senate, governor and agriculture commission races. Three of the state's 67 counties didn't complete their recounts by the state-mandated deadline. Manual recounts were much smoother, but those only involved the 90,000 or so ballots showing no or too many candidates marked in a race, not the more than 8 million cast statewide.\n\nA bigger issue is the state's election equipment. The new technology introduced post-2000 to replace antiquated voting machine is now also becoming outdated. Mechanical problems played a role in Palm Beach, Broward and Hillsborough counties missing the machine-recount deadline.\n\nGrants from the state and federal governments helped counties upgrade their voting equipment following the 2000 election, but counties have been responsible for maintaining and upgrading it, costs they typically put off for as long as possible.\n\n\"They are going to have to deal with technology and how to pay for it,\" said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida. \"Now the counties have to pay for it and election equipment is very expensive.\"\n\nScott will join fellow Republican Marco Rubio in the Senate Jan. 3. It will be the first time since Reconstruction that Florida has had two GOP senators.\n\nLt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera will fill out the final days of Scott's term as governor until DeSantis takes office Jan. 8\n\nIt's unclear what's next for Nelson, who grew up in Brevard County.\n\nHe has continued to call the Space Coast \"home\" throughout his career, though he hasn't lived here since being elected Insurance Commissioner in 1994. He still owns land in Malabar, though he lives in Orlando when not in Washington.\n\nContact McCarthy at 321-752-5018 or jmccarthy@floridatoday.com\n\nMore: Profile of Rick Scott\n\nMore: Florida recount: Things smoother than in 2000, but fixes needed; Gillum ends campaign\n\nMore: Florida recount: Hand recount complete in Broward in what is not a good sign for Nelson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/18/florida-recount-sunday-update-rick-scott-bill-nelson/2048541002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/18/florida-recount-some-fixes-still-needed-gillum-concedes/2048129002/", "text": "CLOSE With voting recounts in full swing, you might be worried that your ballot got lost in the action of it all.

Sixty-four of the state's 67 counties were able to complete machine recounts of millions of ballots in three statewide races, though there had never been such a recount in even one race before.

I suspect we will be just as tightly divided in two years, so the possibility of very close elections are quite high, if you ask me.\"\n\nWhat this year's election exposed was not so much problems with Florida's election laws, but with aging voting equipment.\n\nFollowing the 2000 election, state and federal aid helped counties replace outdated election machinery such as punch-card systems.\n\nSorted ballots are seen Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Fla. The Florida recount continued Monday in Broward County. (Joe Cavaretta /South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) (Photo: Joe Cavaretta, AP)\n\nBut individual counties are responsible for maintaining and upgrading election equipment. They have historically been reluctant to spend money to do so until forced to.\n\nProblems with aging equipment first popped up on election night and continued through the machine-recount process:\n\nBroward County was slow to report election day totals from some voting precincts because of transmission issues. It did finish its machine recount in the nick of time, but it took 17 minutes to upload the results to the state putting it two minutes past the deadline, leading the state to reject the numbers.\n\nPalm Beach County\u2019s tabulating machines went on the fritz during the recount due to age and overwork causing it to not finish its machine recount.\n\nThe electricity went out in Hillsborough County during a machine recount, resulting in an 846-vote deficit. Officials there didn't submit the recount numbers because of the discrepancy.\n\n\"Counties need to catch up with their technology,\" MacManus said.\n\nShe also pointed to another voting problem that is out of the hands of lawmakers or election officials: Voter education.\n\nThe recount in Broward County, which the Nelson campaign pointed to as key to closing the gap with Scott, was mostly finished after just two hours Friday. (Photo: Sarah Jarvis, news-press.com)\n\nTens of thousands of potential voters move to Florida each year and the election systems here often are different from those in their home states. Voter registration drives sign up an additional tens of thousands of new voters each year.\n\nMacManus cited the problems with the Senate race in Broward as a case where lack of voter education added to the election woes.\n\nMore: Florida election recounts bring out 'darker angels' as partisans sling unfounded claims\n\nSome 30,000 voters there cast no vote in the Senate race. A poorly designed ballot, with the Senate contest tucked into the lower left corner below voter instructions, made the race easy to overlook. But knowledgeable voters would have known that they didn't vote in the high-profile race and looked more carefully at their ballots. After all, 684,000 people in the county did manage to cast a vote in the race.\n\nMacManus said parties need to do more to teach newly registered voters how to actually vote.\n\n\"It is not enough just to register them,\" she says. \"You really have to take time to educate and mentor them.\"\n\nEmployees at the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office count ballots from the Mid-term election, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, in Lauderhill, Fla.

Late arriving absentee ballots and provisional ballots aren't counted until days after polls close. And technology glitches inevitably lead some precincts to be slow in reporting results. That's why election results aren't certified until 10 or more days after voting ends.\n\nMore: This is why US election ballots routinely go missing\n\nBut in most elections, those late votes aren't going to change a race and a winner can be unofficially declared within a few hours of polls closing.

(Photo: GEORGE ANDREASSI/TCPALM)\n\nAs Florida's statewide hand recount rumbles on, Sen. Bill Nelson's chances of winning re-election are growing increasingly dim.\n\nA couple of court losses late Thursday and \u2013 perhaps most damaging \u2013 Friday's hand recount in Democrat stronghold Broward County that did not appear to give Nelson the lift he needed.\n\nThen came word late Friday afternoon that the vast majority of the ballots in the hand recount across the state are unlikely to help Nelson because voters chose to skip the Senate race altogether. That recount was considered a linchpin of Nelson's already uphill strategy to victory.\n\nMost experts say Nelson now needs a miracle to erase Republican challenger Rick Scott's 12,603-vote lead, formalized after Thursday's machine recount ended. A hand recount of disputed ballots that were set aside because the machines had trouble counting them is now being conducted.\n\n\"He can pull this off but everything has to go his way,\" said Charles Zelden, a political science professor and election recount expert at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. \"And any one small glitch can be enough to keep him from winning.\"\n\nAt this point, Nelson has until Sunday at noon to pull off his long-shot bid. Barring a court ruling, that's the deadline for canvassing boards at each of Florida's 67 counties to report their final recount tallies to the state.\n\nMarc Elias, Nelson's lead recount attorney, admitted to reporters late Thursday that a lot of factors have to break the senator's way for victory. But he also was confident they would, given that Scott's initial lead on the night of Election Day shrank from about 60,000 votes (out of nearly 8.2 million cast) to fewer than 13,000.\n\n\"It's never been our view that there was going to be one silver bullet that was going to change the margin in the race,\" Elias said. \"If you look at each stage where the margin has shrunk, it has not shrunk because of one big thing, but rather it has shrunk from a number of smaller things. As we move forward I continue to expect that (12,603) margin to go down and disappear entirely.\"\n\nHere's a look at some of the obstacles facing Nelson:\n\nThe hand recount is not going his way\n\nThere are about 65,000 questionable ballots statewide to examine in the hand recount, according to the Florida Secretary of State's office. Nelson would have to win about 60 percent of those votes to take the lead.\n\nThe recount is examining ballots with \"overvotes\" (where the machine did not tabulate it because both candidates were chosen) and \"undervotes\" (where the machine did not tabulate it because no one was chosen).\n\nA human review of an overvote ballot could show if the voter intended to pick one candidate over the other. The belief was that could help Nelson because the county overwhelmingly voted for him against Scott, who is Florida's governor, and those disputed ballots would break the same way.\n\nCLOSE Florida's battle for the U.S. Senate is headed to a legally required hand recount (Nov. 15) AP\n\nThe recount in Broward was finished after just two hours Friday. Election officials didn't immediately release results, but the speed with which the recount was conducted suggests most of the ballots were undercounts. That doesn't help Nelson because those are votes that won't be counted.\n\nIn fact, the news got even worse for Nelson. Of the roughly 65,000 votes being reviewed, 62,257 \u2013 or about 95 percent \u2013 were undervotes. With fewer than 3,000 votes up for grabs, Nelson will have to find \"silver bullets\" in other places to scrounge up the difference.\n\nCourts offer little remedy\n\nNelson will need the courts to side with him in his effort to give counties more ballots to count and more time to tabulate them.\n\nThe senator gained one court victory earlier this week when U.S. Chief Judge Mark Walker ordered Secretary of State Ken Detzner to give voters whose ballots were tossed because their signatures didn\u2019t match what was on file until 5 p.m. Saturday to \"cure\" their ballots. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Nelson after a GOP appeal.\n\nBut the judge denied a request by Nelson to extend Thursday's 3 p.m. machine recount deadline. Palm Beach County was unable to finish in time. So now Nelson is seeking a hand recount of each of the nearly 585,000 ballots in the county \u2013 a process that likely would take weeks.\n\nWalker also denied a request to give election monitors more flexibility in divining voter intent during the hand recount. And he threw out a motion by the Florida League of Women Voters to have Scott recuse himself from the recount process and step down as governor.\n\nElection workers place ballots into electronic counting machines at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Florida. (Photo: Joe Cavaretta, AP)\n\nStill pending was Walker's motion on a lawsuit from VoteVets demanding that domestic vote-by-mail ballots, which must be received by the day of the election, be treated the same as overseas ballots, which can be received as late as 10 days after the election.\n\n\u201cCitizens in the U.S. should be given the same opportunity as expatriates living abroad,\u201d Elias said.\n\nTime running out\n\nNelson has less than a week to pull off a win. Or at least buy more time.\n\nCounties have until noon Sunday to finish their hand recounts on the Senate race. Then on Tuesday, the state Elections Canvassing Commission, consisting of the governor (who has recused himself) and two cabinet members, meets to certify the Nov. 6 election official returns.\n\nThere\u2019s also a Nov. 30 deadline for any candidate, voter or taxpayer to contest election results in circuit court.\n\nZelden, the election expert, likened Nelson's chances to a player in a card game betting all his chips on a specific card being pulled from the deck.\n\n\"He's literally depending on it to be the queen of hearts,\" Zelden said. \"Anything else, he loses. Sometimes it shows up, but the odds are pretty good it's not going to.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/16/florida-recount-bill-nelsons-chances-beating-rick-scott-slim/2027236002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/16/ethics-panel-rebukes-gop-aide-over-sexual-harassment-aide/2027455002/", "text": "Rep.

But to Spanberger, who grew up there, it felt as though there had been \u201can awakening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this ever-sort-of-unfolding thing,\u201d she told USA TODAY. \u201cThere were protests, there were vigils. When the travel ban came out, there were people in the street.\n\n\u201cI participated in everything,\u201d she said at a coffee shop in Washington, D.C., during a break in new-member orientation.\n\nSpanberger beat the incumbent Rep. Dave Brat by 2 percentage points. In hindsight, her win makes sense, given the dynamics of this election.\n\nWell over half of the winners in House districts the Democrats flipped were women. Democrats like Spanberger made inroads with women and wealthy voters in the suburbs with a campaign message that was laser-focused on affordable health care. And several like Spanberger \u2013 a former undercover Central Intelligence Agency operative \u2013 ran on their military and national security backgrounds.\n\nSpanberger may have been helped in part by some factors specific to her race. Redistricting in 2016 brought some different voters into the district, and the GOP candidate at the top of the ticket \u2013 Senate hopeful Corey Stewart \u2013 could have been a drag on down-ballot contests.\n\nBut on the whole, what happened in her district is not only emblematic of this election but of political shifts across the USA for the last decade, leading up to the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIn this district, the tea party ousted the Republican establishment,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic consultant who grew up in the district. \u201cThen Trump took over the Republican Party, and now the suburbs have thrown Trump\u2019s \u2018yes men\u2019 out. It\u2019s the story of the last decade in politics that can be seen in Richmond.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Spanberger\u2019s victory reflects those dynamics:\n\n\u2018Laws of political gravity\u2019\n\nFor more than a dozen years, the GOP\u2019s Eric Cantor represented the district, winning re-election with ease. He rose to become the House Majority Leader in 2011 after helping engineer the Republican takeover of the House.\n\nBut shortly after the tea party revolution helped flip control of the House, it became a force in the district\u2019s 2014 GOP primary, with former economics professor Dave Brat ousting the more mainstream Cantor in a stunning upset.\n\nFormer House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., speaks during a news conference June 11, 2014, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Cantor lost a primary challenge from tea party candidate Dave Brat in 2014. (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)\n\nBrat joined the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus and spent much of his time in the chamber trying to pull legislation farther right, even when that conflicted with GOP leadership's goals. Brat declined multiple requests to comment for this story.\n\nMo Elleithee, founding executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, said Brat \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be sustainable\u201d in office.\n\n\u201cThe laws of political gravity were going to pull him down at some point. The question was just, when? And it turns out the political winds along with a very disciplined candidate in Spanberger were able to tap into that,\u201d said Elleithee, a longtime Democratic strategist who worked on multiple statewide Virginia races.\n\nThe district is conservative, reliably voting for GOP presidential candidates, including Trump. Republicans should have never lost, but in this election, most of the \u201cbetter\u201d Republican incumbents \u201csurvived the landslide and the worst candidates did not,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster.\n\n\u201c(Brat) defeated a very popular incumbent, and there were Republicans who were never really happy with that,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster. \u201cAnd he never really worked the district as well as he could have. ... That\u2019s one of the seats that the GOP will target in 2020 to win back.\u201d\n\nRep. Dave Brat, R-Va., gestures during a debate with Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger at Germanna Community College in Culpeper, Virginia, on Oct. 15, 2018. Spanberger beat Brat on Election Day. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)\n\n\u2018Women are in my grill\u2019\n\nAfter a couple of contentious town halls turned rowdy, Brat\u2019s team \u2013 and other Republicans across the country \u2013 eventually decided to stop hosting them altogether. Instead, Brat focused on smaller more controlled events and meetings, but he was still frustrated by what had happened.\n\n\u201cSince Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go,\u201d Brat was caught on tape saying in early 2017.\n\nWelcome to the \u201cyear of the woman.\u201d Wait, that was 1992, when a then-record 47 women were elected to the House. This may be the \"year of the badass woman.\" You know, those who sling credentials such as former military helicopter pilot or rock climber or, in Spanberger's case, former undercover CIA operative who happens to also be a mom and activist.\n\nSpanberger was one of the suburban moms who had been at the town halls. She was upset with Brat\u2019s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt was among the many reasons that motivated a record number of women to run for office this year, resulting in more women lawmakers who will serve next Congress than ever before.\n\nNewly elected Democratic members of the House of Representatives Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, center, Mikie Sherrill, left, of New Jersey and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania take a selfie in front of the U.S. Capitol following an official class picture of new representatives on Nov. 14, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images)\n\nOf the 88 newcomers to the House, 35 are women and all but one of those women is a Democrat. In Virginia, all three of the districts that flipped from red to blue were won by women.\n\n\u201cFor many of them, I think there was an effort to have a really personal connection with voters,\u201d Spanberger said.\n\nWomen notably brought all aspects of their lives to the campaign trail, including their children. Spanberger did that, but not without hesitation. She didn\u2019t want to be \u201ctoo much of a mom\u201d on the campaign trail, worrying that she\u2019d have to justify the balancing act to voters. She also didn\u2019t want to take away their privacy too early.\n\nBut as the campaign went on, she began including her children in conversations with voters. And it was an asset.\n\n\u201cI started hearing people say, \u2018I love that you have this experience and that you\u2019re so passionate \u2013 and that you\u2019re a mom,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I heard it from men and women.\u201d\n\nHealth care front and center\n\nSpanberger didn\u2019t hesitate when asked what was important to voters this election: health care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the number one,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, after spending the last eight years running from the issue, Democrats ran on it this election, forcefully. They capitalized on Republicans\u2019 failed efforts to pass legislation last year that would have unraveled many of Obamacare\u2019s popular consumer protections, done away with the individual mandate and overhauled the insurance market.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like the cost of Obamacare or the instability that it created, but because Republicans were so public about it, the Republicans came to own the issue,\u201d said Luntz, the GOP strategist and pollster. \u201cI think it\u2019s not something they expected at the time.\u201d\n\nOverturning the 2010 law had been a potent campaign issue for Republicans \u2013 including Brat \u2013 until this election. A major pillar of his 2014 campaign was the promise to repeal the health care law \u2013 and it was critical to his undoing.\n\nSpanberger had been considering a run but made her decision the day of the House vote. She remained almost singularly focused on the topic during her campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople in this district were far less interested in Donald Trump\u2019s latest conspiracy theory than they were with protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And that\u2019s what you saw in suburban districts all across the country,\u201d said Ferguson, the Democratic strategist.\n\nMore: Midterm results 2018: How Trump\u2019s 2016 election set the stage for the female wave\n\nMore: Wealthy suburban voters, women: How Democrats captured the House in the 2018 midterms\n\nSuburban backlash\n\nSpanberger\u2019s support in a swanky part of the Richmond suburbs seemed to catch people by surprise, she noticed.\n\n\u201cPeople would say, \u2018Oh my Goodness, I\u2019ve seen your signs on River Road,\u2019\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cThere\u2019s that level of \u2018Who would have thought?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn another era, those signs likely would have boosted a Republican. But the suburbs are changing.\n\nWhen he was Virginia\u2019s governor from 2006 to 2010, Tim Kaine said, the 7th District was the most Republican and had the highest turnout in congressional races. But he wasn\u2019t surprised when Spanberger won.\n\n\u201cThe suburbs are growing faster than the rural parts of the district, and suburban voters are more and more likely to go Dem,\u201d said Kaine, now a Democratic U.S. senator representing the state.\n\nDemocratic candidate to represent Virginia's seventh Congressional district in the US House of Representatives Abigail Spanbergerposes for a picture with supporters after declaring victory over Republican incumbent Representative Dave Brat, at an election night watch party in Richmond, Va.

The store caters to female, well-educated, upper-class shoppers \u2013 the exact demographic a USA TODAY analysis found propelled Democratic wins across the country.\n\nSuburban areas are drawing more college-educated professionals who may be fiscally conservative but are socially liberal, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. The party of Donald Trump isn\u2019t a fit for many of these voters, he said.\n\n\u201cInstead of a polished, well-educated fiscal conservative party, they\u2019re faced with an in-your-face, rude and offensive party and that\u2019s quite a contrast,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s caused people to rethink their affiliations. That\u2019s not the (way of the) suburbs.\u201d\n\nAs Trump took hold of the party, suburban voters walked away, Ferguson said.\n\n\u201cEveryone who was looking for a blue wave or red wave \u2013 a lot of what we saw was a suburban tsunami,\u201d he said. \u201cThis district was a big part of that.\u201d\n\nContributing: Matt Wynn\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/16/midterm-elections-2018-spanberger-win-shows-last-decade-politics/1999019002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/15/election-2018-democrats-flip-another-house-seat-california/2021499002/", "text": "CLOSE House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says she has \"overwhelming support\" among fellow Democrats to become the next House speaker.

(Photo: Chris Carlson/Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Democrat Katie Porter captured a Republican-held U.S. House seat Thursday in the heart of what once was Southern California\u2019s Reagan country, extending a rout of the state\u2019s GOP House delegation that might not be over.\n\nPorter\u2019s upset in Orange County is a sign of changing times in a region once known nationally as a GOP fortress. The coastal county southeast of Los Angeles was home to President Richard Nixon, and President Ronald Reagan once likened it to a Republican heaven.\n\nPorter, a law professor and protege of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, defeated Republican Rep. Mimi Walters, who was re-elected in a walkover just two years ago in the 45th District. The latest update to the vote count gave Porter 51 percent and a 6,203-vote lead.\n\nPorter, 44, campaigned on an unabashed liberal agenda and in direct opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities: She advocates overturning his tax reform package, supports universal health care, and endorses mandatory background checks on all gun sales and a ban on so-called assault-style weapons.\n\nRelated: Kyrsten Sinema helped turn reliably red Arizona purple.

The district has a 7-point Republican registration edge, and Walters was re-elected in 2016 by 17 points, even though Hillary Clinton carried the district by 5 points in 2016.\n\nThe heavily suburban district was one of seven targeted by California Democrats after Clinton won them two years ago.\n\nWith Porter\u2019s win, Democrats have picked off three GOP seats either all or partly in Orange County, and they are threatening to win another district where votes continue to be counted.\n\nIf Democrat Gil Cisneros wins that undecided race against Republican Young Kim in the 39th District where GOP Rep. Ed Royce is retiring, the county once considered Republican holy ground won\u2019t have a GOP representative in Congress.\n\nIn returns Thursday, Cisneros climbed into a 941-vote lead after Kim held the early lead.\n\nEarlier, Democrat Mike Levin captured the seat long held by retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which cuts through the southern end of the county, and Democrat Harley Rouda ousted 15-term Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in the county\u2019s coastal 48th District. Democrats also seized GOP-held seats north of Los Angeles and in the agricultural Central Valley.\n\nWith Porter\u2019s win, Democrats will hold at least a 44-9 edge in California U.S. House seats. They hold every statewide office, a supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7-million advantage in voter registration.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/15/election-2018-democrats-flip-another-house-seat-california/2021499002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/politics/elections/2019/01/01/elizabeth-warren-explores-run-white-warren-explores-run-white-house-2020/2455357002/", "text": "None\n\nSen.

Time may be running out for lesser-known hopefuls to compete in a crowded field.\n\nAs the field of presidential hopefuls landing in Iowa continues to grow, the three Democratic contenders most preferred by Iowans still aren't in the race.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke led the field in a December Iowa Poll, but none has formally announced their intentions yet.\n\n\"I think those are the big three that everyone\u2019s waiting for,\" said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County Democrats.\n\nWhile those three remain on the sidelines, a slew of other candidates have kept busy hiring Iowa staffers and holding rallies in their quests to unseat Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nPresidential contenders Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, Kirsten Gillibrand and Juli\u00e1n Castro all campaigned or will campaign in Iowa this month. Amy Klobuchar will visit Iowa just days after declaring her candidacy.\n\nEnthusiasm building around the Democrats already running risks leaving behind candidates who are still flirting with potential runs. But Dumkrieger said Sanders and Biden both have plenty of name recognition and support from previous Iowa caucus bids that likely affords them more time to make a decision.\n\nMany view O'Rourke, 46, who narrowly lost to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November's election, as a \"young rock star,\" he said.\n\nBut time may be running out on him and any other lesser-known candidates who want to compete in a very crowded field.

I\u2019m looking for fresh ideas.\u201d\n\nO'Rourke, a previous three-term congressman, gained celebrity status as he propelled a long-shot campaign into a close contest against Cruz. Cruz won the Iowa Republican caucuses in 2016 before losing the GOP nomination to Trump.\n\nWhile O'Rourke has not responded to invitations from local Democratic Party officials, he told Oprah Winfrey on Feb. 5 that he plans to decide whether to run by the end of the month.\n\n\"I've got to tell you, and you can tell, I'm so excited at the prospect of being able to play that role,\" he said.\n\nStill, he has his work to do here: About a third of likely Democratic caucusgoers said they didn\u2019t know enough about him to form a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him, according to a December Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll. Just 4 percent of likely caucusgoers said Biden and Sanders were unknown to them.\n\nA national poll from Morning Consult released this week showed Biden led with 29 percent of respondents choosing him as their preferred candidate for the Democratic nomination. He was trailed by Sanders and California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nOn Monday, the McClatchy news service reported that interviews with 31 Democratic operatives revealed deep pessimism about a potential Biden run. That story cited the former vice president's age (76), his policy baggage and the field of fresh faces igniting passion in the party.\n\nThose concerns were echoed by others in Waterloo. Democrat Darcy Stoen, 51, of Evansdale, said she liked Biden because of his record as vice president and as a Delaware senator.\n\n\u201cBut his age worries me a little bit,\u201d said Stoen, who attended a Booker campaign event there Friday. If Biden runs, she said, she\u2019d like to see him pick a younger candidate like Booker as his running mate, and commit to serving just one term before handing over the reins to a new generation.\n\nMore:\n\n'For me, it matters who can get people in the middle'\n\nAfter Warren held a roundtable discussion on labor issues in Davenport, Iowa, Sunday evening, Nieel Aditya Shinde, 26, identified the Massachusetts senator as one of his top choices.\n\n\u201cSince Bernie hasn\u2019t announced, I guess I\u2019m supporting Warren for now,\" said Shinde, of Bettendorf, Iowa.\n\nHe's drawn to both senators because they have targeted the nation's financial industries.

He said Sanders \"set the standard\" in 2016 by advocating for a $15 minimum wage, taking on Wall Street and lobbying against the influence of corporate donors and political action committees\n\n\"I would caucus for her and I would fight for her to be president,\" said Humphreys, 37, \"but I\u2019m hopeful for Bernie.\u201d\n\nAt a stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Sunday, Robin Jackson Miller, 40, of Hiawatha, Iowa, said she saw similarities between Warren and O'Rourke.\n\n\"He\u2019s just very inspiring and seems to be able to talk to people in a way that gets them interested in politics, gets them excited and gets them to care about things,\" she said.\n\nAt the same event, Kelly Kindl said she wanted to vote for a female presidential candidate. But she's also eyeing others, including O'Rourke, Harris and Buttigieg. But she's particularly interested in the former vice president.\n\n\"He might have a bigger draw, just because of his history in politics,\" said Kindl, 40, of Marion, Iowa.\n\n'This thing's going to change a half a dozen times by caucus day'\n\nMost presidential campaigns must start from scratch in building out an organization in Iowa. Biden and Sanders can lean on previous volunteers and organizers.\n\nBut staffing may be another question.\n\n\"People are excited about Bernie. They would love to work for him, but they need a paycheck,\" said Evan Burger, an organizer at Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement who worked on the Sanders campaign in 2016. \"I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve hit that point yet where people are going to have to start dropping off, but at some point we\u2019re going to run into that.\"\n\nHe said he believes a core group of supporters and staffers will hold out for Sanders.\n\n\"It's not realistic and it's not fair to expect every single person who was with the candidate last time to be with them this time,\" said Pete D'Alessandro, who directed Sanders' 2016 Iowa caucuses campaign.\n\nD'Alessandro said he had no insight on whether the independent Vermont senator would seek the Democratic nomination again.\n\n\"It's not too hard for me to wait an extra month,\" he said. \"I have no problem with that. If he's in, I'm in.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, rallied Iowa Democrats in Ames, Iowa, on Sunday, Oct. 21, 2018, on behalf of J.D. Scholten, left, who is challenging U.S. Rep.

(Photo: Chris Jorgensen, via Iowa State Daily / Special to the Register)\n\nHe acknowledged that Sanders would struggle to match the magic of the campaign in 2015 and 2016. The silver-haired senator, now 77, arrived in Iowa in the last caucus cycle polling in the single digits, but gained enough support to nearly best Clinton. He lost the 2016 Iowa caucuses by one-fifth of 1 percentage point.\n\nPreviously, Sanders positioned himself as a more liberal alternative to Clinton, who was widely viewed as the favorite from early on. This time, he would have to compete with Warren and anyone else trying to court the Democrats furthest to the left, D'Alessandro said.\n\nInstead of the two distinct lanes occupied by Clinton and Sanders in 2016, voters and the press may group this year's candidates into four or five distinct groups, he said. The the size of the field may lead some to downplay Iowa and focus on other early states like New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada and California.\n\n\"Look, this thing's going to change a half a dozen times by caucus day,\" D'Alessandro said.\n\nThe 'biggest field in Iowa caucuses history'\n\nAt this point in the race, few Iowa Democrats have committed to one candidate, said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Polk County Democrats.\n\nSo he thinks it's possible that Sanders, Biden and O'Rourke all could join the race.\n\n\"If the mayor of South Bend, Indiana (Buttigieg) thinks he has something to offer, I'm pretty sure a former presidential candidate, a previous vice president and somebody who almost beat Ted Cruz think they can compete,\" he said.\n\nBagniewski doesn't expect the field to shrink soon.

John McCain's last term representing Arizona, which ends in 2022.\n\nKelly is the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in a 2011 mass shooting that left six dead in Tucson, Arizona. Since that attack, Giffords and Kelly have been prominent advocates for gun control.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to enter the field ahead of 2020 and is widely seen as a formidable candidate, given his biography and likely ability to raise the millions of dollars needed to take on the GOP's established candidate, Sen. Martha McSally.\n\nMcSally, who formerly served in the House, was appointed to the seat by Gov. Doug Ducey after she narrowly lost her campaign for Arizona's other Senate seat to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in the 2018 midterm election. She is considered one of the most vulnerable Republican senators heading into the 2020 election.\n\nProfile: Seven years after shooting that changed everything, Kelly still working on what comes next\n\nMcSally is a former Air Force pilot and was the first woman to fly combat missions. Kelly was a pilot in the Navy.\n\nBoth veterans will fight to fill the seat of a legendary Navy pilot who was shot down and held as a prisoner of war by North Vietnamese communists for five and a half years.\n\nKelly's announcement comes a few days after former attorney general Grant Woods \u2013 a Republican who joined the Democratic Party and is a fierce critic of President Donald Trump \u2013 announced he would not be getting in the race. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is also considering a run for the seat.\n\nKelly announced his candidacy in a video he shared on social media that largely focused on his biography and his marriage to Giffords.\n\n\"You know, I thought then that I had the risky job,\" the former astronaut tells his wife as they discuss her shooting. \"Turned out that you were the one who had the risky job.\"\n\nCLOSE Mark Kelly and his wife, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, responded to the mass shooting in Las Vegas. They called for \"more than prayers\" from President Trump. USA TODAY\n\nHe credited his wife for giving him the drive to run for the Senate.\n\n\"I learned a lot from being an astronaut. I learned a lot from being a pilot in the Navy. I learned a lot about solving problems from being an engineer. But what I learned from my wife is how you use policy to improve people's lives,\" he said.\n\n\"I care about people. I care about the state of Arizona. I care about this nation,\" he said. \"So, because of that, I've decided that I'm launching a campaign for the United States Senate.\"\n\nThe video ends with Kelly and Giffords sitting on a couch, \"Damn the torpedoes,\" he says.\n\n\"Full speed ahead,\" they say together.\n\nHe received a degree in marine engineering and nautical science from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, graduating with highest honors in 1986, according to his biography with NASA. He also has a master\u2019s degree in aeronautical engineering.\n\nDuring his military career, Kelly picked up awards ranging from the Distinguished Flying Cross to the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. He flew 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm and logged more than 5,000 hours in 50 different aircraft, NASA reported.\n\nKelly announced his retirement from NASA in June 2011, five months after Giffords was shot.

Elizabeth Warren suggested her 2020 Republican opponent may not be President Donald Trump.\n\n\"When we get to 2020 \u2013 Donald Trump may not even be president. In fact, he may not even be a free person,\" she said in her first eastern Iowa stop of the day.\n\nIt marked the first time Warren has targeted the president directly while at an event in the early caucus state. During a multi-day tour earlier this year, Warren hardly talked about Trump at all \u2013 and she even avoided mentioning his name.\n\nDespite taking an early direct jab at the president on Sunday, Warren said Trump is the symptom of a bigger problem. She quickly transitioned into talking about her values \u2013 something she later told the Des Moines Register will be the focus of her campaign.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks in the Veterans Memorial Building in downtown Cedar Rapids on Sunday, Feb. 10, 2019, the day after announcing her run for president.

On the one hand, she said, the investigation is almost finished, and on the other, a completed investigation will let Congress \u2013 and the public \u2013 see all available evidence before it's taken to a vote.\n\n\"If we go down that path, we're going to need to help pull this country together and have as many people as possible understand that it was a legitimate process based on facts that came from an independent investigation,\" Warren said.

People in Iowa have asked hard, interesting, engaged questions.\n\n\"I'm going to be here as often as I can.\"\n\nAs she had before, Warren spoke in Iowa of her upbringing, her fight to make America work not just for the rich and powerful, and her efforts to take corruption out of politics by ending lobbying and requiring tax return disclosures by all candidate for federal office.\n\nIn Iowa City, home to the University of Iowa, she opened by proposing debt-free college for all and reducing the burden of student loan debt on existing borrowers.\n\nShe spoke of the $50-a-semester college she attended to become a teacher. It was that affordable education that pushed her into the middle class, unlike many young people today whose debt is \"crushing their dreams,\" she said.\n\nBut student loan debt isn't the only thing hurting Americans today, she said, listing off the increased costs of housing, health insurance and child care, despite stagnant wages.\n\n\"I'm not somebody who picked up this issue because it polled well,\" she told the Register. \"This is what I've been working on for my whole life. It's been about documenting the hollowing out of America's middle class. It's about how people work harder than ever but the path is getting rockier \u2013 and even rockier for people of color.\n\n\"That's been my life's research.\"\n\nDespite being one of the first to announce an exploratory committee for president, Warren already faces high-profile opponents contending for their party's nomination. She announced on New Year's Eve she was exploring a run, but didn't formalize the campaign until this weekend.\n\nSens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker recently announced their bids and have been in Iowa. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced her bid Sunday.

She opposed most of Trump's Cabinet nominees, including Jeff Sessions, Betsy DeVos, Steven Mnuchin, Rick Perry and Ben Carson. But, according to FiveThirtyEight, she voted with Trump 31.5 percent of the time, the highest among the five Democratic senators officially running in the primary.\n\nKlobuchar is more moderate than some of her primary opponents on a couple of Democratic issues.

Doesn\u2019t it seem to you that it\u2019s now time that we and our government build schools, not walls?\u201d\n\nBecerra in his brief address gave Democrats credit for blocking Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, which led in December to a 35-day partial government shutdown, the longest such closure in U.S. history. Becerra said the Trump administration has sowed confusion, hostility and disorder.\n\nBecerra, 61, has quickly emerged as a top Trump administration adversary since being appointed in 2017. His office has filed at least 45 lawsuits against Trump policies related to immigration, energy policy and the controversial immigration-status question proposed for the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\nPresident Donald J.

He has threatened another shutdown, however, if Congress does not provide funding ahead of his Feb. 15 deadline.\n\nTrump on Tuesday again urged Congress to approve funding for the border wall, painting an ominous picture of the impact of illegal immigration. He warned that another migrant caravan is once again making the trek through Mexico to the U.S. border, calling it a \u201ctremendous onslaught.\u201d\n\nHe also claimed illegal immigration was disproportionately affecting working-class Americans who \u201care left to pay the price\u201d while \u201cwealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind gates and walls and guards.\u201d\n\nBecerra, who spoke from his alma mater, C.K. McClatchy High School in Sacramento, said Democrats are willing to debate comprehensive immigration reform, but he vowed that Democrats would fight any effort by the president to issue an emergency declaration to fund his wall, as Trump has threatened.\n\n\u201cNot only is it immoral, it\u2019s illegal,\u201d Becerra said. \u201cWe are prepared to reject this foolish proposal.\u201d\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tapped Becerra to give the Spanish-language response. The Democratic leaders also chose former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to give the English-language response to Trump's national address.\n\nIn a statement, Schumer said Becerra \"embodies the promise of America,\" while Pelosi praised him as \"a towering champion of equal justice and a tireless fighter for every American\u2019s right to quality, affordable health care.\"\n\nBecerra, who once was the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, left Congress to become the state\u2019s attorney general after Kamala Harris was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. Becerra often touts his biography in explaining why he has made it his mission to defend the rights of immigrants. His mother is an immigrant from Guadalajara, Mexico, who married his father, a U.S. citizen, who often traveled between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra discusses various issues during an interview with The Associated Press, in Sacramento, California, Oct. 10, 2018.

The announcement came the same day authorities said they charged a man with killing an 11-year-old boy near Los Angeles in 1990.\n\nIn Linda\u2019s case, authorities said they got a hit last month from a genealogical database that matched a DNA sample taken when her body was found strangled in a ditch a day after she went missing.

The next morning, her body was found.\n\nAuthorities said they never gave up the search for her killer, even after decades passed and her parents had died. The suspect\u2019s DNA profile was uploaded to a criminal database in 2001 but there were no hits for years, authorities said.\n\nThey got a hit this year on a genealogical database, leading investigators to obtain a DNA sample from Neal, and it matched, Spitzer said.\n\nMore: 39 years later, man charged in cold-case killing of high school student Michelle Martinko\n\nMore: DNA on napkin leads to charges in 32-year-old cold case\n\nNeal lived in Southern California at the time of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s killing and moved to Florida soon afterward, where he changed his name, Spitzer said.

(Photo: Colorado Department of Corrections)\n\nCorrection & Clarification: A prior version of this story had the incorrect year for when James \"Little Man\" Thompson served in the Army. It was 1967.\n\nDENVER \u2013 A drug-dealing Army deserter and convicted murderer has finally been caught after assuming another man's identity and living as him for 30 years.\n\nThe story of James \"Little Man\" Thompson, now 72, winds from eastern Oklahoma through the Vietnam War, to Colorado jail cells and to the inside of a federal courthouse in Denver, where in a shaky hand, Thompson finally signed his real name to the court records.\n\nIt all started in Oklahoma City, prosecutors said, when Thompson, a dealer, traded drugs for a customer's identification card. At the time, Thompson had already spent four years in prison and been convicted of going AWOL from the Army in 1967 at the height of the Vietnam War. Thompson acquired the man's ID sometime in the 1980s, and moved to Colorado a few years later, according to court records.\n\nOklahoma didn't mandate photos on driver's licenses until 1977, and experts say it's likely Thompson was able to take advantage of the fact that few states had sophisticated and interlinked databases until decades later. Thompson apparently began using the other man's name sometime around 1984, authorities said.\n\nAt the time Thompson joined the Army, it was common practice to fingerprint recruits, but those records were likely never entered into a computerized database. And with Oklahoma and Colorado's criminal-record systems not connected back then, Thompson's first Colorado arrest linked his fingerprints to his new, assumed name.\n\nToday, the federally run National Crime Information Center lets police agencies across the country verify fingerprints and names nearly instantly.\n\n\"It was much easier before,\" said Henry Bagdasarian, founder of the California-based Identity Management Institute. \"It was primitive at the time, now we have different databases of maybe DNA or fingerprints.\u201d\n\nBut while Thompson was apparently good at pretending to be someone else, he was equally bad at avoiding trouble. He kept committing crimes and kept getting caught, all under his old customer's name. He got Social Security cards in the other man's name at least four times, and then got a Colorado driver's license \u2013 with his own picture on it \u2013 in 1995.\n\n\"Offenders are incarcerated using the name they are sentenced under,\" said Colorado Department of Corrections spokeswoman Adrienne L. Jacobson. \"Any other known names are added to the offender's profile as an alias, but their incarceration name does not change.\"\n\nColorado state corrections officials know Thompson under at least 14 aliases and with at least three different birth dates. His convictions include second-degree murder, drug dealing, and forgery, and he spent the better part of his life in Colorado behind bars or on probation or parole.\n\n\"While the defendant started using a different name, he did not veer from his habitual criminality,\" prosecutors said in a court filing.\n\nTo add insult to injury, when Thompson got out of federal prison for dealing drugs in 2015, he applied for Social Security disability benefits under the fake name he'd been using for so many years, prosecutors said.\n\nHis fraud began to fall apart when the man whose name Thompson had been using also applied for Social Security benefits in 2016. Still living in Oklahoma, the now-homeless man discovered he wasn't eligible because Thompson was already getting his money.\n\nThe man \u2013 whose name was not made public by prosecutors or in court records \u2013 then spent two years trying to prove his identity to the Social Security administration, homeless the entire time, according to court records.\n\nMeanwhile, Thompson collected thousands of dollars in Social Security benefits, including disability benefits he wasn't eligible for.\n\nThompson's former customer finally began receiving his benefits in May 2018, according to court records, but the Social Security Administration didn't forget about Thompson.\n\nWorking with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Denver, Social Security investigators secured a federal grand jury indictment in July 2018, and Thompson pleaded guilty in November. He was sentenced on Friday to 30 months in federal prison and ordered to pay back more than $900 he received from pretending to be the other man.\n\nHe was also forced to sign the plea deal under his own name, the looping cursive reflecting an older man's hand: James Thompson.\n\n\"We want criminals to know if you commit a crime, particularly against vulnerable people and no matter for how long it goes on, the law will eventually catch up with you and there will be consequences,\" said Jason Dunn, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/20/stolen-identity-lifelong-criminal-used-false-name-30-years/2920870002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2019/02/22/new-election-ordered-disputed-n-c-house-race/2945896002/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/02/19/thwaites-glacier-if-hole-collapses-global-warming-what-happens/2789989002/", "text": "CLOSE A cavity two thirds the size of Manhattan has formed under one of the world\u2019s most dangerous glaciers.

The cavity is big enough to have contained 14 billion tons of ice, with most of it melting over the past three years.\n\nEven before this cavity, Thwaites' rapid ice loss and potential impact on global sea levels were significant enough that researchers from around the world planned to physically travel there starting this year.\n\nOnly 28 people have ever set foot on the glacier, according to Britain's Natural Environmental Research Council, or NERC.\n\nSo what might happen if Thwaites does collapse?\n\nStart the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\n\"It could potentially destabilize the whole region of West Antarctica,\" Lucas Zoet, a University of Wisconsin geoscientist, , told USA TODAY.\n\nThwaites is a 'wildcard' for sea levels\n\nThe glacier sits in West Antarctica and flows into the Amundsen Sea. Roughly the size of Florida, Thwaites' melting is currently responsible for about 4 percent of global sea level rise, according to NASA in its recent study on the glacier's giant hole.\n\nMore: Melting ice from Greenland and Antarctica could cause more extreme weather\n\n\"It's a major throughway of how ice gets discharged from West Antarctica into the ocean,\" said Zoet.\n\nThwaites has been difficult to study because it's far from U.S. bases in the Antarctic and also because the weather is \"particularly bad,\" said Zoet.\n\nThe glacier measures more than 70,000 square miles, making it one of the largest glaciers in the world, said NERC.\n\nA map of where Thwaites is located. (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nThe glacier's grounding line, the point at which ice meets the land underneath, has retreated over 9 miles between 1992 and 2011, according to NERC. As ice and warmer seawater flow underneath the glacier, it lifts off the land and speeds up its retreat.\n\n\"If this cavity grows or sort of expands, that\u2019s one way it can get off this last sort of ridge that Thwaites Glacier is hanging on to,\" Zoet told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat especially worries scientists is if the melting accelerates. If all the ice on Thwaites is lost, it would raise ocean levels an additional 2 feet, according to the NASA study. But the glacier also backstops neighboring glaciers. If those glaciers also melt, sea levels could rise an additional eight feet, researchers warn.\n\nMore: Here are the facts: Despite winter storms, global warming is real\n\n\"It holds a kind of wildcard for being able to increase the rate of sea-level rise quite rapidly if things unfold a certain way,\" said Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\nHow do you visit a location so remote?\n\nScambos said research into Thwaites' retreat started as early as the 1990s, as satellite data got better at tracking Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nScambos is part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), a partnership between British and American scientists that studies the glacier's retreat up close.\n\n\"Satellites show the Thwaites region is changing rapidly, but to answer the key questions of how much, and how quickly sea-level will change in the future, requires scientists on the ground with sophisticated equipment collecting the data we need to measure rates of ice-volume or ice-mass change,\" said William E. Easterling, assistant director for the National Science Foundation\u2019s Directorate for Geosciences, in a statement last year.\n\nMore: Melting glaciers in Arctic reveal land hidden for 40,000 years, study says\n\nDire projections\n\n\"The point is not so much is whether or not it\u2019s going to happen, unless we really change how much heat-trapping gasses we\u2019re putting in the atmosphere,\" said Scambos of the glacier's melting. \"Eventually, we\u2019re going to lose big areas of the Antarctic, big areas in Greenland. The important thing is how fast is this going to happen.\"\n\nMelting from Greenland and Antarctica would not only bump up sea levels but might bring more extreme weather and dramatic shifts in temperature, according to a study published in Nature in February.\n\nScambos said coastal cities in the U.S. and worldwide are looking ahead to how higher sea levels could impact them. If Thwaites' melting happens over centuries, then nations would have more time to get ready.\n\nA faster rise in sea level, however, could force countries to act more urgently.\n\nIf that pace were to double or triple suddenly because glacier melt really picked up, \"then that\u2019s going to really throw a wrench into the ability for these nations to plan and prepare for the impacts of sea level rise,\" Scambos said.\n\nMore: Antarctic ice melting 6 times faster than it did in '80s\n\nMore: Ancient Antarctic ice sheet collapse could happen again, triggering a new global flood\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/02/19/thwaites-glacier-if-hole-collapses-global-warming-what-happens/2789989002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/19/zombie-deer-disease-why-deer-cwd-nothing-like-zombies/2906715002/", "text": "CLOSE CWD is an always-fatal disease that leaves their brains full of holes.

They are very sick.\u201d\n\nWhile the term could give the general public the wrong impression about CWD,\n\nKrysten Schuler, wildlife disease ecologist and co-director at the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, said the disease is \"a big problem\" and she's glad more people are paying attention to it. People just need to be properly informed, she said.\n\nCWD, which is fatal to all deer that contract it, was first identified in the 1960s, and is now in 24 states across the nation. It's a serious infectious disease in animals, but likely won't spark an apocalypse.\n\nHere's why:\n\nMany appear totally normal.\n\nInfected deer could easily die from another cause (killed by a predator or car) before they show CWD symptoms such as drooling, listlessness and low weight, Thomas said. Deer, elk and moose with the disease might appear healthy for up to two years, as neurological symptoms develop slowly, according to the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance. Symptoms usually only show during the last few months before death.\n\n\"You cannot eyeball a deer and say if it has CWD,\" Thomas said, noting that hunters have shot infected animals, believing they are healthy, only to find out through testing that their deer has CWD.\n\nMany deer suffering from chronic wasting disease may appear totally healthy for more than a year. (Photo: Nathan Bilow, AP)\n\nThey probably won't attack.\n\nDeer with CWD aren't going to eat your brains. They actually have holes in their brains that might cause them to be less coordinated and have trouble walking, Thomas said. Deer in the final stage of CWD could also appear weak, and underweight.\n\nWhile hunters should be aware if the disease is prominent in their area, there's no need to fear \"zombie\" deer and avoid hunting, Schuler said. If anything, people who spot a sickly deer should call local wildlife officials so that the deer can be tested, she said.\n\nMore: 'Zombie' deer disease is in 24 states and thousands of infected deer are eaten each year, expert warns\n\nNone have infected humans.\n\nThere have never been any reported cases of CWD in humans. But, studies have shown it can be transmitted to animals other than deer, moose and elk, according to the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told USA TODAY that it's possible humans could contract the disease in the future. So, it is important to take precautions in infected areas. The most likely way humans could become infected is if they eat infected deer meat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Here are a few ways people can avoid CWD.\n\nMore: CWD: What is it, and could it affect humans?\n\nMore: 'Zombie' deer disease: How to prevent it and avoid eating infected meat\n\nFollow Ashley May on Twitter: @AshleyMayTweets\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/19/zombie-deer-disease-why-deer-cwd-nothing-like-zombies/2906715002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2019/02/21/striking-oakland-teachers-rally,-march-downtown/39094587/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/03/26/lottery-jackpot-scam-eddie-tipton-iowa-secret-code/457818002/", "text": "CLOSE Get an overview of how Eddie Tipton created one of the largest lottery scams in history. Wochit\n\nEddie Tipton arrives in the courtroom Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2017, for his sentencing hearing at the Polk County Courthouse in Des Moines. (Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)\n\nThis story is from March 2018\n\n12-15-18-29-38-41.\n\nEddie Tipton jotted down the numbers on a yellow sticky note as he sat at his desk in Urbandale, Iowa more than a decade ago.\n\nAround him were more sticky notes filled with number sets that he carefully wrote down as they spun up on his computer screen. The numbers were generated by a cryptic two-line software code Tipton had planted in his employer\u2019s computer system at the Multi-State Lottery Association.\n\nThe office building was virtually empty as Tipton ran test after test, zeroing in on the possible winning numbers for an upcoming $4.8 million lottery jackpot drawing in Colorado.\n\nHis code would let him narrow the drawing\u2019s winning odds from 5 million to 1 to 200 to 1.\n\nAnd, over time, it would allow him to hijack at least five winning drawings totaling more than $24 million in prizes in Colorado, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma \u2014 the biggest lottery scam in U.S. history.\n\nThe largest jackpot, a $16.5 million Hot Lotto prize in Iowa in 2010, was never paid. And ultimately, it would be the one that would do Tipton in.\n\nThe seed that started it all\n\nEddie Tipton, the cyber security expert and brainpower behind a lottery rigging scandal that netted $2 million in illegal winnings from five state lotteries, pleaded guilty Thursday, June 29, 2017, to a felony charge of ongoing criminal conduct charge at the Polk County Courthouse. (Photo: Rodney White/The Register)\n\nTipton, who loved playing the fantasy game \u201cDungeons and Dragons,\u201d told himself he wasn\u2019t trying to crack the code for the money.\n\nInstead, the Texas native described by his brother as \u201ca very large\u201d and \u201ckind of lonesome\u201d man, was inspired by the challenge.\n\nAn offhand conversation with a co-worker, Gene Schaller, in 2005 set the challenge in motion, Tipton told investigators.\n\n\u201cHey, did you put your secret numbers in there?\u201d Schaller asked him.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tipton replied.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, you can set numbers on any given day, since you wrote the software.\u201d\n\nSchaller, who remains an accountant for the Multi-State Lottery Association, wouldn't comment for this article.\n\nThat night in 2005, the 41-year-old bachelor began a fraud that even he had no idea would eventually shake the lottery industry to its core.\n\n\"It was never my intent to start a full-out ticket scam,\u201d Eddie told investigators during his June 29 post-conviction confession sessions in the Hoover State Office Building in Des Moines.\n\nA criminal past and a job offer\n\nTo be truthful, Tipton never expected he\u2019d land an interview with the Multi-State Lottery Association, let alone be hired and eventually become one of the most entrusted lottery security officials in the nation.\n\nThe association is owned and operated by 36 member lotteries, mostly state organizations such as the Iowa Lottery. It's responsible for many of the nation's most popular and richest lotteries, including Powerball and Hot Lotto.\n\nTipton had pleaded guilty in 1982 for his part in a warehouse burglary. The then 19-year-old faced up to 20 years in prison for the felony conviction, but instead was given two years of probation and was ordered to pay $1,719 in restitution, court records show.\n\nAnd before his burglary conviction, Tipton had been convicted of stealing computer software from a department store. Tipton told federal investigators more than 20 years later that the software theft was a \u201cJerry Springer-style\u201d incident that was \u201cmore of an argument with a Sears employee.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, as he sat for an interview, Tipton told Ed Stefan, his prospective boss at the Multi-State Lottery Association, about both convictions. So he was surprised when the association paid to fly him from Texas to Des Moines for an in-person job interview.\n\nWhy lottery association executives overlooked Tipton\u2019s criminal convictions isn't entirely clear. MUSL knew about the burglary when Tipton was hired, according to court documents.\n\nState law prohibits felons working for the Iowa Lottery. But that law does not apply to MUSL employees.\n\nBret Tyone, CEO of the Multi-State Lottery Association, said he couldn't comment or provide a copy of the association's employee code of conduct, citing ongoing litigation. Stefan did not return calls for comment.\n\nBut former deputy Iowa Attorney General Thomas H. Miller made it clear in an interview this year that he believes Tipton should never have been given the opportunity to land a job where he would design the software that randomly picked the winning numbers for the Multi-State Lottery Association.\n\n\"A thief is a thief,\u201d Miller told Game Show Network.\n\nA Bigfoot hunt, a lottery win and a duped FBI\n\nTipton\u2019s initial late-night sticky note session resulted in his scam\u2019s first win \u2014 a Nov. 23, 2005, drawing in Colorado.\n\nThe stars aligned for that game: It was a major jackpot \u2014 $4.8 million \u2014 and it landed on one of the three dates during the year that he was able to manipulate with his secret code.\n\nThe opportunity was especially convenient because of his brother\u2019s hunt for Bigfoot.\n\nTommy Tipton\u2019s fascination with folklore surrounding the ape-like creature began as a child, when his grandmother retold stories about a critter that would spook their farm animals in Arkansas.\n\nAnd it just so happened that Tommy\u2019s pursuit of Bigfoot was taking him to Colorado in November 2005.\n\nEddie, who said few people possessed the \"geekiness\" necessary to understand his work, seized the opportunity to try out his rigged coding.\n\n\u201cMy brother was going on a trip, and I suggested that I had some numbers that he could play,\" he told investigators. \"And that was pretty much it.\"\n\nBut the story, according to his brother, was far more nuanced.\n\nTommy, who by 2005 was a magistrate in Fayette County, Texas, was skeptical whether it was legal for him to play the hundreds of sets of numbers given him by his brother, an employee of the lottery association.\n\nTommy told investigators he contacted a friend, Texas defense attorney Luis Vallejo, to consult about the matter. Vallejo could find no reason that it would be illegal for him to play, even though Eddie worked for the lottery association, Tommy said.\n\nAfter the winning numbers were drawn Nov. 23, 2005, three people came forward to claim the $4.8 million prize: a Colorado resident not linked to the conspiracy; Alexander Hicks, a friend of Tommy\u2019s whom he had recruited to cash the ticket; and Texas lawyer Thad Whisenant, who had created a Nevada limited liability-corporation called Cuestion de Suerte (Question of Luck).\n\nThe Colorado resident\u2019s claim came from an \u201ceasy pick\u201d ticket, meaning the numbers were selected by a machine. Investigators ruled that purchase legitimate.\n\nBut the others drew their suspicion. Whisenant and Vallejo were publicly named by investigators, who in August 2016 asked the public for assistance in the case.\n\nThey were never arrested.\n\nWhom can you trust?\n\nTommy told investigators during his June 29, 2017, deposition that he believed Vallejo somehow stole the numbers he had been given by his brother, although Tommy said he never directly confronted him about it.\n\nHicks \u2014 who was never charged with a crime \u2014 gave 90% of the nearly $570,000 cash-option prize payout from the jackpot to Tommy. Cuestion de Suerte collected the same amount.\n\nNeither Vallejo nor Whisenant returned calls for this article. Whisenant was never asked to return the money he collected.\n\nTommy remains bitter about the outcome.\n\n\u201cIt was a big shock to me to hear that an attorney whom I went to for advice played the lottery,\" he said of Vallejo.\n\nSoon after the 2005 win, Tommy fell from a 31-foot tree stand while Bigfoot hunting and \u201calmost died,\u201d he told investigators. He was in the hospital in 2006 when the FBI questioned him about why he was trying to exchange $450,000 in consecutively marked bills.\n\nTommy truthfully told the agents the money came from the 2005 Colorado lottery win. But he told them he was trying to exchange the bills because he couldn\u2019t tell his wife of the win since gambling was contrary to her Christian faith.\n\nIn neither the first nor a subsequent interview did the FBI ask about the work his brother was doing for the Multi-State Lottery Association \u2014 and Tommy never volunteered the information.\n\nEventually, the FBI dropped its inquiry, and the Tiptons resumed their lottery scheme.\n\nFrustrated Eddie warns his bosses\n\nAs the head of the Multi-State Lottery Association's IT security, Eddie Tipton was making almost $100,000 a year. But he felt underappreciated and overworked at the time he wrote the code to hack into the national lottery system.\n\nHe was working 50- to 60-hour weeks and often was in the office until 11 p.m. His managers expected him to take on far more roles than were practical, he complained.\n\n\"I wrote software. I worked on Web pages. I did network security. I did firewalls,\" he said in his confession. \"And then I did my regular auditing job on top of all that. They just found no limits to what they wanted to make me do. It even got to the point where the word \u2018slave\u2019 was used.\"\n\nNobody at the Multi-State Lottery Association oversaw his complete body of work, and few people truly cared about security, he said. That lack of oversight allowed Tipton to write, install and use his secret code without discovery.\n\nTipton said he even warned lottery officials about the system's security risks and alerted them in 2006 about an error in the random-drawing software after the same numbers were drawn in the same order in the same year in a Wisconsin game.\n\nSoon after his first successful lottery scam, Eddie said he offered a fix that would have thwarted his ability to predict winning numbers \u2014 appointing a second person to oversee some of the most crucial processes of the random-generator software.\n\nHis immediate boss, Stefan, took the concerns seriously, he said, but others in the organization did not. Most of his concerns were dismissed or inadequately addressed, Tipton complained.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d do reviews and I\u2019d find stuff \u2014 gaping holes in their procedures \u2014 and I would tell them, but if it wasn't in my rules, the MUSL rules, I couldn\u2019t write it down,\" he said. \"I couldn\u2019t document that I saw this gaping hole because they didn\u2019t want to hear it or they didn\u2019t want it written down anywhere.\u201d\n\nAnd so the secret code survived.\n\nThat code was replicated on as many as 17 state lottery systems as MUSL integrated the random-number software Tipton designed. For nearly a decade, it allowed Tipton to rig the drawings for games played on three dates each year: May 27, Nov. 23 and Dec. 29.\n\nTipton's software version is no longer used.\n\nThe big mistake\n\nIt was on Dec. 23, 2010, that Eddie made a miscalculation that ultimately unraveled his scheme: He bought a winning ticket himself.\n\nBefore, he had always funneled winning numbers to others.\n\nVideo captured his ticket purchase at a Des Moines convenience store about 10 miles from the Multi-State Lottery Association offices.\n\nRobert Rhodes pleaded guilty Monday Jan. 9, 2017, to an Iowa fraud charge admitting his role in a now-infamous attempt to cash in on a winning Hot Lotto ticket worth more than $14 million, at the Polk County Courthouse in Des Moines, Iowa. Eddie Tipton, a former information security director for the Multi-State Lottery Association, has already been convicted of two fraud charges for allegedly tampering with computers to rig the outcome of the Dec. 29, 2010, drawing. (Photo: Rodney White/The Register)\n\nThough he knew the Iowa Lottery had retained a video of the purchase, Eddie told one of his best friends, Robert Rhodes, that he could claim the ticket if he wanted.\n\nBut Eddie gave Rhodes one caveat: Don\u2019t wait until the last minute to claim the ticket.\n\nThat advice was ignored.\n\nRhodes participated in an intricate plan to claim the prize anonymously \u2014 less than two hours before the 4 p.m. deadline on Dec. 29, 2011.\n\nThe 11th-hour scheme to claim the ticket captivated the public's attention. The $16.5 million jackpot was the third-largest prize in Hot Lotto's history.\n\nFor weeks, lottery officials had peppered news media across the country to publicize the unclaimed ticket. Then, just as the year-long window was to expire, two attorneys representing a trust showed up at Iowa Lottery headquarters to claim the prize.\n\nBut Iowa law requires Iottery winners' names and addresses to be made public, and the mystery over who was behind the claim dominated newscasts for weeks.\n\nDespite the intense scrutiny, it would take investigators roughly three years to connect Tipton to the Hot Lotto rigging. On Jan. 15, 2015, he was charged with two counts of felony fraud.\n\nHe later faced other charges, mostly related to money laundering and fraudulent wins in other states.\n\nHis brother Tommy and Rhodes also were charged with felonies related to the rigged drawings.\n\nRhodes, of Sugar Land, Texas, pleaded guilty to a felony charge of being party to a computer crime and was sentenced in March 2017 to six months of home confinement in Texas and ordered to pay $409,000 in restitution.\n\nHe agreed to testify against Eddie and Tommy Tipton as part of his plea deal.\n\nTommy and Eddie pleaded guilty to felony crimes related to the rigging scheme in June 2017 and agreed to repay $2.2 million in restitution.\n\nTommy admitted claiming prizes in Colorado and Oklahoma using numbers Eddie provided. He was sentenced to 75 days in jail.\n\nEddie was sentenced in August to up to 25 years in prison.\n\nEddie, 54, did not respond to a request to speak for this article. He is serving his sentence in Iowa's Clarinda Correctional Facility.\n\nIt's uncertain how many years Eddie will spend in prison. He could be paroled within three or four years, his attorneys noted at his sentencing last year.\n\nHe has paid $25,000 of his $16.8 million in restitution, according to the most recent court records filed in January.\n\nMore from the USA TODAY Network on this story:\n\nMore: They cheated the Iowa Lottery but got to keep the money\n\nMore: Some Iowa Lottery retail employees win big, raising suspicions\n\nMore: Iowa Lottery takes a pass on fixes to stop cheaters.

In your rush to get your taxes done, don\u2019t make these six mistakes. Josmar Taveras, USA TODAY\n\nMore than 150 million tax returns are expected to be filed to the Internal Revenue Service this year. It\u2019s likely some may have errors. Don't let it be you.\n\nEvery year, tax professionals usually see the same common errors, with varying consequences.\n\nThis year is extra thorny because taxpayers also face a new filing landscape after the tax law introduced major changes. Among them are the increased standard deductions, the doubling of the child tax credit and the capping of state and local tax deduction.\n\nThese changes could make it easier to get tripped up. So, it pays read up on the new tax law, take it slow and review your return before filing.\n\nHere are 10 mistakes to avoid:\n\n1. Don\u2019t miss this new credit\n\nTax pros worry that Americans may miss the new credit for dependents introduced by the tax law. The nonrefundable tax credit is worth up to $500 for each qualifying person and begins to phase out at $200,000 in adjusted gross income ($400,000 for joint filers).\n\nDon't be surprised: New tax deduction cap could turn big refund into big tax bill\n\nTools for taxes: Intimidated by taxes? These online tools can help you navigate your federal returns\n\nA dependent can be a child who is 17 or older, a relative, or a nonrelative who lived with you for the entire year. The non-child dependent must have made less than $4,150 in gross income last year, while you provided more than half of the person\u2019s financial support.\n\nEvery year, tax professionals usually see the same common errors, with varying consequences. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n2. Not filing a return\n\nSome Americans aren\u2019t required to file a federal tax return because they don\u2019t earn enough in income. Those income thresholds vary depending on status and age. But even if you don\u2019t need to file a tax return because of low income, do it anyway, says Kathy Pickering, executive director of H&R Block\u2019s Tax Institute.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s roughly $1 billion in unclaimed refunds from people not filing a return.\u201d Kathy Pickering, executive director of H&R Block's Tax Institute\n\n\u201cYou may be eligible to claim a refundable credit or you may have a refund owed to you,\u201d Pickering says. \u201cThere\u2019s roughly $1 billion in unclaimed refunds from people not filing a return.\u201d\n\nIf you lost your job and claimed unemployment benefits, you also need to file a return, she says. That\u2019s because some people don\u2019t request for taxes to be withheld from their unemployment checks and end up owing the government. \u201cThat can get people in trouble,\u201d she says.\n\n3. Picking the wrong filing status\n\nAttention single parents: You may want to choose the head of household filing status, rather than single status. Head of household comes with a larger standard deduction and often a lower tax rate. To qualify, you must:\n\nBe unmarried on the last day of the tax year\n\nContribute more than half of the financial support of your home\n\nHave your children live with you for more than six months of the year\n\nFor couples who are separated or going through a divorce, it\u2019s usually better to file as married filing jointly than married filing separately, Pickering says.\n\n\u201cI know it can be difficult to work with a separated spouse to file taxes, but choosing married filing separately is unfortunately, the most punitive filing status,\u201d she says. That\u2019s because the status disqualifies you from certain credits and deductions.\n\nIf you want to change your status after you file your taxes, you must file an amended paper return.\n\n4. Filing without all documents\n\nMake sure you have all your W-2s from every employer, 1099 forms that show other income and other documents to claim certain credits or deductions, such as a tuition statement for the American Opportunity Credit, which is for expenses from the first four years of higher education up to $2,500 per student. If you rush to file your taxes and forget a document, you will need to file an amended return.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

Forgetting big life events\n\nThink about your life\u2019s highs or lows last year, such as getting married or divorced, having a baby or becoming widowed, receiving a promotion or losing your job. All these can affect your taxes. They can move you to a higher or lower tax bracket, change your filing status, or qualify or disqualify you for new credits or deductions.\n\nMore than 150 million tax returns are expected to be filed to the Internal Revenue Service this year. It\u2019s likely some may have errors. Don't let it be you. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nFor instance, if you got a raise or your spouse went back to work, the added income could affect how much you can claim of the American Opportunity Credit, which begins to phase out at $160,000 for joint filers and is unavailable to couples who earn $180,000 or more.\n\nJ.C. Penney switch:Store discontinues sales of appliances, furniture as potential store closures loom\n\n6. Entering incorrect info\n\nA typo can cause a lot of headaches. In some cases, the IRS will reject an electronic tax return right after it\u2019s submitted if a Social Security number or misspelled name doesn\u2019t match its records. You can easily correct the information and resubmit.\n\nBut if you enter the wrong bank account number for your direct deposit, the IRS won\u2019t know until the deposit is rejected by your bank. In that case, the IRS will send a paper check, but it will be six to eight weeks later, Jaeger says.\n\nEconomy at risk? Will Trump administration tax cuts, spending hikes blow up deficit and doom economy?\n\nSimilarly, if you enter the wrong income amount \u2013 say you forget a zero \u2013 you won\u2019t be able to correct it until you hear back from the IRS, which doesn\u2019t receive your income information from your employer until March.\n\n7. Missing Earned Income Tax Credit\n\nEvery year, almost a quarter of taxpayers miss out on this valuable credit worth up to $6,431 in 2018. It\u2019s forgotten so much that the IRS has dedicated an awareness day for the credit.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge credit for low and middle-class taxpayers,\u201d says Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant and tax expert at TurboTax. \u201cPeople usually think they make too much money to qualify.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a huge credit for low and middle-class taxpayers. People usually think they make too much money to qualify.\u201d Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant and tax expert at TurboTax\n\nBut changes in life circumstances \u2013 such as a job loss or a spouse staying home with a newborn \u2013 may be enough to make you eligible for the credit this year.\n\n8. Paying someone to do your taxes\n\nForget the tax accountant if you have an easy tax return. You probably have a simple one if you:\n\nTake the standard deduction\n\nReceive a W-2 statement rather than 1099 form for your income\n\nClaim the Earned Income Tax Credit or child tax credits\n\nHave limited interest and dividend income\n\nMost major tax preparation software, such as TurboTax and H&R Block, offer a free-file service.\n\n9. Not claiming a child\n\nWho gets to claim the child? The correct answer can become complicated if someone other than the child\u2019s parents is supporting the child.\n\nFor instance, a single grandparent whose grandchild lives with them may be able to claim head of household status and claim a child tax credit. In some cases, the grandparent may also qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\n10. Missing the other education credit\n\nMany taxpayers may be familiar with the American Opportunity Credit for higher education expenses. But there\u2019s another credit for other educational expenses. It\u2019s the Lifetime Learning Credit, and it\u2019s worth up to $2,000 per tax return.\n\n\u201cThat one can cover expenses even if you\u2019re not in a four-year degree program, such as training for a job certification,\u201d Pickering says.\n\nCLOSE Taxpayers are accustomed to receiving big refunds after filing, but experts warn that with new laws more people could end up owing the IRS.

(Photo: University of the Witwatersrand)\n\nThe clue to the discovery was finding an ancient mineral on Mauritius that shouldn't have been there.\n\nBy studying the mineral zircon, which is found in rocks spewed up by lava during volcanic eruptions, Ashwal and his colleagues discovered remnants of this mineral that were much too old to belong on the island of Mauritius.\n\n\u201cEarth is made up of two parts \u2014 continents, which are old, and oceans, which are 'young,'\" he said. On continents, rocks can be billions of years old, but nothing that old exists in the oceans, explained Ashwal.\n\nMauritius is only a few million years old, while some recently discovered zircon crystals on the island were estimated at 3 billion years old. \u201cThe fact that we have found zircons of this age proves that there are much older crustal materials under Mauritius that could only have originated from a continent,\u201d says Ashwal.\n\nThe study said there are likely many pieces of various sizes of \u201cundiscovered continent, collectively called Mauritia,\" spread over the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe study appeared in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Communications.\n\nProf. Lewis D.

(Photo: Thinkstock)\n\nThis story was published in 2017\n\nReal life can be busy. And with hyper-sexual images and storylines dominating shows and movies, couples often ask: Should we be having more sex?\n\nThough people are quick to compare themselves against others, there is no magic number when it comes to how often you should have sex with your partner, according to Mary Andres, a professor at the University of Southern California, and co-coordinator of marriage and family therapy program.\n\nHere are a few things sex therapists say to think about next time you're questioning your sex life:\n\nHow much sex should a couple have?\n\nA 40-year study that surveyed more than 30,000 Americans, found in 2015 that couples who have sex once a week are the happiest. So, should couples put a number on how often they hop in the bed?\n\nAndres said couples need to understand how often each person needs to have sex to be fulfilled in the relationship.\n\n\u201cSome people want to have sex every day, and they are,\u201d she said. \u201cOther people have other priorities, so sex isn\u2019t on the top of their list, so they are having it less.\u201d\n\nThe primary problem for many couples is not the frequency of sex, but how they talk about it, according to Heidi Crockett, a licensed psychotherapist in Florida and an (AASECT) American Association of Sexuality educators, counselors and therapists, certified sex therapist.\n\n\"If both people in the couple have a general desire to want to please their partner and participate in the relationship and talk about things openly, usually something can be negotiated that can satisfy both people,\" Crockett said.\n\nIs your hyper-plugged-in life hurting your sex life?\n\nToday couples have an onslaught of distractions keeping them from having sex, Andres said.\n\n\u201cA lot more people are connected to devices\u2014 if they are watching videos, TV in the bedroom, texting or updating Twitter feeds, it's detrimental to their sex lives,\u201d Andres said.\n\nShe compares refreshing a Twitter or Facebook feed to gambling.\n\n\u201cThat immediate gratification can be more compelling than let\u2019s take the time to get in the bed and have sex,\u201d she said. \u201cSex may have longer gratification and might have a bigger payoff, but people are going for fast and easy.\u201d\n\nShe said people can reclaim their bedroom and use it not to update Twitter, but to spend time with their partner.\n\nToo tired for sex? Join the club.\n\nParticularly for couples with children or stressful jobs, sometimes the idea of having sex is too much to bear, but having sex can have positive effects on your life.\n\nAndres said sex does several things for people:\n\n1. Sex releases endorphins that make you feel good and increase the feeling of closeness with your partner.\n\n2. Sex can clear the mind. Andes said if you have a \u201cnoisy brain,\u201d sex reallocates your blood flow to your genitals and can help clear your thoughts.\n\nBut while sex intellectually makes sense, when you\u2019re really tired it\u2019s hard to follow through, she said. If one person is exhausted, couples should have a conversation about it.\n\n\u201c'Lets make this work, don\u2019t want to put this on you when you are already depleted and think I am being selfish, but I also want to have the opportunity to connect with you \u2013 and remind ourselves why we are doing this,\u2019\u201d Andres said.\n\nIf a partner wants to discuss issues within the relationship or the frequency of sex, it's important to carefully plan how they address the subject, according to Crockett.\n\n\"You say, 'I am interested in talking more about our sex life but I would like to set up a time so make an appointment for it,'\" she said. \"There are introverts and extroverts, so some like to process out loud and some like to have information ahead of time and think about it before they come to the table.\"\n\nConversations about sex can be awkward, so it's important to be aware of your partners needs, she said.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have physical intercourse to satisfy your partner\n\nAndres said couples can figure out what works for them when it comes to satisfying their partner\u2019s needs.\n\nIf one partner wants to have sex three times a week, and the other doesn\u2019t, other sex acts can act as a substitute for actual intercourse.\n\n\u201cYou can expand what the idea of that definition is, so you find something that is mutually beneficial to both,\u201d she said.\n\nSchedule sex like you would any other activity, and show up\n\nWhile the idea of romantic, spontaneous sex may be what many picture, it\u2019s hard to find time for sex when people are consistently hard-pressed for time.\n\n\u201cWe have to schedule sex like everything else,\u201d Andres said. \u201cIf you are scheduling going to a class, you show up turn off your phone, leave it in your car\u2026 People have to prioritize their sex lives the way they prioritize other things.\u201d\n\nAndes said many people think a weekly date night will amp up romance, but many times couples end up in a \u201cfood coma\u201d and don\u2019t have sex afterward.\n\n\u201cHave the babysitter take the kids out, have sex and then go out to dinner,\u201d Andres said. \u201cIt works.\u201d\n\nWhen is it time to see a counselor?\n\nAndres said people should seek help if they feel rejected or like their partner is not listening to their needs sexually.\n\nShe said many couples might try to learn how to be more open with their partner about their needs by reading a book or watching a video on connecting.\n\nCrockett said sex therapy or counseling can be beneficial for couples who want to rebuild their sex lives and those who are already satisfied.\n\n\"Even couples that are happy with their sex life could see a therapist, because they will ask questions the couple may not have discussed or ideas they might not have known,\" she said. Going to a therapist is an opportunity to learn more about yourself and your sex life.\"\n\nFollow Mary Bowerman on Twitter: @MaryBowerman\n\nCLOSE Sex can help improve your physical and mental wellbeing.

But what if they could identify kids at risk? Researchers are trying to develop phone apps to detect impending mental health crises. (Jan. 3) AP\n\nAs teen depression in the United States has risen in the past decade, most boys and girls are seeing mental health as a major problem, according to a new survey from Pew Research Center.\n\nIn a survey of nearly 1,000 teens ages 13 to 17, 70 percent say anxiety and depression are critical issues among their peers, Pew found.\n\nWhile there isn't data to compare this trend to past generations, Juliana Menasce Horowitz, Pew's associate director of research, told USA TODAY this finding was still \"most striking\" given how it compared to other concerns teens said were major problems.\n\nJust 55 percent said bullying was a major problem, 51 percent said drug addiction and 45 percent said drinking alcohol.\n\nMoreover, concern around anxiety and depression rang true across gender, racial and economic divisions within the surveyed group.\n\nMore: If you've ever had suicidal thoughts, make a safety plan\n\nDepression among teens has been on the rise in recent years, a 2016 study in the medical journal Pediatrics concluded. Researchers found that from 2005 to 2014, major depressive episodes increased in children ages 12 to 17 from 8.7 percent to 11.3 percent.\n\nSo, what's driving teens' concerns about mental health? While Horowitz noted Pew asked about the issues teens saw among their peers \u2013 not their own experiences with depression or anxiety \u2013 and didn't tie the concerns around mental health to any one cause, the research center's data does show the pressure to get good grades affects more than others.\n\nSixty-one percent of teens said they felt a lot of pressure to get good grades whereas only 29 percent said they felt a lot of pressure to look good and 28 percent felt a lot of pressure to fit in socially. Not even 10 percent felt a lot of pressure either to be sexually active, use drugs or drink alcohol.\n\nAdditionally, over half of teens say they're planning to go to a four-year college, with girls (68 percent) more likely than boys (51 percent) to say so.\n\nIn December, Sonia Livingstone, a social psychologist at the London School of Economics and Political Science, told USA TODAY several factors could be contributing to rising depression. Perhaps the biggest, she said, is that it's more socially acceptable for kids to talk openly about mental health.\n\nMore: Depression in adolescents and young adults is rising: Are phones and social media to blame?\n\n\"What we have today is a greater degree of visibility,\" Livingstone said. \"It very easily looks like an epidemic in mental health problems, but 10, 15 years ago, these were shameful things that nobody mentioned.\"\n\nShe said teens and young adults face more pressure to achieve in school and in extracurricular activities.\n\n\"It is becoming a more competitive world, and they have to play their part,\" Livingstone said. \"It brings competition much earlier. So it is kind of an undermining of childhood.\"\n\nIn a separate analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data published Wednesday, Pew researchers also found teens today are spending much more time doing homework and less time socializing, compared to past generations.\n\n\"Overall, teens (ages 15 to 17) spend an hour a day, on average, doing homework during the school year, up from 44 minutes a day about a decade ago and 30 minutes in the mid-1990s,\" Pew's Gretchen Livingston wrote.\n\nOn the flip side, time spent socializing fell by 16 minutes per day compared to a decade ago, Pew's analysis found.\n\nYet amid their concerns about mental health and pressures from school, teens said in the Pew survey that their long-term goals are centered around enjoying their careers more so than making money.\n\nA whopping 95 percent said having a job or career they enjoy is important to them, compared to just 51 percent saying having a lot of money is. The trend stayed mostly consistent regardless of teens' household income.\n\n\"(Enjoying their work) is more important to teens as they look ahead to their lives as grown ups,\" Horowitz said.\n\nSuicide Lifeline: If you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time of day or night or chat online.\n\nCrisis Text Line provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in crisis when they dial 741741.\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/21/depression-anxiety-seen-major-problem-among-teens-pew-survey-says/2940998002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/weather/2019/02/22/hail-storm-hit-los-angeles-amid-cold-blast/2945103002/", "text": ""}, {"source": "usa", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/11/21/clean-beauty-truth-talc-parabens-makeup-ingredients/1897128002/", "text": "CLOSE Despite the growing popularity of \u201cclean\u201d beauty products, industry veterans say terms like \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d are unregulated and often meaningless. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nConsumer confusion around cosmetic ingredients has grown in recent years as the clean beauty movement gains momentum. (Photo: Colorblind, Getty Images)\n\nSkincare sets wrapped in millennial pink and eco-green fill Instagram ads this season. With their pore-refining promises, these would-be stocking-stuffers draw attention to \u201ctoxic chemicals\" canceled by clean-living proponents in the past few years.\n\nFace masks with parabens? Don\u2019t even think about it, the gospel of Goop preaches. Body lotions with mineral oils? Definitely not on Beautycounter\u2019s \u201cnice\u201d list.\n\nBut trying to understand the rationale behind these decrees can be more complicated than applying liquid eyeliner in an airplane bathroom.\n\nExperts and industry veterans say the muddy reality of the billion-dollar clean beauty movement \u2013 which drove a 27 percent increase in skincare alone this year \u2013 is that terms such as \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d are essentially meaningless and unregulated, and the much-hyped health risks of several chemical ingredients are based on questionable data.\n\n\u201cThere is kind of a chemophobia in the U.S. \u2013 if it's a chemical, a man-made chemical, it must be bad,\" said Curtis Klaassen, former president of the Society of Toxicology and chair of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics at the Kansas University Medical Center.\n\nMore: The truth about talc, parabens and 8 other controversial makeup ingredients\n\nMore: 6 dubious clean beauty claims from Goop and Beautycounter, decoded\n\nThe Environmental Working Group (EWG), a nonprofit advocacy organization that\u2019s a leader of the clean cosmetics crusade, says that even if it\u2019s impossible to directly prove these ingredients cause cancer, people should believe the most pilloried chemicals are bad for you based on reviews of research.\n\nNneka Leiba, EWG's director of healthy living science, argues that outside of smoking, there is rarely \"definitive proof\" that a chemical causes cancer, but there is an overall burden on the body from chemicals in personal care products. Some of these chemicals are also present in the environment, but at least with cosmetics, \"you have the choice not to buy that product,\" she said.\n\nThat sensibility confounds those who say the adage \u201cthe dose makes the poison\u201d is one of the basic principles of toxicology. Klaassen compares it to the wind: Gusts of a few miles per hour are harmless, yet those reaching 100 mph can topple a house.\n\n\"The average person wants a yes/no for every chemical, and they don\u2019t think about the dose,\" Klaassen said. \"It turns out that 50 percent of the chemicals in the world we think are carcinogens if you're given enough.\"\n\nThe need for more regulation\n\nThe back and forth on ingredient safety has been enabled in part by the relative low levels of U.S. regulation on the cosmetics industry \u2013 something many industry veterans and activists alike deem problematic.\n\nFor Nicolette Leung, 32, who primarily buys natural products after starting a clean-living transition a few years ago, the difference between the more rigorous regulations of countries such as the European Union and those in the USA gave her pause. Leung says she's privileged to be able to make natural products a priority, though she says it hasn't necessarily made navigating beauty aisles any easier.\n\n\"Even with natural beauty products it's confusing,\" Leung said. \"I think the entire industry is confusing and opaque.\"\n\n\u201cThe truth is that there are no regulations around the term \u2018clean beauty,\u2019 \u201d said Paula Begoun, who launched cult-favorite beauty line Paula\u2019s Choice in 1995. \u201cIt typically means minimal to no synthetic ingredients and the absence of any ingredient deemed controversial, even if there\u2019s valid research attesting to the ingredient\u2019s safety as used in cosmetics.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees cosmetics, which legally must be safe for consumers to use as directed and properly labeled.

Certain ingredients are banned \u2013 lead acetate, which is found in some men's hair dyes, was added to that list late last month. The FDA has long tracked reports on exposure and \"adverse event\" complaints on products, says Linda Katz, director of FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors.\n\n\"Most chemicals that have been used in cosmetics have a long history of safe use and have not been the subject of major concern,\" she said.\n\nThe cosmetics industry, through the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), sought to assuage consumers' concerns by creating the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) committee in 1976 in coordination with the FDA. The independent panel of scientists issues reports on safety risks, which are taken into consideration by the FDA and the industry. (Klaassen is a member of CIR.)\n\nCritics say that self-policing method is not enough. EWG and Breast Cancer Prevention Partners (BCPP) run websites with their own determinations on safety. EWG was among the groups petitioning the FDA to ban lead acetate.\n\nThe Goop effect\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop, Jessica Alba\u2019s Honest Company and Beautycounter have made highly publicized movements away from synthetic ingredients to natural alternatives, touting never-use lists of a thousand or more. The strategy has backfired in some high-profile cases. Alba's natural sunscreen was widely panned because it didn't protect skin from burning and led to lawsuits, and her baby wipes and baby powder were recalled last year because of mold and contamination of microorganisms, respectively. Beautycounter recalled its Nourishing Day Cream because of bacteria last year.\n\nActress and Honest Company co-founder Jessica Alba (Photo: Mat Hayward, Getty Images for Nordstrom)\n\nMore: Jessica Alba\u2019s Honest Co. recalls organic baby powder\n\nMore: 10 mildly pretentious commandments from \u2018beauty bible\u2019 \u2018Goop Clean Beauty\u2019\n\nGoop and Beautycounter say they err on the side of caution with their products.\n\n\"We believe that you can make beautiful, efficacious products without customers needing to worry about unsafe levels of toxins in their products,\" said Susan Beck, Goop's senior vice president of science and research.\n\nLindsay Dahl, vice president of Social and Environmental Responsibility at Beautycounter, argues the demand for hard evidence of cancer or hormone disruption is misguided.\n\n\"If there\u2019s opportunity for us to prevent exposure to some of these ingredients we should do everything we can to do so,\" Dahl says.\n\nMuch of the focus of clean beauty proponents such as Beautycounter has been on preservatives, namely parabens, a family of chemicals used to prevent the growth of mold or bacteria, and formaldehyde-releasers, a type of preservative that slowly releases a small amount of formaldehyde in products to kill or prevent the growth of bacteria and microorganisms.\n\nLinda Loretz, PCPC\u2019s chief toxicologist, says preservatives have an important safety function that\u2019s gotten lost in the discussion. Contamination is a frequent cause of recalls, she says.\n\n\u201cWithout them you would either be keeping products in the refrigerator or rebuying them all the time because you\u2019d be constantly throwing out contaminated products,\u201d Loretz said.\n\nThe FDA says there\u2019s no evidence of human harm from parabens in cosmetics, and CIR has repeatedly found formaldehyde-releasing preservatives to be safe in the very low percentages found in cosmetics. Yet almost all are on \"baddies\" lists, in industry parlance.\n\nJay Ansell, a chemist and board-certified toxicologist who serves as vice president of cosmetic programs at PCPC, says this discrepancy often results from organizations taking data developed for one application \u2013 such as morticians' use of formaldehyde \u2013 and applying it across the board.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really relevant in our opinion to a formaldehyde-releaser, which may result in a few parts per billion in a product, as opposed to an occupational exposure in high concentrations every day for a lifetime,\u201d Ansell said.\n\nConnie Engel, manager of science translation for BCPP, says it should all be taken into account when \u201cmaking a best guess of what is true but also what is potentially protective of people\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nFor consumers such as Leung, shopping decisions are more about peace of mind than a frenetic fear of disease.\n\n\"I kind of look at it as a similar analogy to cooking,\" Leung says. \"Maybe preservatives aren\u2019t going to kill you, but if I can know what all the ingredients are then that just makes me feel more secure.\"\n\nMore: 4 million Americans could be drinking toxic water and would never know\n\nMore: Retailer Claire's pulls makeup from its shelves over asbestos concerns\n\nDriving change: Women of color\n\nThere's industry-wide consensus on the potential harm of some ingredients, including hair-straightening products that release formaldehyde into the air when heated and specific uses of skin-bleaching agents. Those historically have affected women of color disproportionately compared to white women, in part because they are used in products that change hair and skin texture to conform with Western beauty standards.\n\nPart of the rise in natural beauty has been driven by communities of color looking outside mainstream beauty to brands tailored to their skin and hair types and by immigrant communities seeking products of cultural importance, which are often natural.\n\n\"There's a mythology of the Whole Foods soccer mom and affluent white women, but a lot of this is also driven by communities of color who are not necessarily affluent who are making really important choices for themselves and their families,\" said Christine Keihm, senior vice president of marketing for Nubian Heritage.\n\nNubian Heritage co-founders Richelieu Dennis, Nyema Tubman and Mary Dennis have focused their 20-year-old brand on things such as shea butter and African black soap common in their family home of Liberia. There's been a welcome uptick in research around those types of ingredients, making them easier to use in skincare products, said Ozohu Adoh, founder and CEO of Epara, a luxury skincare line tailored to women of color that recently launched in the U.S.\n\n\"The things that our African grandmothers told us, those kind of folklore or folktales, we now are starting to understand the scientific underpinnings of those claims they used to make,\" Adoh said.\n\nRoom for agreement\n\nThe benefit of research on all potential ingredients, and the need for more of it, is another unifier in the beauty world.\n\nThe FDA announced plans this month to conduct a web-based survey about allergens in cosmetics, with aims of helping the agency better understand consumer decisions, perceptions and allergen awareness.\n\nMost people \u201cwant to know what the facts are, and the problem is we don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d said Dr. Lynn A. Drake, a dermatology faculty member at Massachusetts General Hospital and lecturer at Harvard Medical School.\n\nDrake cites the need for more legitimate controlled clinical trials and transparency with ingredients. All of which goes a long way to clear up consumer confusion and build trust.\n\n\"It\u2019s easy to trivialize some things like cosmetics. Is your lipstick as important as the pill for your heart?\" she asks. \"But little do we know that down the line one of these products might have something in it that could harm you.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/11/21/clean-beauty-truth-talc-parabens-makeup-ingredients/1897128002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/16/alcohol-deaths-emergency-room-increase-middle-aged-women-addiction-opioids/1593347002/", "text": "CLOSE Ron Byrd remembers losing his daughter Erika to complications of alcohol abuse, despite he and his wife June's best efforts.

The death rate rose 24 percent.\n\nOne alarming statistic: Deaths among women rose 85 percent. Women once drank far less than men, and their more moderate drinking helped prevent heart disease, offsetting some of the harm.\n\nDeaths among men rose 29 percent.\n\nWhile teen deaths from drinking were down about 16 percent during the same period, deaths among people aged 45 to 64 rose by about a quarter.\n\nPeople's risk of dying, of course, increases as they age.

Southern states typically rank near the bottom in national rankings in cancer, cardiovascular disease and overall health.\n\nOklahoma, Utah, Kansas and Tennessee rounded out the five states with the strongest alcohol control policies, the researchers reported.

The number of teenage binge drinkers landing in the ER during that time actually declined.\n\nOlder, often lifelong drinkers don't need only to have their stomachs pumped. They frequently have multiple complications from their drinking.\n\nTheir often bulbous bellies need to be drained of fluid, which builds up from liver cirrhosis, and their lungs cleared of aspirated vomit, says Dr. Anthony Marchetti, an emergency room doctor at Upson Regional Medical Center in Thomaston, Georgia.\n\nThey might also have brain hemorrhages or internal bleeding, because booze prevents their blood from clotting properly.\n\nBy middle age, Marchetti says, long-term drinking can also lead to heart failure, infections due to immune suppression, a type of dementia from alcohol-induced brain damage, stomach ulcers and a much higher risk of cancer.\n\nAs opioid overdoses, which kill about 72,000 people a year, grabbed America's attention, the slower moving epidemic of alcohol accelerated, especially in Southern states and the nation's capital. About 88,000 people die each year from alcohol.\n\nMaking matters worse, alcoholism is trickier to treat \u2013 and criticize \u2013 than opioid addiction.\n\n\"Culturally, we\u2019ve made it acceptable to drink but not to go out and shoot up heroin,\" Miller says. \"A lot of people will read this and say 'What's the problem?' \"\n\nBenjamin Miller is a psychologist and the chief strategy officer at the non profit Well Being Trust. (Photo: Well Being Trust)\n\nIt might be a more socially acceptable addiction, but alcoholism is at least three times costlier to treat than opioid addiction, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it's a far more complicated midlife crisis to address.\n\nThe proven approaches \u2013 taxes on alcohol and limits on where and when alcohol is sold \u2013 are often rejected because the liquor industry has considerable clout with policymakers.\n\nRon Byrd says his daughter Erika was \"beautiful inside and out.\"\n\nTo him, there's no question about what caused her death.\n\nThat's despite the fact there was no alcohol in her system when she was found dead at home. She was so sick, Byrd says, she hadn't been able to eat or drink for days.\n\n\"The death certificate never says alcoholism,\" he says. \"It said heart arrhythmia and heart valve disease. But nobody in our family had heart problems.\"\n\nAttorney Lisa Smith has been in recovery from alcohol and cocaine addiction for a decade. The New York City woman wrote the memoir \"Girl Walks Out of a Bar\" and co-hosts the podcast Recovery Rocks.\n\nAttorney Lisa Smith is the author of Girl Walks Out of a Bar, her award-winning memoir of high-functioning addiction and recovery in the world of New York City corporate law. (Photo: Courtesy of Lisa Smith)\n\nSmithspeaks at legal conferences and law firms such as Byrd's about the hazards of lawyers' high-stress days and booze-fueled dinners with clients. But she's fighting forces far larger than her profession.\n\n\"It is poison, and we\u2019re treating it like it's something other than that because there\u2018s big corporate money behind it,\" she says. \"A lot of people are getting really rich on something that is toxic to us.\"\n\nDeaths of despair\n\nIn its Pain in the Nation report this year, the Well Being Trust called losses from drugs, alcohol and suicide \"despair deaths.\"\n\nThe three are closely related. Suicide is the third leading cause of death from alcohol, after cancers anddigestive diseases. One in five individuals who die from opioid overdoses have alcohol in their system at the time of their death.\n\nDrinking can lead to cancers all along the digestive tract, from the mouth to the colon. About 15 percent of U.S. breast cancer cases are considered to be caused by alcohol. A third of those cases affected women who drank 1.5 drinks or less a week, according to a 2013 report in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nThe \"direct toxicity\" of alcohol damages the nervous system from the brain down to the spinal cord and to peripheral nerves, says Marchetti, the Georgia emergency physician. It's common for people in the late stages of alcoholism to have numbness in their feet and legs, which makes walking difficult even when they aren't impaired.\n\nEmergency rooms are the most expensive place to treat problems. Between 2008 and 2014, the rate of ER visits involving acute alcohol consumption rose nearly 40 percent, according to the study in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. For chronic alcohol use, the rate rose nearly 60 percent.\n\nThe increases for acute and chronic alcohol use were larger for women.\n\nPeople who drink throughout their lifetime develop a tolerance for alcohol. But as they age, they lose muscle and gain fat and become less tolerant.\n\nThat leads to increased injuries and illnesses, says Rick Grucza, an associate professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis and lead author of the Alcoholism study.\n\nBut why are so many people drowning so many sorrows?\n\nAshley Marie Hartshorn began drinking heavily after the birth of her third child and a murder committed by her stepfather. (Photo: Family photo)\n\nBrenda Padgett believes it was postpartum depression that led her daughter to take up the heavy drinking that ultimately killed her last year.\n\nAshley Hartshorn, who lived in Hendersonville, North Carolina, had already suffered the trauma of hearing her stepfather kill his girlfriend while she was on the phone.\n\nThen Hartshorn testified against him in court, which helped send him to prison for life.\n\nThe depression came after the birth of her third child in February 2012.\n\n\"She wanted so badly to quit drinking, but the shame and the fear kept her from being able to allow herself to reach out for help,\" Padgett says. \"Like many, we were ignorant to the effects that alcohol has on the body. I thought she had time, time to hit rock bottom and time to seek help.\n\n\"I never knew that only five years of alcohol abuse could take the life of someone so young.\"\n\nNeither did Nancy Juracka. Her son Lance died in 2006 after just three years of heavy drinking. He was 36.\n\nLance Juracka, who grew up in Hermosa Beach, California, was intimately familiar with the scourge of alcoholism: He knew an uncle and aunt had drunk themselves to death before he was born. He even produced a short documentary about alcohol abuse while at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nHe started drinking when he got a job in Las Vegas reviewing shows \u2013 and was continually offered free drinks.\n\n\"Once he got a taste for alcohol, it really did him in fast,\" his mother says. \"I don\u2019t understand how Lance\u2019s liver went so quick.\"\n\nHe headed back to California and ultimately moved back in with his mother.\n\nHe started a painting business. But his workers told Juracka he would just drink vodka or sleep.\n\n\"I thought I was going to lose my mind, I was so frantic,\" she says. \"I would sit up all night with him so he wouldn\u2019t choke on this vomit.\"\n\nJoseph Garbely, an internal and addiction medicine physician at Caron Treatment Centers in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, says research shows that 10 percent of parents think having two or more alcoholic drinks a day is reasonable to reduce their stress.\n\nBut why? It's not as if liquor is becoming more accepted.\n\nConsider, however, the lack of public service announcements about the effect excessive alcohol has on health or families.\n\nAli Mokdad is a professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. He notes that alcohol-related education focuses on drunk driving.\n\nMiller and others point to the high level of workplace stress that began accelerating during the recession, loneliness linked to social media and increasing pressures on working mothers.\n\nIn fact, social isolation can be both a cause and the result of excessive drinking. Parents whose children drank themselves to death in their 20s and 30s often describe the drinking in isolation seen in elderly alcoholics.\n\nFew who drink excessively while young will become alcoholics, much less drink themselves to death. Those who are in recovery for alcoholism say people who turn high school or college binge drinking into a nightly coping ritual are at the most risk.\n\nAmy Durham came close to dying from alcohol six years ago, when she was 40. And she barely drank until she was in her 30s.\n\nThe child of an alcoholic father, Durham never thought she could or would lose control.\n\n\"I didn't even know what was happening to me,\" she says.\n\nShe attributes her plunge into alcoholism to unresolved trauma from growing up in an alcoholic home, the stress of her work as a school principal, a \"toxic\" romantic relationship and grief over an inability to get pregnant.\n\n\"I just needed to be numb,\" she says.\n\nRon and June Byrd lost their daughter, Erika, to complications from chronic alcohol abuse in 2011. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY)\n\nRon Byrd says Erika, too, dreamed of having children. After two divorces and stage 3b breast cancer, however, the chance was slipping away.\n\n\"She wanted so desperately to have a baby,\" Byrd says.\n\nDurham is now corporate director of alumni relations at Pennsylvania-based Caron Treatment Centers, where she was treated.\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t able to see that my drinking was a problem until it was almost too late,\" she says. \"I put limits on myself and would say that i'd only drink two glasses of wine in a social setting and then go home and drink a lot in isolation.\"\n\nWhen her father died in July 2012 of esophageal cancer, Durham says, she began a \"very bad downward spiral.\"\n\nShe remembers his funeral.\n\n\"i was trying to be nothing like my father, but I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of that church and drink,\" she says. \"The shame of what was happening to me was more than I could bear.\"\n\nLike Hartshorn and Byrd, Durham started with white wine. But she ended up drinking copious amounts of vodka.\n\nAmy Durham, now director of alumni relations at Caron Treatment Centers, is shown with Caron's Dr. Joseph Garbely, who helped save her after alcohol nearly killed her. (Photo: Caron Treatment Centers)\n\nBy the time her family got her to a hospital, Durham was in triple organ failure and wound up in a coma for 10 days.\n\nThat was followed by six weeks of dialysis.\n\nWhen she arrived at in-patient rehab after the dialysis, Durham says, her body and eyes were still yellow and she was carrying 100 extra pounds of fluid \u2013 half of it in her legs.\n\nShe says fellow rehab residents \u2013 no strangers to the telltale signs of addiction \u2013 quickly looked away as she passed.\n\nMen vs. women drinkers\n\nWhen men crash and burn from alcohol, Mokdad says, the spectacle is often public. They get into bar fights, get cited by police for drunk driving or lose heir jobs.\n\nA more typical trajectory for women starts with evening wine as a way to de-stress from the work day \u2013 either in a professional setting, or home with young children.\n\nAuthor and podcast co-host Stefanie Wilder-Taylor, writer of \"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay,\" believes this stems from stubborn gender roles and norms surrounding stress.\n\n\"Moms just aren't going to call home and say they're stopping for a couple drinks after work with friends or going to the gym to unwind,\" the Los Angeles woman says\n\nOtherwise, they might feel like parenting failures as they compare themselves to other moms. So they drink wine while they make dinner, which can lead to a nightly pattern of excessive drinking.\n\nAuthor Stefanie Wilder-Taylor co-hosts the podcast For Crying Out Loud and is in recovery from alcohol addiction. (Photo: Courtesy of Stefanie Wilder-Taylor)\n\nThat describes nurse practitioner Eileen O'Grady, who quit drinking 12 years ago.\n\nO'Grady, who lives in McLean, Virginia, says her two sons, now in college, never really saw her drunk. But she couldn't bear the thought of continuing her destructive double life. She would drink continually from dinner until she went to sleep, she says, and then start again the next evening.\n\nFor O'Grady, the last straw came after a night of especially hard drinking with another mom in her neighborhood.\n\nThe other woman, a schoolteacher, vomited in O'Grady's car. She returned the next day to clean it up.\n\nO'Grady hasn't taken another drink.\n\n\"I could see my life if I kept going,\" O'Grady says. She is now active in her local recovery community and working as a wellness coach.\n\nHer schoolteacher friend taught classes until last fall. Within days of leaving the classroom, she was in a hospital with end-stage liver disease.\n\nShe died in hospice on Jan. 3.\n\nAt least 15 people at the woman's memorial service asked O'Grady how her friend had died. They were stunned to learn alcohol was the cause.\n\nThe woman was poisoning herself with a half-gallon of vodka a day, O'Grady says, yet no one knew beyond her immediate family, O'Grady and a mutual friend in the neighborhood.\n\n\"We're closeted,\" O'Grady says. \"We're not in bars getting in fights.\"\n\nEileen O'Grady is a nurse practitioner and wellness coach who has been in recovery from alcohol for 12 years. (Photo: Courtesy of Eileen O'Grady)\n\nAs for Durham, she was on a liver transplant list for about five months in 2011 and 2012. Then she learned she no longer needed a new liver.\n\n\"Livers have a great capacity for recovery,\" says Dr. Michael Lucey, a professor and head of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Wisconsin medical school.\n\nDurham was once in a sorority at University of Mississippi, where beauty was competitive and a popular saying was \"pretty is as pretty does.\"\n\n\"But there was nothing pretty about my drinking,\" she says.\n\nIf she had been diagnosed with breast cancer, Durham says, she wouldn't think twice about getting treatment and talking about it.\n\nDurham stopped drinking six years ago Thursday. She says she surprises people with how openly she shares the gritty details of her near-death experience.\n\n\"I want to show the world what recovery looks like, especially for women where stigma is still the way it is,\" Durham says. \"I want people to know there is hope.\"\n\nErika Byrd, who died in 2011 due to alcohol, is shown with her mother June Byrd in Waikiki Beach at sunset in Hawaii in 2003.

And those moves could reshape issues such as gun control, affirmative action and religious freedom. But the appointments some call Trump's crowning achievement may slow down during his third year.

(Feb. 6) AP\n\nAs the United States prepares a full drawdown of forces in Syria, former defense and intelligence officials are concerned with the region\u2019s stability and a repeat of what happened when ISIS emerged after the United States left Iraq in 2011.\n\nPresident Trump vowed a change in policy in his 2019 State of the Union Speech. As he specifically promised a reduction of troop presence and focus on counterterrorism, he stated: \u201cGreat nations do not fight endless wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long-standing campaign talking point for him, but I think the real problem was the fact that it was not done through any sort of process,\u201d said Joseph Collins, former deputy assistant secretary of Defense for stability operations.\n\nTrump predicted all ISIS-held territory in Syria would be regained by the second week of February, but many U.S. military and intelligence officials still consider the extremist group a threat. ISIS as a terrorist group, and as an ideology is very much alive, according to Brian Katz, a former Defense Department official.\n\nCLOSE Without specifically addressing Hoda Muthana, the American Islamic State bride, a U.S. State Department spokesman spoke broadly about options. USA TODAY\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just not physically holding and defending the area anymore. They\u2019re in the rural areas in Iraq and Syria,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably started re-infiltrating some of the areas that were cleared by the counter-ISIS forces, rebuilding those clandestine networks to be able to launch attacks if there is the more significant drawdown of U.S. troops if there is a collapse of our local partner forces again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to continually pursue these groups until there\u2019s almost nothing left. And we did it one time before,\u201d said Collins. \u201cWe did the best job that anyone has ever done in history and it still came back to bite us.\u201d\n\nLooking back at al-Qaeda extremists who became ISIS fighters after Obama\u2019s withdrawal, Collins said the United States should have learned its lesson.\n\n\u201cAl-Qaeda in Iraq was the most thoroughly destroyed terrorist group in history,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen U.S. forces and our special operators were done, there were only a few hundred of these stragglers who were left.\u201d\n\nCLOSE In an unannounced trip to Iraq on Wednesday, President Donald Trump defended his decision to withdraw troops from Syria despite criticism from military officials and allies who don't think the job fighting Islamic State militants there is over. (Dec. 26) AP\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s disregard for protocol to discuss policy with officials before making a public comment via press conference or tweets has left issues unresolved such as adjudicating foreign fighters and leaving local allies without support, Collins said.\n\n\u201cThis is where the international community has to work together, including the U.S., because there are a lot of foreign terrorist fighters out of Iraq,\u201d Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Alhakim said at a recent event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what is the next step.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted about the issue, calling on European allies to put 800 captured ISIS fighters on trial.\n\n\u201cThe Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!\u201d\n\nWithout a policy decision from leaders, the future status of these fighters is unknown.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make foreign fighters stateless \u2014 it encourages that individual not being connected to law-abiding societies whether its integration or any sort of accountability and heightens the risk of them pursuing extremist ideologies,\u201d said Melissa Dalton, a former assistant of the secretary of Defense for policy.\n\nAlhakim said U.S. policy should include working with partners to eliminate ISIS control east of the Euphrates River. But Collins criticized the United States\u2019 unilateral actions which he said have occurred since the George W. Bush administration, but has \u201cbeen raised to an art form in the past two years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States consistently disregards the interests of our allies who are fighting with us and in fact dying with us,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a massive dose of unilateralism and we do not treat our regional allies or even our NATO allies with the respect they deserve.\u201d\n\nCurrently, U.S. soldiers are fighting with Syrian Democratic forces, Kurdish fighters and Iraqi security forces, which are also made up of Iraq Shia militia, backed by Iran.\n\nIn a recent interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Trump said the presence of American troops in Iraq was to keep an eye on Iran. Katz said it might be an element of it, but it makes it more complicated for the Iraqi politicians trying to rebuild their country.\n\n\u201cThe more difficult Western partners make it for these [Iraqi] politicians to support a U.S. presence, the higher the risk of an ISIS resurgence and potentially conflict with Iran,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThe last thing the people of Iraq want to be drug into is a conflict between the U.S. and Iran played out in Iraq.\u201d\n\nAs for the fighters, Dalton said leaving the area may make it easier for Turkey to infringe upon the rights of Kurdish entities.\n\n\u201cPeople who\u2019ve been fighting with us against ISIS, against Assad, and against the Russians and Iranians, are now trying to figure out \u2014 how are they going to survive? That\u2019s one of the issues that has to be worked out in these inner agency meetings that never took place,\u201d Collins said.\n\nKatz said most military analysts believe keeping a small presence of 1,000 or 2,000 troops to train local forces and provide air support, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance is a good investment and can keep \u201csteady pressure on ISIS which prevents them from adapting and re-emerging.\u201d\n\nOfficials agree that a pull out without regard for the region\u2019s future will influence how the United States is viewed on the world stage. U.S. withdrawal may also give way to Russian and Iranian influence, as well as Turkish influence in the east, which Dalton said may restrict future humanitarian aid access in Syria.\n\n\"If the U.S. is not honoring its commitments to partners and allies, then the going gets tough down the road. What reason do they have to honor those commitments with us?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a very rocky and troubling road that we are walking ourselves down.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/02/21/trump-odds-former-us-military-intel-officials-over-syria/2944979002/"}, {"source": "usa", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/nation/2019/01/07/see-impact-partial-government-shutdown/2502716002/", "text": "None\n\nChris George, a federal employee furloughed from his job as a forestry technician supervisor for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, takes off his boots at his home adorned with an American flag after spending the day working as a handyman Saturday, Jan. 19, 2019, in Hemet, Calif. \"I have a lot of pride, so asking for help is difficult for me.
