Police allege that Smollett hired the two brothers to help stage the Jan. 29 attack, which he described to police as racist and homophobic. Smollett is African-American and gay.\n\nHe allegedly paid $3,500 to the brothers, identified by their attorney as Abimbola (\"Abel\") and Olabinjo (\"Ola\") Osundairo.\n\nAssistant State's Attorney Risa Lanier said at a news conference after a court hearing Thursday that Smollett even pointed out to the brothers a specific surveillance camera he thought would capture footage of the attack when he drove them to the scene near his apartment two days ahead of time. But police say the camera was pointed another way during the staged attack.\n\nOne of Smollett's attorneys, Jack Prior, told the judge during the hearing Thursday afternoon that Smollett \"maintains these are outrageous allegations\" and denies they are true.\n\n\"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett seen in a Chicago court room Thu., Feb. 21, 2019.

Smollett's attorneys asked for him to be freed on his own recognizance, but the judge, who is also black, rejected that idea and said he was particularly bothered by the allegations involving the noose.\n\nSmollett said little during the hearing, except to state his name. He was joined in the courtroom by family members and didn't comment as he left court. He later posted bond and was released from jail. The actor walked out in a group of people and to a waiting SUV. He didn't speak to the large media contingent waiting outside.\n\nJussie Smollett exits Cook County Department of Corrections after posting bail in Chicago, Ill., on Thu., Feb. 21, 2019. Reuters\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson blasted Smollett at a press conference earlier Thursday, saying the actor orchestrated the attack as a \"publicity stunt\" because he was dissatisfied with his salary.\n\n\"When we discovered the actual motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off,\" Johnson said.\n\nLate Thursday, details about Smollett's salary was released. He is earning more than $100,000 per episode of \"Empire,\" according to a person familiar with the situation who told AP. The studio declined to comment on the actor's salary. As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on \"Empire\" received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama's renewal for a second season, the person said. Smollett is counted among the series regulars.\n\nBefore the attack, Smollett also sent an anonymous threatening letter to himself at the studio in Chicago where \"Empire\" is shot, Johnson said. The FBI has been investigating the threatening letter. Johnson would not say whether Smollett could face additional charges for that.\n\nChicago police chief on Jussie Smollett arrest\n\nLanier said Smollett knew the brothers, who both worked on \"Empire\" with him. He first recruited them to plan the attack during a conversation in his car Jan. 25, allegedly asking one of the brothers if he could trust him.\n\nHe told the brothers to catch his attention by yelling \"Empire F--\" and \"Empire N----\" before launching into the attack, Lanier said. He then allegedly detailed how they should carry it out: \"He wanted Abel to attack him, but not hurt him too badly, and give him the chance to appear to fight back,\" Lanier said.\n\nHe wanted Ola to place the rope around his neck and yell, \"This is MAGA country,\" Lanier said.\n\nLanier said Smollett gave the brothers $100 to buy rope, gasoline, ski masks, gloves, and a red baseball hat resembling those with Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Their purchases were apparently caught on surveillance video at a local store.\n\nStore surveillance video obtained by CBS Chicago shows brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo buying items sources say were used a day later in a staged attack on Jussie Smollett. CBS Chicago\n\nLanier said Smollett initially told the brothers to pour gasoline on him, but the plan later changed and he told them to use bleach. Lanier said the plan was for the attack to take place the night of Jan. 28, but it was delayed when his flight was late to arrive into Chicago.\n\nLanier said Smollett told Abel over the phone just before 1 a.m. the attack should take place near the location he had earlier indicated at 2 a.m. Surveillance video captured the brothers waiting nearby for Smollett, who was about four minutes late, Lanier said. The brothers then \"staged the attack just as Smollett had instructed them,\" Lanier said.\n\nLanier said a witness who had parked her car near the attack around the same time didn't report hearing anything, though Smollett had claimed \"his attackers were yelling racial and homophobic slurs, and he was yelling back.\"\n\nWhen police arrived at Smollett's apartment after the report, Smollett still had the rope around his neck and asked police to turn off their body cameras, Lanier said. He indicated to police the camera that might have captured the attack, and also for the first time reported a phone call he said he received days earlier during which the caller said \"Hey you little F-----\" before hanging up, Lanier said.\n\nLanier said that statements Smollett made in his \"Good Morning America\" interview were intended to mislead the public into believing that his attackers were white. The brothers are black.\n\n\"I feel like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,\" Smollett told \"GMA.\"\n\nChicago police express anger over Jussie Smollett case\n\nSmollett's story was met with intense questions from both police and the public. In less than a month, Smollett went from being the seemingly sympathetic victim of a hate crime to being accused of fabricating the entire thing. The 36-year-old was charged Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct, a charge that could bring up to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his claims.\n\nPolice treated Smollett as a victim until the two brothers, who had been taken into custody for questioning, admitted to helping him stage the attack, Johnson said. Initially called \"possible suspects,\" they are now being treated as witnesses.\n\nIt was the brothers who also explained Smollett's alleged motive to detectives. Authorities have obtained a check for $3,500 that Smollett paid the brothers, he said.\n\nIn describing what police believe actually happened, Johnson made it sound as if Smollett was casting and directing a short movie.\n\n\"He probably knew he needed somebody with bulk,\" he said of Smollett's decision to hire the two muscular brothers. Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer.\n\nThe brothers wore gloves during the staged attack and \"punched him a little bit,\" Johnson said. The scratches and bruising Smollett had on his face were \"most likely self-inflicted,\" Johnson said.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, defense attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett \"enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.\"\n\nThe companies that make \"Empire,\" Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, issued a statement Thursday saying they were \"evaluating the situation\" and \"considering our options.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eddie-johnson-chicago-police-department-superintendent-calls-jussie-smollet-attack-hoax-shameful-in-news-conference-today-2019-02-21/", "text": "Chicago's top police officer expressed anger and frustration Thursday over what he called Jussie Smollett's \"shameful\" attempt to fabricate a hate crime for a \"publicity stunt.\"\n\n\"When we discovered the actual motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off,\" said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. He said police were treating Smollett like a victim until then.\n\nSmollett's story that he was attacked January 29 by masked assailants who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and hung a rope around his neck unraveled when two of Smollett's acquaintances, brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, told investigators the actor paid them $3,500 to stage the attack, said Johnson.\n\nJohnson said Smollett, 36, choreographed the attack because he was dissatisfied with his salary. He castigated Smollett for putting the national spotlight on Chicago for something \"that is both egregious and untrue,\" and said bogus police reports harm legitimate victims by wasting valuable police resources.\n\nSpeaking on CBSN following the press conference in Chicago, CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds said he's covered Johnson for several years and has \"seldom heard him as angry as he was today.\"\n\n\"What he said was a mixture of contempt, disgust and basic anger,\" Reynolds said.\n\nThe \"Empire\" actor turned himself in on a felony count of filing a false police report. He appeared in court Thursday afternoon where a judge set his bond at $100,000 and ordered him to turn in his passport. Smollett soon walked out of jail after posting the necessary $10,000 and headed to a black SUV as a horde of reporters swarmed the area.\n\nHe went to the \"Empire\" set later in the day, 20th Century Fox confirmed to CBS News late Thursday.\n\nJussie Smollett exits Cook County Department of Corrections after posting bail in Chicago, Ill., on Thu., Feb. 21, 2019. Reuters\n\nJohnson said Smollett hasn't made any statement to police since his arrest.\n\nHis legal team, which now includes famed criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos, defended him in a statement after he was charged Wednesday night.\n\n\"Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,\" the statement said. \"Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.\"\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Smollett's lawyers said Johnson's detailing investigators' findings about the alleged attack amounted to an \"organized law enforcement spectacle,\" and said they had no place in the American legal system. The statement described Smollett as a man of \"impeccable character and integrity\" who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.\n\nJohnson gave credit to his detectives for a \"patient and deliberate\" investigation that he said began with giving Smollett the benefit of the doubt and eventually uncovered the truth after weeks of combing through video evidence and following up on leads. He called Smollett a \"troubled young man who resorted to both drastic and illegal actions.\"\n\nJussie Smollett turned himself in, charged with filing false police report\n\n\"I'm offended by what's happened, and I'm also angry,\" Johnson said. \"I love the city of the Chicago and the Chicago Police Department, warts and all. But this publicity stunt was a scar Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve.\"\n\nJohnson expressed dismay that the alleged hoax received national media attention for weeks. He said that Chicago police investigated the case as they would any other hate crime, and insisted it didn't take away resources from investigations into the shootings and homicides that have plagued the city. He also took the media to task, calling for the same level of coverage for victims of gun violence.\n\nJohnson said Thursday he spoke not only as the police superintendent, but as a black man who grew up in Chicago and understands the city's racial divide. He said Smollett \"took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career\" and said he was baffled as to why anyone, especially an African-American man, \"would use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations.\"\n\n\"How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?\" Johnson said. \"How could this individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?\"\n\nJohnson said the department would continue to investigate hate crimes with the same vigor, but feared that victims of hate crimes will \"be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn't happen.\"\n\nHe called for Smollett to admit his actions and apologize.\n\n\"Absolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared, admitting what he did, and then being man enough to offer what he should offer up in terms of all the resources that were put into this,\" Johnson said."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tnt-cancels-drop-the-mic-episode-jussie-smollett-danielle-brooks-clay-aiken-ian-ziering-2019-02-21/", "text": "TNT said Thursday it isn't going to air an upcoming episode of \"Drop the Mic\" featuring \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett \"in the interest of not being exploitative of an incredibly sensitive situation.\" The cable network said it would shelve the episode of the battle-rap show that pitted Smollett against Danielle Brooks, an actress on \"Orange is the New Black.\"\n\nInstead it will air an episode that features actress Raven-Symon\u00e9 taking on comedian Ron Funches.

And right on time, at 8:45 p.m. EST (GMT-5) Thursday, the rocket's nine first-stage engines thundered to life again and the Falcon 9 shot away from its firing stand atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust.\n\nThe first stage shut down and fell away two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff. While the second stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage, making its third flight, plunged back toward a landing on a SpaceX droneship, the \"Of Course I Still Love You,\" stationed east of Cape Canaveral.\n\nConsidered an especially challenging return because of the Falcon 9's trajectory, the booster restarted its central engine as it neared the recovery ship, extended four landing legs and settled to a pinpoint touchdown. SpaceX's first stage landing record now stands at 34 successful touchdowns, 22 on droneships and 12 on land.\n\nThis was SpaceX's second mission so far this year, it's first from Cape Canaveral since December and the company's 68th Falcon 9 launch overall, its 69th counting the maiden flight of a three-core Falcon Heavy in February 2018.\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket flashes to life and climbs away from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station carrying an Indonesian communications satellite, a small experimental U.S. Air Force satellite and an Israeli moon lander that will attempt the first privately funded lunar landing in April.

Known as Nusantara Satu, the relay station will provide a broad range of telecommunications services across the Indonesian archipelago.\n\nThe comsat also carried a small U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory satellite, known as S5, that will be released to operate on its own in a circular orbit 22,300 miles above the equator. The experimental satellite will use an optical sensor to monitor the environment at that altitude where scores of communications stations are stationed. The goal is to improve \"space situational awareness.\"\n\nBut the clear star of the show is the Beresheet moon lander.\n\nDesigned by SpaceIL and built by Israel Aerospace Industries for the since-canceled Google Lunar X-prize competition, Beresheet is the first Israeli spacecraft designed to visit the moon or any other world. The goal is to spur interest in STEM careers among students in Israel.\n\n\"Israel is a very small country, as small as New Jersey, and we're shooting for the moon,\" said Yigal Harel, SpaceIL manager of Beresheet program. \"It's the first time a small country has aimed to reach the moon and land safely. We are the first non-governmental mission to the moon, and we're the first ever moon mission to use a commercial launch.\"\n\nThe Falcon 9 launch for Beresheet and the Air Force S5 satellite was arranged by Seattle-based Spaceflight, a company that has pioneered \"rideshare\" launch opportunities for small satellites that do not require a dedicated rocket. For Wednesday's launch, Spaceflight negotiated rideshares through SSL (formerly Space Systems/Loral), builder of the PSN 6 satellite.\n\nBeresheet separated from the Falcon 9's second stage about 33 minutes after launch, released into a highly elliptical orbit with a high point, or apogee, of about 37,000 miles. That's the \"transfer\" orbit required by Nusantara Satu, which will use on-board thrusters to reach its operational 22,300-mile-high circular orbit above Indonesia.\n\nAn artist's impression of the Beresheet moon lander.

During the final descent to the surface, a magnetometer will measure the local magnetic field before the main engine shuts down at an altitude of about 16 feet. From there, the spacecraft will free fall to the surface.\n\nBeresheet is equipped with a high-resolution camera to capture panoramic views of the landing site to help scientists better understand the area.

Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, was ordered held without bail on drug and gun charges while prosecutors gather evidence to support more serious charges involving what they portrayed as a domestic terror plot by a man who espoused white-supremacist views.\n\nHasson, a former Marine who worked at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington on a program to acquire advanced new cutters for the agency, was arrested last week. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports Hasson had a \"Secret\"-level security clearance. Investigators gave no immediate details on how or when he came to their attention.\n\nFederal agents found 15 guns, including several rifles, and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition inside his basement apartment in Silver Spring, Maryland. Hasson, wearing a maroon jumpsuit in court, listened to the prosecutor's presentation often with his chin in his hands, and glanced at a photo of the weapons that were displayed on a screen, CBS News producer Jane Chick reported.\n\nAn arsenal of firearms found in the home of Christopher Hasson. U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland\n\nIn court papers this week, federal prosecutors said he compiled what appeared to be a computer-spreadsheet hit list that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and presidential hopefuls Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. Also mentioned were such figures as MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN's Chris Cuomo and Van Jones.\n\nIn arguing against bail Thursday, federal prosecutor Jennifer Sykes said Hasson would log onto his government computer during work and spend hours searching for information on such people as the Unabomber, the Virginia Tech gunman and anti-abortion bomber Eric Rudolph.\n\nSykes said the charges so far are just the \"tip of the iceberg\" and called Hasson a \"domestic terrorist\" who appeared to be planning attacks inspired by the manifesto of Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including dozens of teenagers at a summer camp, in a 2011 bomb-and-shooting rampage. Sykes said Hasson identified as a white nationalist in writings obtained by the government.\n\nPublic defender Julie Stelzig accused prosecutors of making inflammatory accusations against her client without providing the evidence to back them up. \"It is not a crime to think negative thoughts about people,\" she said.\n\nShe also questioned whether the government is trying to make an example out of Hasson, given criticism that authorities have overlooked domestic terrorists.\n\n\"Perhaps now they can say, 'Look, we're not targeting only Muslims,'\" she said.\n\nStelzig said Hasson doesn't have a criminal record and has served 28 years in the Coast Guard. She described him as a \"committed public servant\" and a loving husband and father.\n\nStelzig said none of Hasson's computer searches cited by the government amounted to specific plans, Chick reported. She said any perceived danger had to be based on facts and asked that he be released back home to his wife.\n\nHasson spent about $14,000 on weapons, survival gear and other equipment between 2017 and 2018, Sykes said. However, Stelzig argued that the number of firearms found in Hasson's apartment is \"modest, at best\" for many gun collectors in other parts of the country.\n\n\"There is nothing I'm seeing in here that would show he was stockpiling weapons,\" Stelzig said.\n\nShe said the prosecution's detention memo offered up a \"histrionic characterization of Mr. Hasson\" and was intended to garner media attention, Chick reported.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Charles Day agreed to keep Hasson behind bars but said he is willing to revisit his decision in 14 days if prosecutors haven't brought more serious charges by then.\n\nHasson was previously an aircraft mechanic in the Marines, serving from 1988 to 1994.\n\nCourt papers detail a 2017 draft email in which he wrote that he was \"dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth.\"\n\nAlso, Hasson sent himself a draft letter in 2017 that he had written to a neo-Nazi leader and \"identified himself as a White Nationalist for over 30 years and advocated for 'focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland,\" prosecutors said.\n\nStelzig identified that neo-Nazi leader as white separatist Harold Covington. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported that Covington died last July.\n\nLast February, Hasson searched the internet for the \"most liberal senators\" and also asked, \"Do senators have ss (Secret Service) protection\" and \"Are supreme court justices protected,\" according to the court filing.\n\nBob Davis, who rents a house from Hasson in coastal Currituck County, North Carolina, and met him a few times, said he was \"absolutely shocked\" by the allegations.\n\n\"He was a very stern military guy. That's how I saw him. I truly nothing but respected him. There are people in life who are not 100 percenters.

Wade could be overturned, and the laws on abortion access get kicked back to the states.\n\nLouisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota have already passed similar laws. Four more states \u2014 Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee \u2014 have such legislation, dubbed \"trigger\" laws, in the pipeline.\n\n\"What trigger laws do is that they make it clear that the state will ban abortion the moment that Roe is overturned,\" said Andrea Miller, the president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, in a telephone interview with CBS News.\n\nTrigger laws aren't new. When Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, Idaho and South Carolina immediately passed them, though Idaho's was repealed in the 1990s, said Elizabeth Nash, a senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute. Before President Trump took office, one or two conservative states would introduce trigger laws every legislative session, but the measures usually failed. This year has been different.\n\n\"There's been so much more this year,\" Nash said. \"And these are getting attention, they're not just getting introduced and fizzling out like they used to.\"\n\nAbortion activists on both sides of the issue say that there's been a renewed interest in trigger laws because of the increasingly conservative Supreme Court and the potential to overturn Roe. Arkansas State Senator Jason Rapert, the primary sponsor of Arkansas's trigger law, said there was \"a real opportunity in the next couple of years,\" to undo the landmark Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"Even the pro-abortion forces in the country see and sense that there's an opportunity for change,\" Rapert said in a telephone interview with CBS News.\n\nLiberal states are also preparing for that potential, passing laws that would maintain or expand access to abortion. In New York, lawmakers passed the \"Reproductive Health Act\" last month, which allows for abortions after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or if there is risk to the mother's health.\n\nSimilar laws in Virginia and Vermont have been introduced and gained traction as pro-choice politicians have grown concerned, Miller said. \"It would be difficult to overstate how severe the threat to Roe v. Wade is right now.\"\n\n\"You have this set of states who are in a race to the bottom in terms of abortion rights and access and you have another set of states who are stepping up in a moment when Roe v. Wade is under fire,\" Miller said.\n\nIn the coming years, the Supreme Court will have plenty of opportunities to revisit Roe. There are at least 20 specific cases in the pipeline that potentially chip away at abortion access, said Nash. Most abortion activists aren't anticipating a full overturn of the decision, but rather a continual chipping away at the ruling.\n\n\"Rather than just cutting down the tree, I think you're going to see them trimming and pruning it back,\" said Jerry Cox, head of Arkansas's Family Council, in a telephone interview with CBS News. \"I think, and hope, there will be a day in the not so distant future where Roe is virtually irrelevant.\"\n\nCox and his group worked closely with Rapert to pass Arkansas's new trigger law. The law, like the ones in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Dakota, grants exceptions for when the mother's life is in danger. Mississippi and North Dakota would grant exceptions in the event of rape and only North Dakota would allow for exceptions in the case of incest, according to Nash.\n\nNot all advocates who want to limit abortion have bought into trigger law strategy. Rose Mimm, the executive director of Arkansas Right for Life, an anti-abortion rights group, said that her group has been disappointed by recent Supreme Court decisions that haven't restricted abortion access and because of that, they're focusing on immediate outcomes like heartbeat bills and mandatory waiting periods.\n\n\"We're interested in saving babies now,\" Mimm said in a telephone interview with CBS News. \"The trigger bill does nothing to save babies.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-who-joined-al-qaeda-then-turned-informant-speaks-in-first-tv-interview-60-minutes/", "text": "There's no question Bryant Vi\u00f1as betrayed America. What you'll have to decide for yourself is whether he has done enough to atone for his crimes. The New York City man, raised Catholic on Long Island, joined al-Qaeda in 2008. But after he was caught, Vi\u00f1as became an informant cooperating with the FBI. Today, U.S. prosecutors say Bryant Vi\u00f1as may have been the most valuable witness ever in the war on al-Qaeda. Vi\u00f1as impressed prosecutors and the judge in his case so much that they prepared to shield him from the prospect of al-Qaeda's revenge by putting him in the federal witness protection program. All was prepared-- until Bryant Vi\u00f1as says he was double crossed.\n\nScott Pelley: You can assume that al-Qaeda wants to kill you.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Yes.\n\nScott Pelley: Right now, today?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Yes.\n\nScott Pelley: Why be on television?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: To let people know what went wrong.\n\nLife went wrong for Bryant Vi\u00f1as at an early age. He was a troubled teenager-- his mother kicked him out. Vi\u00f1as was searching for purpose and converted to Islam. Later, he was seduced by the online fanaticism of al-Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki.\n\nAnwar al-Awlaki: We are fighting for a noble cause. We are fighting for God.\n\nAl-Awlaki was an American killed back in 2011 by a U.S. drone.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: A lot of his sermons were very captivating, very mesmerizing, I guess you could say. He was talking about the injustices in the world, oppression going on in the Middle East. And it hit me in my heart.\n\nScott Pelley: And you decided that the problems in the Middle East were your problems?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: It was a problem that I could get involved in yes.\n\n\"I gave information on the Long Island Rail Road. A plot on how to attack it, basically, the tunnel that connects all the trains that lead into Manhattan.\"\n\nIn 2007, at the age of 24, Vi\u00f1as journeyed to Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nScott Pelley: You wanted to kill Americans.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: At the time, yes.\n\nVi\u00f1as found himself welcomed by terrorists who had longed for an American recruit who traveled on a U.S. Passport.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: I asked somebody, I said, \"What group is this?\" And he says, \"no, this is al-Qaeda.\" I said, \"This is al-Qaeda?\" And he says yeah. This is not what you see in the videos. This is not what you see on the news.\n\nScott Pelley: What do you mean?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Usually, you see monkey bars where guys are training or crawling underneath barbed wire. And I didn't do any of that. That's not how it was while I was there.\n\nScott Pelley: What type of training did you get in this al-Qaeda camp?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: We did-- basic Soviet weapons. They go a little bit into explosive theory, suicide-bombing vests.\n\nVi\u00f1as says a high ranking al-Qaeda leader asked him for advice on possible targets in the U.S..\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: I gave information on the Long Island Rail Road. A plot on how to attack it, basically, the tunnel that connects all the trains that lead into Manhattan. So, if the tunnel is destroyed, then it would hurt the economy in New York.\n\nScott Pelley: They wanted to attack the economy of the United States.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Yes sir. The death toll isn't really the primary target.\n\nScott Pelley: They'd probably never heard of the Long Island Rail Road before. You might have relatives or friends on the railroad.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Yeah. Very possible. Yeah.\n\nScott Pelley: How do you feel about that now?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Regretful. Actually I'm very thankful nobody got hurt. And it was in the idea stages. And that's as far as it went.\n\nScott Pelley: Did you take part on any attacks on U.S. bases in Afghanistan?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Yes sir. I was part of a defensive team to protect the group that was launching the rockets.\n\nScott Pelley: What was your job?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: In case a Pakistani helicopter came we were supposed to attack that helicopter so it wouldn't attack the group down below.\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Stand on Coney Island, where detectives took Vi\u00f1as to convince him to speak about al-Qaeda\n\nIn 2008, after seven months in terrorist camps, Vi\u00f1as took a short break to visit the city of Peshawar. Apparently, the Pakistanis were watching. He was arrested, turned over to the United States and, within days found himself in federal prison in Brooklyn. There, FBI agents offered him a choice: life in prison or, tell all about al-Qaeda. To help convince him, agents took him to Coney Island.\n\nScott Pelley: They took you to Nathan's Hot Dog Stand?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Well I was in the car. And one detective went and got an order and brought it back--\n\nScott Pelley: And brought you a hot dog?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Hot dogs, burgers, fries, a drink.\n\nScott Pelley: And they showed you around Coney Island and they said, \"You can have a life again.\"\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Yes. He holds out his arms. He says, \"You really wanna go back to-- to prison and go to Supermax for the rest of your life?\" And I said, \"You know what? This is my chance to get a second chance at life.\" And I said, \"You know what? I'll take it.\"\n\nSo Vi\u00f1as decided to plead guilty. His sentencing was postponed until the government could assess the quality of his cooperation. Confined to prison, Vi\u00f1as spent eight years meeting more than 100 times with prosecutors and the FBI.\n\nAndrew McCabe: Vi\u00f1as changed the way we thought about how al-Qaeda recruits and who al-Qaeda recruits.\n\nAndrew McCabe was the head of FBI counterterrorism and oversaw the Vi\u00f1as case. This was before McCabe became better known for opening two investigations of President Trump.\n\nScott Pelley: How valuable was Bryant Vi\u00f1as to the FBI?\n\nAndrew McCabe: Incredibly valuable through his testimony, through his debriefings, identifying people, teaching us how he had walked this pathway from Long Island, New York into al-Qaeda.\n\nScott Pelley: You didn't know that stuff before?\n\nAndrew McCabe: Learning about his experience completely broke the mold from the way that we thought business was happening. Prior to Vi\u00f1as, the idea that any American could just head to Pakistan and go seek out al-Qaeda and affiliate with that group was something we thought couldn't be done.\n\nScott Pelley: He was a game-changer for the FBI, in terms of Al-Qaeda?\n\nAndrew McCabe: I would say so, yes.\n\nFormer acting FBI director Andre McCabe\n\nSteve Zissou: His information has stopped more attacks than you can even conceive of.\n\nSteve Zissou is a defense lawyer with a top security clearance. He's represented several terrorism suspects including Bryant Vi\u00f1as.\n\nSteve Zissou: I have reviewed both classified and unclassified information. And the government's submissions to the court make it unequivocally clear that his information stopped attacks, saved lives, and permitted our military to continue the battle to take it to them, if you will.\n\nScott Pelley: Were drone strikes launched on the basis of his information?\n\nSteve Zissou: No doubt about it.\n\nVi\u00f1as' defense attorney points to drone strikes that killed 14 suspected jihadists where Vi\u00f1as had lived.\n\nScott Pelley: So they were killing these people who used to be your friends.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Yes sir.\n\nScott Pelley: How did you feel about that?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: At one time they were my friends. But, you know, if I have to leave that life behind, I can't have them be my friends no more.\n\n\"I was shocked that they took such a cavalier irresponsible step as they did to deny Mr. Vi\u00f1as witness protection.\"\n\nIn 2017, prosecutors wrote this to the judge in Vi\u00f1as' case, Nicholas Garaufis: \"To say that the defendant provided substantial assistance to the government is an understatement. Indeed, he may have been the single most valuable cooperating witness\u2026with respect to al-Qaeda...\" Judge Garaufis agreed, adding that Vi\u00f1as had placed his life in \"grave danger\" to help his country.\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: He was the extraordinary case. Mr. Vi\u00f1as has certain God-given gifts, one of which is that he has a photographic memory. He remembered every place he had been. He remembered most of the people he had met. He was able to explain to the government how Al Qaeda recruits that's why he was so valuable.\n\nWith that in mind, Judge Garaufis, ruled that the eight years vi\u00f1as had spent cooperating from a prison cell were enough.\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: The sentence was time served with an additional 90 days.\n\nScott Pelley: Why 90 days?\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: In order for him to have the opportunity to be placed in Witness Protection once he's released.\n\nScott Pelley: So it was your understanding that he was going to be brought into the witness protection program.\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: Yes, it absolutely was.\n\nScott Pelley: And what happened?\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: On the 88th day of the 90-day period, I was advised that he had been refused witness protection status by this office at the Justice Department, the Office of Enforcement Operations. There had never been a problem before in any of my cases involving cooperators who sought witness protection.\n\nIn prison, Vi\u00f1as already had been in witness protection. Judge Garaufis told us it's routine for the same protection to continue after release. But the U.S. Department of Justice witness security program, known as \"WITSEC,\" turned him down with no explanation.\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: They don't give the reasons and the prosecutors moved for reconsideration. Reconsideration was denied.\n\nScott Pelley: The prosecutors work for the Justice Department. The FBI agents are part of the Justice Department. All of them agree that he should be in the witness protection program. And then, another agency inside the Justice Department overrules them?\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: That's what troubles me. That-- they've had 8,700-- at least 8,700-- cooperators placed in witness protection. And I know some of these cooperators. They've been my defendants. I've had virtually the entire Bonanno organized crime family on my docket. I've had many trials involving murderers and drug kingpins on my docket. So I'm not a newcomer to this process. And I was shocked that they took such a cavalier irresponsible step as they did to deny Mr. Vi\u00f1as witness protection.\n\nThe Justice Department's WITSEC office declined an interview. But in a statement to 60 Minutes it hinted at an explanation. It singled out just one of the factors in its decision process. WITSEC \"\u2026must take into account the risks associated with giving a person a new identity and placing them in a community that is unaware of the person's actual identity\u2026\" Judge Garaufis argues that, if Vi\u00f1as does pose a continuing risk to the community, then witness protection would insure that the government kept tabs on him and after all Vi\u00f1as has done, Garaufis says, the Justice Department has an obligation to keep him safe.\n\nScott Pelley: It's extremely rare, Your Honor, in my experience to have a federal judge talk about a case. And I wonder why you have done this today?\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: I've never done it before in 18 years as a judge. I won't allow the folks who made this decision to hide behind their decision. And it's a potential problem in the future.\n\nScott Pelley: This would have a chilling effect, in your opinion, on people who might consider cooperating in the future?\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: That's right.\n\nToday, Bryant Vi\u00f1as is on his own.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: Right now I'm working washing dishes at a restaurant. So that's how I'm paying the bills.\n\nScott Pelley: The greatest al-Qaeda informant of all time, we're told, is washing dishes.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: That's correct.\n\nScott Pelley: You're probably the only dishwasher who lectures at West Point.\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: (Laughter) Yeah.\n\nAfter eight years in prison, cooperating with the government, Vi\u00f1as is still fighting terror. He's spoken at the U.S. Military Academy and to research organizations about the false lure of jihad. And he's still helping investigators.\n\nScott Pelley: Do you consider yourself, as we sit here right now, square with the United States?\n\nBryant Vi\u00f1as: I always feel that it's-- it's a continuing process that I should do for years to come.\n\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis: I don't forgive him for seeking to engage in jihad against the United States. It's not that you forgive him. But he turned a corner. And he was successful in doing it. The government needs to meet\u2014to meet its part of the bargain.\n\nProduced by Robert G.

Lagerfeld confirmed in an interview with Num\u00e9ro last year that she, among others, would be an heiress to his vast fortune. \"Don't worry, there is enough for everyone,\" he said. Among Choupette's most admired traits? \"She doesn't talk,\" Lagerfeld told Numero in an earlier interview.\n\nBefore Lagerfeld's death, Choupette, who has nearly 250,000 followers on Instagram, already had an income, appearing in advertisements for cars and beauty products. She had been named an ambassador for French carmaker Opel, was the subject of two books and had her own line of makeup for Shu Uemura, according to Le Figaro.\n\n\"She has her own little fortune, she is an heiress: If something happens to me, the person who will take care of it will not be in misery,\" Lagerfeld said. \"She's a rich girl!\"\n\nThough Lagerfeld is German, the pair resided in France, where the law prohibits pets from inheriting their owners' wealth. German law, however, allows one's wealth to be transferred to an animal.\n\n\"In France you cannot name a pet as a beneficiary. In order for a beneficiary to receive an inheritance, it has to be a physical person or a foundation,\" said Valerie Duane-Dray, an international inheritance lawyer based in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nShe suspects Lagerfeld took one of three routes to ensure Choupette, which means \"Sweetheart\" in English, would continue to be pampered after the designer's death.\n\nHe could have created a foundation, whose sole mission is to take care of the cat, and named a director who could receive funds under the condition that the money is for the animal's care.\n\nHe could also have donated the money to an existing nonprofit and stipulated that the funds be used to take care of Choupette. Alternatively, he could have left Choupette to a trusted individual along with a gift of cash, earmarked for her care, Duane-Dray said.\n\nIt's not uncommon for pet owners to consider their furry friends in estate planning. \"I have definitely recommended people taking certain steps planning for how their assets pass to make sure they take care of their pets,\" said certified financial planner Roger Ma.\n\nEstate laws in the U.S. vary but always require that a human being have oversight over any funds entrusted to a pet. Courts have discretion, too. \"There are reasonable limits to what you can leave a pet. A court will not honor the request of millions of dollars and can reduce a trust for a pet to what is a reasonable sum,\" said estate planning lawyer Jennifer Guimond-Quigley.\n\nStill, it isn't unheard of for an owner to bequeath a pet money it can't even spend.\n\nBillionaire real estate tycoon Leona Helmsely raised eyebrows in 2007 when she died and left $12 million for her Maltese, named Trouble. German countess Carlotta Liebenstein in 1991 left her dog Gunther IV $80 million, launching him to the top of the \"Pet Rich List.\"\n\nLagerfeld's pet-pampering habits are drawing attention to what Ma said is an important conversation for pet owners to have.\n\n\"Everyone that is a pet owner should make sure not to overlook their furry friends when they're making their estate plans,\" said Ma. \"Not everyone has millions to give their pet, but it shines a light on making sure there's a qualified caretaker that you trust to ensure it has a good home to go to and also that you fund their needs.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wallaces-giant-bee-megachile-pluto-once-thought-extinct-has-been-discovered-alive-on-island-in-indonesia/", "text": "The world's largest bee is a big, black wasp-like insect as long as an adult's thumb, and it was extinct \u2014 or so scientists thought.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, maintains he was the victim of a brutal hate crime in late January. But after a daily array of twists and turns, he became a suspect, and was charged with a felony for allegedly filing a false police report. A judge has set bond and ordered the actor to surrender his passport.\n\nHow did all of this happen?\n\nHere's what went down:\n\nJan. 22: One week before the reported attack, a letter threatening Smollett arrives at the Fox studio where \"Empire\" is filmed. The letter, later published by TMZ, contained a homophobic death threat against Smollett spelled out in cut-up letters. The envelope reads \"MAGA,\" an apparent reference to President Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.\n\nJan. 29: Chicago police open a hate crime investigation after Smollett, 36, says he was attacked near his Chicago apartment. According to police, Smollett says two men approached him around 2 a.m., shouted \"racial and homophobic slurs,\" poured an \"unknown chemical substance\" on him and wrapped a noose around his neck.\n\nPolice confirm to CBS News that in second interview with police, Smollett told detectives his attackers yelled \"This is MAGA country.\"\n\nJan. 30: Chicago police release a photo of two \"persons of interest\" captured on surveillance footage, while noting that the attack itself was not captured.\n\nPhotos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member.

He tears up before the set and tells the crowd, \"Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love.\" A meet-and-greet that was scheduled for the show is canceled, with security concerns cited.\n\nFeb. 4: Chicago police release the initial incident report. It says a friend of Smollett, who reported the incident to police, says Smollett \"did not want to report offense\" but \"believed it to be in the best interest to.\" The report also notes that Smollett still had a rope around his neck when police arrived to interview him. In the report, Smollett says the attackers were wearing black and the \"primary aggressor.\" He says they were wearing a black mask, but he recalls no other \"distinguishing features.\"\n\nFeb. 12: Chicago police say the phone records Smollett gave them were \"heavily redacted\" and \"do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.\"\n\nJussie Smollett seen May 28, 2015, in Los Angeles. Getty\n\nFeb. 14: Smollett appears on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" for his first television interview since the incident. He tears up in the interview and pushes back on those who have questioned his story. He says \"pride\" made him reluctant to initially report the incident, and that he was hesitant to give his phone to police because of private information on it.\n\nIn a statement, Smollett's lawyer say the redactions were \"intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.\"\n\nChicago police say media reports about the attack being a hoax \"are unconfirmed by case detectives. Smollett denies the reports through a spokesperson. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says there is no evidence to support that this was a hoax.\n\nFeb. 15: Chicago police announce they are questioning two \"persons of interest\" who were seen on surveillance video. But later that day, the two men are released without charges. Police say \"new evidence\" has given detectives \"additional investigative work to complete.\"\n\nFeb. 16: A source close to the investigation tells CBS News that two Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, told detectives Smollett paid them to participate in the attack. They say the rope that was found around Smollett's neck was purchased at a nearby hardware store. A raid of their home turned up ropes, masks and bleach.\n\nChicago police say their questioning of the brothers had \"shifted the trajectory of the investigation,\" and they requested another interview with Smollett. The actor's attorneys say he is \"angered and devastated\" by reports that he knew the alleged attackers, and that one of the men was Smollett's personal trainer. Ola Osundairo had played a prisoner in a season of \"Empire.\"\n\nFeb. 17: Chicago police release a vague statement on Twitter: \"While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.\"\n\nFeb. 18: Ola and Abel Osundairo, the two brothers previously questioned by police, speak out publicly for the first time. In a statement to CBS Chicago, the brothers say: \"We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.\"\n\nFeb. 19: The two brothers were talking to prosecutors, sources told CBS News. The brothers spent the afternoon at the Cook County courthouse. It is not clear if they testified, but they are expected to, according to sources. That could lead to an indictment of Smollett.\n\nFeb. 20: The Cook County, Illinois, state attorney files a felony disorderly conduct charge against Smollett for allegedly filing a false report. This is announced soon after Chicago police confirm Smollett is a suspect in a criminal investigation.\n\nSurveillance footage obtained by CBS Chicago shows the Osundairo brothers buying a red hat and ski masks one day before the reported assault.\n\nFeb. 21: Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face charge. A judge sets bond at $100,000 and ordered Smollett to surrender his passport. Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson blasts Smollett at a press conference, saying he is \"offended\" and \"angry\" by the apparent hoax.\n\n\"I'm left hanging my head and asking why,\" Johnson says. \"Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?\"\n\nMarch 8: A Chicago grand jury charged Smollett with 16 felony counts for every alleged lie he told police. Smollett was charged last month with a single felony of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

I've not been afraid to do that,\" Hogan said.\n\nAsked if President Trump is fit to be president, Hogan said, \"Look, I'm not in any position to judge the fitness of the president \u2026 I've been pretty clear, I don't like the tone that the president uses. I think there are times where he acts irrationally, and makes decisions and ... does things in a way that aren't great for the Republican Party, or for the country, or for him and his agenda, for that matter. I mean, I think sometimes he can be his own worst enemy.\"\n\nIn 2016, Hogan was one of the most high-profile Republicans to withhold support for then-candidate Trump's nomination. Little has changed since then for Hogan who said, \"I haven't become more supportive than I was four years ago.\"\n\nHogan also issued a warning of sorts \u2013 what he called \"friendly advice\" \u2013 if Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report were to come back with troubling evidence.\n\n\"I think you would see a number of potential challengers in the Republican Party consider jumping in.\"\n\nHogan is set to take on a far more prominent role in the coming months as head of the National Governors Association.

I'm not saying he couldn't win but he's pretty weak in the general election.\"\n\nIf the president's approval ratings continue to dip heading into the campaign cycle, Hogan said the Republican Party will need to consider what his potential defeat next November could mean for GOP office holders across the country.\n\n\"At some point if he weakens further, Republicans would say we're concerned about whether or not he's going to win if we're going to face a very far-left Democratic nominee, and is he going to take the rest of us down with him if you're an elected official,\" he added.\n\nHogan easily won re-election in November by double digits, defeating former NAACP president Ben Jealous. But attempts by Republicans to win more seats in the state legislature fell short and GOP incumbents lost three key county executive races in part due to statewide opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\nRepublicans opposed to some of Mr. Trump's policies and style of governance have been courting Hogan, a popular two-term Republican governor in a deep-blue state, to launch a White House bid and challenge the president for the GOP nomination.\n\nHogan told CBS News the probability of someone stealing a party's presidential nomination from an incumbent president is very slim. But then, he noted that the odds were also not in his favor when he won two consecutive gubernatorial races in Maryland.\n\n\"I don't know what it's going to look like down the road,\" he said. \"Today it would be very difficult.

But how should you watch this race so early on?\n\nOn this week's episode of \"Where Did You Get This Number?\", CBS News Director of Elections and Surveys Anthony Salvanto and CBS News political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns discuss the dynamics influencing the early presidential polls, particularly looking at how voters are thinking and what they're thinking about.\n\nDemocratic voters are wide open to a potential candidate to run against Donald Trump, unlike in the past when there tended to be someone who was next in line to lead, according to Huey-Burns. She said Democratic voters are thinking less about their own personal bottom lines and using a political science type of structure to assess the candidates.\n\n\"But I think that, at least among Democrats, and I've talked to voters about this, that they feel so upset about the last election that they are concerned about kind of voting with their hearts versus voting with their minds,\" Huey-Burns said.\n\nShe cited her experience at an event for Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Iowa, where even some of Warren's most ardent supporters were asking questions about her electability against President Trump.\n\n\"She does have this constituency that just adores her. I mean, I saw people with 'she persisted' tattoos, and others who had all this Elizabeth Warren memorabilia,\" Huey-Burns said. \"But even those who really loved her did raise the question about, 'Well, can she beat Donald Trump? I'm just not sure.'\"\n\nAnd this open-mindedness among Democratic voters may also help several candidates who aren't as well-known nationally.\n\n\"And that's the other theme I'm sensing in this campaign so far, that there are candidates who are really enjoying status as an underdog,\" Huey-Burns said. \"Because we had seen in the past election, that just because you're polling well, or you're well-known and you're kind of seen as the next in line for the party, doesn't always sit well with voters.\"\n\nAnother trend emerging among Democratic candidates is not taking any corporate political action committee money. Huey-Burns said while grassroots fundraising can help create momentum and therefore garner more donations, there is a limited supply of money, especially given the number of candidates in the field, on top of how expensive it can be to run a campaign.\n\n\"Can these campaigns continue to afford to take this stance?\" Huey-Burns asked.\n\nSubscribe to \"Where Did You Get This Number?\" and download the latest episode to listen to more of their conversation on the story-lines and issues underlying the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nThe podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher, or Spotify.

Kamala Harris, D-California, literally took her message to church as around 1,000 people flooded the pews of the South Street church in Portsmouth like it was Christmas Eve mass.\n\nHarris said Democrats must talk about \"hard truths\" like gun violence, a lack of concern about educating other people's kids, and the lives of immigrants in this country but also that these ideas need to be \"prosecuted\" via a public debate.\n\nAs Harris outlined these \"hard truths,\" her Democratic congregation on Presidents Day regularly rose to their feet to cheer. By the end of her event, Harris had converted many Democrats into believers.\n\nYet, some yearned for a more emotional message, especially those who had previously attended Booker's more intimate events.\n\n\"I really liked Harris' talk, but it felt more performative,\" said Marcos Del Hierro, 37, comparing the event to Booker's which he attended the day before.\n\nHarris showed her go-with-the-flow attitude as she waded into the snowy outdoors to address the hundreds of people who were not able to get into her event.\n\n\"It's amazing!\" Harris reacted as she stepped back inside.\n\nwow: HUNDREDS of ppl standing outside in the snow in NH and @KamalaHarris goes outside to greet them before her event: pic.twitter.com/Svi0HADZan \u2014 Bo Erickson (@BoKnowsNews) February 18, 2019\n\nBeyond stump speeches, candidates differentiated themselves with new policy positions.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, received progressive credit by endorsing a third federal gender identity marker for Americans who identify as non-binary when asked about a similar statewide bill. Booker, meanwhile, took this question, twice, and said he would research.\n\nWATCH: \u201cWhen President Trump demonizes transgender children it breaks my heart,\u201d @SenGillibrand is emotional talking at LGBTQ event in NH.

Booker also was asked and said he would find out more.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, was also in the state and took a centrist stance on two now-popular issues at a CNN televised town hall: Medicare for All she said is a \"possibility in the future\" and underscored that she wanted a more at-the-ready solution for health.\n\n\"No. I am not for free four-year college for all,\" was another definitive assessment of a progressive Democratic idea.\n\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said in an interview with CBS News his staff last week was managing his expectations for turnout at his New Hampshire events due in part to the large number of candidates campaigning nearby.\n\nBut turnout exceeded Buttigieg's expectations and showed up in the hundreds to hear his commitment to \"freedom,\" which he defined as not just idealist but freedom for women's reproduction rights, freedom from crushing loan debt, and access to affordable healthcare.\n\nVoters also mentioned another freedom on display: Marriage. Buttigieg said he introduced his husband at the start of the remarks because his \"marriage is the most important thing in my life\" and he wanted voters to see that.\n\nThe clearest contrast between the candidates came from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, whose platform centers on an anti-war agenda. While the other campaign events were filled with applause, around 150 attendees at her Sunday town hall sat mostly in silence, seemingly entranced by the serious issues of nuclear war she was forecasting.\n\nOne moment of Gabbard-loving applause was significantly different. The first question, came from a man who said, \"I really admire that you met with [Syrian dictator Bashar al] Assad.\" Gabbard controversially met with Assad in secret in June 2017.\n\nMore than half of the attendees, many while wearing Hawaii leis, erupted with clapping joy."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/decrying-socialism-trump-looks-to-solidify-crucial-latino-support-in-florida/", "text": "Decrying what he portrayed as the pitfalls of socialist governance in Latin America, President Trump crafted a not-so-thinly-veiled campaign pitch to the region's diaspora in Florida, a battleground state crucial to his 2020 reelection bid.\n\n\"We are here to proclaim a new day is coming in Latin America,\" the president told a raucous crowd peppered with tricolor Venezuelan flags on Monday. \"In Venezuela and across the Western Hemisphere, socialism is dying and liberty prosperity and democracy are being reborn.\"\n\nAlthough it was not an official campaign event, Mr. Trump's visit to Florida International University's (FIU) Miami campus resembled one of his signature \"Make America Great Again\" rallies. With fiery rebukes of the \"horrors\" of socialism, the president denounced the leftist ruling governments in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba \u2014 which his administration has branded the \"Troika of Tyranny\" \u2014 a departure from the \"America first\" foreign policy views he usually espouses.\n\nDrawing fervent cheers, Mr. Trump touted his administration's tough stance against the increasingly-authoritarian government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, signaling that the ouster of the socialist Venezuelan leader could also facilitate the fall of leftist governments in Cuba and Nicaragua.\n\n\"We reaffirm that solidarity with the long suffering people of Cuba, and Nicaragua, and people everywhere living under socialist and communist regimes,\" Mr. Trump said to a fervent applause. \"And to those who would try to oppose socialism on the United States, we again deliver a very simple message: America will never be a socialist country.\"\n\nPresident Trump speaks about the crisis in Venezuela during a visit to Florida International University in Miami, Fla. Reuters\n\nApart from serving as an implied criticism of new progressive members of Congress who identify as democratic socialists, Brian Fonseca, director of FIU's institute for public policy, said there's a clear electoral strategy behind the president's campus visit and his scathing condemnation of socialism in Venezuela and other Latin American countries.\n\n\"2020 is not very far away,\" Fonseca told CBS News. \"And I suspect this was really about a message for a variety of different stakeholders, certainly a message about U.S. foreign policy to the governments of Cuba, Venezuelan and Nicaragua, but also a message to both constituents and opposition here in the United States.\"\n\n\"Florida is a very important state in the elections. And it's one that the Republicans seem to have a very narrow edge on now. And certainly, the timing of this has everything to do with the national election,\" he added.\n\nThe growing Latin American diaspora in Florida has given Democrats some of hope of solidifying their electoral power in the state in recent years. But, Mr. Trump carried the state in 2016 by nearly 113,000 votes while Republicans won two high-profile Senate and gubernatorial races during the November midterm elections.\n\nThe state's large Cuban-American community \u2014 which has been a loyal GOP voting bloc for decades \u2014 was the only Latino group to back Mr. Trump in 2016, with more than half of Cuban voters casting their ballots for the president, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nFonseca believes the president and other Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario D\u00edaz-Balart are hoping to transform the Venezuela community in the U.S., particularly in south Florida, into a key Republican constituency through an aggressive crackdown on Maduro's regime, in much the same way the GOP was able to woo Cuban exiles through a hardline stance on the communist leadership in Havana.\n\nAlong with recognizing the main opposition leader in Venezuela, National Assembly President Juan Guaid\u00f3, as the country's interim president and issuing sweeping sanctions against the largest state-owned oil company, the Trump administration has pledged more than $20 million in humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan people.\n\nThe White House strategy to court the exiled Venezuelan and Nicaraguan communities \u2014 and maintain the loyalty of the Cuban diaspora \u2014 will make it more challenging for Democrats to win Florida's coveted 24 electoral votes in future elections, Fonseca added.\n\n\"Democrats are going to have an uphill battle for Latinos in the state of Florida going forward,\" he said. \"It's hard for Democrats, in my opinion, to come out and counter a message that's predicated on human rights and humanitarian assistance.\"\n\nFlorida's Democrats, who have enthusiastically backed the administration's policy in Venezuela, understand the president's political strategy and have accused him of trying to exploit a humanitarian crisis for political gain. Rep. Donna Shalala, a freshman Democrat who represents a majority-Latino district in south Florida with a sizable community of Venezuelan exiles, criticized the president for not backing a bipartisan bill to extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Venezuelans in the U.S. during his visit to Miami.\n\n\"I'll reiterate that a path to freedom and democracy for the Venezuelan people has strong bipartisan support in the United States Congress,\" she wrote in a statement. \"This is not a partisan issue, and the Administration must stop approaching it that way.\"\n\nNeither Shalala nor any of other Democratic member of Florida's congressional delegation were invited by the White House to the president's speech Monday, her office told CBS News.\n\nAsked whether the joint White House, GOP campaign strategy will hinder the Democratic Party's electoral infrastructure in Florida, the Democratic National Committee's Hispanic media director Enrique Guti\u00e9rrez told CBS News his party \"supports the Venezuelan people as they demand the right to select their leaders democratically.\"\n\n\"Democrats in Congress are working to ensure that the United States uses all of its economic and political tools to continue supporting the restoration of democracy in Venezuela \u2014 from holding Maduro accountable to funding humanitarian relief to providing Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans fleeing the catastrophic and dangerous conditions in their country,\" Guti\u00e9rrez added.\n\nRegardless of whether the U.S. and the international community succeeds in forcing Maduro to step down, Fonseca believes Venezuelan exiles in America have already recognized the Trump's administration's aggressive rhetoric and policies against Maduro.\n\n\"Either way this goes, I think you'll see that this administration seems to have done more than the previous administrations in taking a hardline approach \u2014 I don't think the Venezuelan diaspora community will forget that,\" he said."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-biden-weighs-a-2020-bid-democratic-voters-are-looking-elsewhere/", "text": "Columbia, S.C. \u2014 Joe Biden leads most Democratic primary polls and is so revered in the party that many voters who have never met him in person refer to him as they would a longtime friend.\n\nBut as he takes his time considering a bid for the White House, Democratic primary voters are getting busy meeting all of the candidates who have already declared. And the energy surrounding this new crop of contenders \u2014 campaign events in South Carolina and New Hampshire over Presidents Day weekend drew thousands \u2014 is making the former vice president appear more like a relic than a real contender in the minds of some Democrats at this early stage of the campaign.\n\nWith one of the largest and most diverse presidential fields the party has seen, voters are already measuring up their \"love for Joe\" against an array of new options.\n\n\"I wish he had done it before. Now he's got a lot of stiff competition,\" said Carl Streeter, a retired Air Force veteran from Goose Creek, South Carolina.\n\nAnd some voters have such an affinity for him that they almost don't want him to run. Many of those enthused by the Democratic primary field feel invested in his legacy and are fearful that the primary process could damage him.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. I just don't know. I would hate for his career and all of that to end on a loss,\" said Kerry Fulton, a Columbia resident. \"And as much as I love him, I think he potentially has baggage that could be twisted and distorted and taken and manufactured into something that can't overcome the Trump machine ... I just hate that his timing way off last time around. I feel that may have been his time.\"\n\nCynthia Stetzer, a retiree from Charleston, said she used to live in New Hampshire and voted for Biden during his previous attempts at the presidency. \"I have always supported Joe Biden. And I still like him very, very much. I think his time is, I think it's over ... I think he has a lot to offer to the [eventual] candidate and to the Democratic Party.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, where five contenders campaigned there simultaneously over the weekend, many Democrats who began to shop for a candidate said they also wanted Biden to stay out of the contest.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden!\" Cathy Woolf shouted above the music before an event for Sen. Cory Booker in Portsmouth. As a former Delaware resident, she appreciated his commitment to public service but for her, it seems like Biden feels like he has a \"right to the presidency.\"\n\n\"I love Joe,\" was a common refrain among voters in the Palmetto State, where he has had particularly deep ties, and in the Granite State where he has run for president twice before. And it helps explain why he leads the field in public polling at this stage.\n\n\"Very early polls, to a great extent, measure name ID and familiarity \u2014 which the former VP obviously has \u2014 along with voters' impressions of a figure if they have one,\" says Anthony Salvanto, director of CBS News Elections and Surveys. \"And of course Joe Biden served in a presidential administration of which Democrats strongly approved.\"\n\nBut even those who see him as still formidable say he needs to make a decision soon.\n\n\"I do believe the window is narrowing,\" said Jennifer Clyburn-Reed, the daughter of Rep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina kingmaker. Clyburn-Reed likened the Democratic field to a buffet.\n\n\"Just personally, if you're going to run let's get in here so we can see our choices,\" she said. \"Don't bring out the macaroni and cheese after all the main dishes are gone. I would really like to see my meal all out at once, so we can go and dabble in all the dishes, and see what it is that we want to make our main course.\"\n\nStrategists say the diversity of the field and the amount of choices is attractive to Democratic voters. \"The challenge for Joe is to maintain his popularity among potential Democratic voters,\" says South Carolina Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright. \"When you go from being known as being America's uncle to a candidate in the Democratic primary, the ballgame changes.\"\n\nBiden \"has to understand the more people meet the candidates and the more they learn about them, the more likely they could be turned off the the idea of Biden running,\" Seawright says.\n\nBernice Scott, a long time Columbia-based Democratic activist, said she gathered a group of women at her house over the weekend to talk about the campaign and take an early temperature reading. \"They say he's done well, they love him and they want to do a change from the 'white male syndrome,'\" said Scott, whose granddaughter, Jalissa Washington-Price, is Kamala Harris' deputy national political director.\n\n\"The white male syndrome\" also came up frequently in New Hampshire \u2014 \"no more old, white males,\" Democratic voters said over and over again when asked about Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nEven some older white men think it is time for young blood. \"Frankly, I don't want to see an elderly president come into office,\" former U.S. Amb. George Bruno, a long time New Hampshire campaign liaison, said. \"In fact I don't think it would be wise to elect a president that is over 70.\" Biden, meanwhile, will turn 77 this year.\n\nBiden's presence will still remain as other Democrats try to pick out their favorite aspects of \"Joe\" in other candidates.\n\nProgressive Concord talk radio host and former gubernatorial candidate Arnie Arnesen gushed over two other Democrats: South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who she saw in New Hampshire campaigning this weekend, and Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. She said they both are \"serious but charming\" with Midwest credentials and have a \"very sober\" position on \"Healthcare-for-All.\"\n\n\"I love Joe, I know Joe. I knew him in the first campaign and the second campaign Biden has a lot of issues. Biden is too attached to Wall Street. Biden has the Anita Hill problem.\"\n\nPut more simply: \"These two people have a lot of the strengths of Biden but none of the s\u2014t,\" Arneson said.\n\nOthers pointed to the folksiness of former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas as someone who fits the Biden mold.\n\n\"Some people are loyal and really want Biden,\" says Scott, the South Carolina based activist. \"If all the other people weren't running, Biden would be it.\"\n\nFor those Biden loyalists, like New Hampshire resident Maureen Brennan, no one can replace him.\n\n\"I'm 75,\" Brennan giggled when asked her age. \"Now you see why the Joe Biden [support].\"\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story mistakenly referred to Amb.

Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, announced Tuesday he is launching a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, hoping to reignite the ardent progressive support of his insurgent 2016 campaign.\n\n\"We're gonna win,\" he told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host John Dickerson. In his second run, Sanders is vowing to launch a grassroots movement that will \"lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country.\"\n\nHe stressed that the chief priority for Democrats is to thwart President Trump's reelection bid next year. \"It is absolutely imperative that Donald Trump be defeated, because I think it is unacceptable and un-American, to be frank with you, that we have a president who is a pathological liar,\" Sanders said during a wide-ranging interview in his home in Vermont.\n\n\"We have a president who is a racist, who is a sexist, who is a xenophobe, who is doing what no president in our lifetimes has come close to do doing, and that is trying to divide us up,\" he added.\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders announces 2020 run: Extended interview\n\nBy joining the most diverse Democratic primary field in U.S. history, the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist will face more difficulty billing himself as the standard-bearer of the Democratic Party's progressive wing this time around. In 2016, Sanders mounted a forceful but ultimately unsuccessful challenge against establishment candidate and eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, prompting her to move to the left on several key issues.\n\nBut the three-term senator is now entering a field already crowded with several high-profile candidates \u2014 including five other senators \u2014 but no clear favorite. Candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have already begun highlighting their progressive bona fides on the campaign trail, throwing their support behind bold proposals like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal while touting a tough stance on Wall Street.\n\nSo far, nearly a dozen Democrats have declared their candidacy for president or launched presidential exploratory committees, including senators Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar; Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard; and former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. Several others, like former Vice President Joe Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, are also mulling bids for the Democratic nomination.\n\nSanders said he will again campaign on progressive policies like raising the minimum wage, universal healthcare and tuition-free public higher education, making them fundamental issues of his second White House bid. The Vermont lawmaker took credit for the support that these policies, once considered fringe proposals, have garnered among rank-and-file Democrats.\n\n\"All of those ideas people were saying, 'Oh Bernie, they're so radical. They are extreme. The American people just won't accept those ideas.' Well, you know what's happened in over three years? All of those ideas and many more are now part of the political mainstream,\" he said.\n\nDickerson also asked Sanders about former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who has said he's mulling an independent White House run but might drop it if Democrats choose a moderate, rather than a progressive, to take on the president. Sanders dismissed Schultz as a billionaire who's essentially \"blackmailing the Democratic Party.\"\n\n\"If you don't nominate Bernie Sanders he's not gonna run?\" Sanders said of Schultz. \"Well, I don't think we should succumb to that kind of blackmail.\"\n\nDickerson pointed out that Schultz represents the argument that Democrats, in order to win voters in more conservative parts of the country, have to pick a candidate who isn't as radical.\n\n\"I think his deeper theory is, 'Hey, I'm a billionaire. Leave me alone. And let me make as much as money as I can without paying my fair share of taxes,'\" Sanders countered, without acknowledging the point.\n\nIn the 2020 campaign cycle, Sanders can expect to confront some of the same hurdles that hindered his 2016 campaign, including his struggle to galvanize minority voters and his insistence on identifying as an independent and not as a Democrat.\n\nSanders garnered more than 13 million primary votes and carried 23 states during the Democratic primaries by energizing a movement of young voters with his fiery populist rhetoric. But he consistently underperformed among African-American and Latino voters and suffered humbling defeats to Clinton in diverse states, like California and South Carolina.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump's stunning victory two years ago, many Democrats, including Clinton herself, criticized Sanders for what they believed was his tepid support for Clinton, and for the tenor of his primary campaign. In her book What Happened, Clinton said \"[Sanders'] attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump's 'Crooked Hillary' campaign.\"\n\nDuring the interview with CBS News, Sanders downplayed the criticism he has received for not running as a Democrat in Congress, saying he's caucused with congressional Democrats for decades. But he added that a growing number of Americans are dissatisfied with both Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\"If the Democratic party is going to do well in the future, I think they have to reach out to those independents, including, by the way, a lot of young people, a lot of people of color, and bring them into the Democratic Party. And I think I'm in a good position to do that,\" he said.\n\nRecently, Sanders has also been forced to address allegations from several female staff members of his 2016 campaign who say they were harassed. In a public apology last month, he denounced sexism and said the women's experiences were not part of \"what a progressive campaign, or any campaign, should be about.\"\n\nSanders has also met with some of the women from his 2016 campaign who said they experienced harassment and felt discriminated against. Dickerson asked him what he learned from them.\n\n\"I learned that that was true. And, it \u2026 breaks my heart,\" he said. His campaign, Sanders recalled, \"kind of exploded,\" rapidly expanding from \"a few\" to \"a lot\" of staffers. \"And I will be very honest in telling you that, in retrospect, some of the people that were hired should not have been hired, and some women went through experiences that they should not have,\" he told Dickerson.\n\n\"This has been an issue that has upset me and we're gonna rectify it in this campaign,\" Sanders said, pledging to implement the \"strongest protocols\" to protect women and other staff members working in his new campaign from harassment.\n\nThe president's 2020 campaign quickly slammed Sanders' announcement, accusing him of having an unpopular and fringe agenda.\n\n\"Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism,\" Kayleigh McEnany, the campaign's national press secretary, wrote in a statement Tuesday. \"But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela.\"\n\nSince Mr. Trump's election, the Vermont senator has joined his Democratic colleagues in opposing most of the president's Cabinet and Supreme Court nominees and his policies on immigration, climate change and the tax system. Sanders has called the president a \"pathological liar\" and vowed to defeat \"Trumpism and the Republican right-wing ideology.\"\n\nIn 2017, his \"Medicare for All\" legislation was backed by 16 Senate Democrats, including most of the ones who have launched White House bids. Sanders, who has been outspoken in his criticism of U.S. military interventions abroad and has advocated for defense cuts, spearheaded a resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition waging a bloody war in Yemen that passed in the Senate in December.\n\nBefore his election to the Senate in 2006, Sanders represented Vermont's at-large congressional district in the House for 16 years. He has made universal healthcare, tuition-free college education and efforts to combat income inequality integral themes of his legislative agenda. Sanders also opposed the 1991 and 2002 resolutions to authorize military engagement in Iraq.\n\nPrior to his tenure in Congress, Sanders served as mayor of Burlington, Vermont for three terms. As a politically active college student at the University of Chicago during the 1960s, he was involved in the civil rights movement.\n\nSanders, the son of Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe, was born and raised in Brooklyn."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-2020-democratic-candidate-sets-sights-on-south-carolina-in-first-campaign-swing/", "text": "Columbia, S.C. \u2014 Democrat Kamala Harris represents California in the Senate, but her inaugural campaign swing through South Carolina over the weekend sent a clear signal that she sees the Palmetto State as the gateway to winning her party's nomination for president.\n\nWith its prime spot in the 2020 calendar and its high concentration of African American voters, the South Carolina primary could provide a launching pad for Democratic presidential hopefuls. And Harris' \"truth and justice\" campaign pitch seemed tailormade for competing in the state, which is scheduled to hold its primary on Feb. 29, 2020.\n\nOver the course of two town halls in North Charleston and Columbia \u2014 which book-ended stops through small businesses owned by black women, lunch at Rodney Scott's BBQ and a visit to Emanuel AME, the historically black church where nine worshipers were gunned down in 2015 \u2014 Harris advocated for changes to the criminal justice and education systems and the nation's gun laws, while touting bail reform legislation and an anti-lynching bill she co-authored in the Senate.

But that same experience also presents liabilities for Harris in the Democratic primary, with her record as district attorney in San Francisco and as attorney general of California already coming under scrutiny and attacks from some progressives.\n\nHarris touted a re-entry program designed to reduce recidivism known as \"Back on Track\" from her time as district attorney. \"I tried to explain to them the concept of redemption ... Isn't it a sign of a civil society that you allow people to earn your way back?\" she recalled of the 2005 initiative. She referenced her push for anti-bias training for police officers, California's \"Open Justice\" data sharing program and her work in the Senate with Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky to reform the bail system they view as discriminatory.\n\nBut critics argue her record of action on criminal justice is mixed and at times at odds with the cause of social justice and anti-discrimination. As attorney general from 2011 to 2017, Harris declined to support a measure that would have required her office to independently investigate shootings by police officers, and didn't weigh in on a ballot initiative to reduce low-level criminal sentences. She defended the death penalty in her role as the state's top law enforcement officer, even though she personally opposed it. And she established a strict anti-truancy program that was seen as punishing parents.\n\nSen.

But I will also say that there is so much more work to do. And do I wish I could have done more? Absolutely.\"\n\nBeyond criminal justice, Harris spoke about other national issues with particular relevance in South Carolina, including climate change and offshore drilling, teacher pay and middle class wages.\n\n\"The economy isn't working for working people,\" Harris said repeatedly throughout her stops here. Political leaders are engaging in \"science fiction instead of science fact,\" was another line of her stump speech. \"I have met teachers who are working three jobs to put food on the table and pay the bills,\" she told the audience in Columbia, as the state legislature debates a public school teacher wage increase.\n\nAt other moments, Harris was light on specifics. When asked by a questioner at the town hall in Columbia how she can \"square the circle\" of supporting Medicare for All and the Green New Deal resolution at a time of rising national debt, Harris replied, \"Our opponents will have you believe it's all about doling out money. It's about an investment.\" On the Green New Deal, Harris said, \"I support the goals, and we're going to have to figure out a way to get there ...

Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat who endorsed Harris on Friday, to scale back the state's high-speed rail plan, the senator she had not had the chance to talk to him about the choice.

We're desperate,\" said one woman who asked Harris how she sets herself apart from the growing pack of contenders.\n\nHarris gave a generic answer about there being so much \"at stake,\" before settling on her pitch to be the \"fighter on the stage who knows how to fight.

Elizabeth Warren officially launched her presidential campaign Saturday morning, over a month after she announced an exploratory committee to test the viability of a bid for the White House.\n\nThe rally for Warren's announcement took place in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the site of a 1912 strike by textile workers, making it a symbolic location to launch a campaign largely focused on economic inequality.\n\nWarren was introduced by a few members of Congress who also endorsed her, including Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who was a student of Warren when she was a professor at Harvard University.\n\nWarren introduced her campaign by telling the story of Lawrence, where laborers -- many of whom were immigrants -- toiled under terrible working conditions. She framed the 1912 walkout by women textile workers as a blueprint for her campaign, one focused on economic inequality.\n\n\"These workers \u2013 led by women \u2013 didn't have much. Not even a common language. Nevertheless, they persisted,\" she said about the strike, using one of her iconic campaign phrases to applause.\n\n\"Hard-working people are up against a small group that holds far too much power, not just in our economy, but also in our democracy. Like the women of Lawrence, we are here to say enough is enough!\" Warren said. She said that President Trump was a \"symptom of what's gone wrong in America,\" meaning a \"rigged system that props up the rich and the powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else.\"\n\n\"This is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way,\" Warren said. \"And that is why I stand here today: to declare that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America.\"\n\nWarren incorporated systemic racial inequality into her message of fighting economic inequality, saying that \"race matters\" when discussing issues such as housing prices and criminal justice.\n\n\"We can't be blind to the fact that the rules in our country have been rigged against other people for a long time \u2013 women, LGBTQ Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, immigrants, people with disabilities \u2013 and we need to call it out,\" she said. \"The rules of our economy have gotten rigged so far in favor of the rich and powerful that everyone else is at risk of being left behind.\"\n\nShe said that her three priorities were to end corruption in Washington, change the rules in our economy and strengthen democracy by enacting voting rights laws. She also discussed top progressive issues like her support for Medicare-for-All and combating climate change, and promised not to receive donations from super PACs or federal lobbyists, challenging every other candidate to do so as well.\n\n\"I will never give up on you and your future. I will never give up on your children and their future. I am in this fight all the way,\" Warren said at the end of the speech. \"It's a long way to election day. But our fight starts here. And it starts with you.\"\n\nShe left the stage to the Aretha Franklin song \"Respect.\"\n\nWarren's nascent campaign has been plagued with controversy over a DNA test she took in the fall to show that she has some Native American heritage. President Trump has often taunted Warren, dubbing her \"Pocahontas\" to mock her heritage claims. To announce the results of the DNA test, Warren used a campaign-style video that tried to directly address questions about her background.\n\nThe Cherokee Nation criticized Warren's announcement last year, saying her use of a DNA test is \"useless\" for determining tribal citizenship and that using DNA analysis to determine connection to any tribal nation is \"inappropriate and wrong.\" Warren apologized to leaders of the Cherokee Nation earlier this month.\n\nWarren also apologized Wednesday afternoon for claiming she was of \"American Indian\" origin in a Texas Bar registration card from 1986. Warren said she wrote that based on stories her family told about their heritage.\n\nThe Trump campaign released a statement about Warren's candidacy on Saturday, calling her a \"fraud.\"\n\n\"The American people will reject her dishonest campaign and socialist ideas like the Green New Deal, that will raise taxes, kill jobs and crush America's middle-class,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \"Only under President Trump's leadership will America continue to grow safer, secure and more prosperous.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that I extended confusion about tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty and for harm caused I am also sorry for not being more mindful of this decades ago tribes and only tribes determine tribal citizenship,\" Warren told reporters.\n\nWhile Warren represents Massachusetts, she was born and raised in Oklahoma, attended college in New Jersey, and taught at law schools in Texas and Pennsylvania before teaching at Harvard. She is a staunch consumer advocate who played a key role in the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration.\n\nWarren was the third senator to officially launch her campaign, after Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has also announced an exploratory committee. Senators Bernie Sanders, Sherrod Brown and Amy Klobuchar are also publicly mulling presidential bids.\n\nEd O'Keefe and Jack Turman contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-apologizes-for-claiming-native-american-heritage/", "text": "Sen.

Elizabeth Warren arrives for the State of the Union address at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 5, 2019. Getty\n\nWarren apologized to leaders of the Cherokee Nation earlier this month. The Cherokee Nation criticized Warren's announcement, saying her use of a DNA test is \"useless\" for determining tribal citizenship and that using DNA analysis to determine connection to any tribal nation is \"inappropriate and wrong.\"\n\nWarren released the results of the analysis in October in response to President Trump's frequent mocking of Warren's ancestry claims and derisive references to her as \"Pocahontas.\" At a debate with her Republican opponent in her Senate race in October, she said she took a DNA test and posted a video about it because she believes one way to rebuild trust in government is by posting her full family history online \"so anybody can take a look. ... I believe one way that we try to rebuild confidence is through transparency.\"\n\nHowever, her apology is unlikely to end criticism of Warren's references to her heritage. Mr. Trump has referred to Warren as Pocahontas for years, going so far as to offer $1 million to a charity of her choice if she took a DNA test that proved her claims at a rally in July. But Mr. Trump denied ever saying that in an interaction with reporters in October.\n\nAsked about his comments by a reporter back then, Mr. Trump said he would only do so if she won the Democratic nomination and if he could administer the DNA test personally.\n\n\"You mean if she gets the nomination, in the debate where I was going to have her tested? I'll only do it if I can test her personally. That will not be something I enjoy doing either,\" the president said."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/22119-red-and-blue/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/north-carolina-district-to-hold-new-election-after-fraud-scandal/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/jared-kushner-looks-at-changes-to-legal-immigration-system/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-says-new-attorney-general-william-barr-will-decide-fate-of-mueller-report/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/22019-red-and-blue/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2019-oscars-91st-academy-awards-new-round-of-presenters-announced-today-2019-02-19/", "text": "Michael B.

She was buying actual books, with actual pages. (Tablets aren't her thing.)\n\n\"Every weekend, we try to go to a bookstore,\" she said. \"Yeah, my husband's really good at it. I don't know, I need a real book, I need a tangible book.\"\n\nBook are great, but she enjoys studying people even more.\n\nCorrespondent Lee Cowan said, \"I've read somewhere that you have a real obsession with observing people who really just don't care \u2013 they don't care what they look like, they don't care what they say, they don't care what they eat, drink, whatever. It's almost like a hobby for you.\"\n\n\"It is a hobby. And it's gotten harder since I am a little more recognizable. My husband, many times, has been like, 'You cannot follow people!' Now you get caught more.\"\n\n\"And would some of those characters that you would stalk...\"\n\n\"Lovingly admire!\" she corrected.\n\nCorrespondent Lee Cowan with actress Melissa McCarthy, at the Iliad Bookshop in North Hollywood, Calif. CBS News\n\n\"Would they make it into some of your other characters? Like, parts of them?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I think when I really see, like, a mannerism or just a way somebody carries themselves, I tend to keep playing it over and over.\"\n\nMcCarthy's characters, as cringe-worthy as they are lovable, are her collection of the bits and pieces of the people she's gathered along the way.\n\nBut for all her outrageous hilarity, McCarthy's is capable of some Oscar-worthy subtlety, too \u2013 a skill she shows off in her latest performance in \"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\"\n\nMcCarthy is up for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Lee Israel. It's the true story of a caustic bestselling biographer who in her later years typed her way into a life of petty crime.\n\n\"Within the first 15 pages of the script, I just thought, oh, I like her quite a bit, I'm not sure why,\" McCarthy said. \"And I thought, I don't know, but I'm fully rooting for her already.\"\n\nIsrael made a name for herself writing profiles of people like actress Tallulah Bankhead, and gossip columnist Dorothy Kilgallen. But when her biography of make-up mogul Estee Lauder flopped, Israel found herself on welfare, and began fabricating letters from celebrities like Louise Brooks, Edna Ferber and Noel Coward \u2013 and then scammed New York City booksellers into buying them as the genuine article.\n\nCowan asked, \"How many of her letters do you think are still out there?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But God, I'd love to know,' McCarthy replied. \"I think there's quite a bit of them hanging on people's walls, proudly, and no, maybe even strangely, it's like it could make them even a little better! It's like a story within a story.\"\n\nOver the course of three years Israel carefully crafted more than 400 fakes, making her one of the most prolific literary forgers in history.\n\n\"She did do some damage to the literary community, even though she didn't see it that way,\" said Cowan.\n\n\"No, she didn't, and I guess I don't,\" said McCarthy. \"I mean, I'm clearly on her side. She grifted people; I'm not saying it's okay what she did. But It's the gentlest grift I've ever heard of. People got conned and I don't take that lightly, but also she was in absolute desperation.\"\n\nYou'd never know it from her writing, though, which was desperately good. Take this letter Israel claimed was written by satirist Dorothy Parker:\n\n\"I have a hangover that is a real museum piece. I'm sure I must have said something terrible. To save me this kind of exertion in the future, I am thinking of having little letters run off saying 'Can you ever forgive me? Dorothy.' But until I do that, can you ever forgive me? Dorothy.\"\n\n\"Such an incredible writer, and so witty,\" McCarthy said. \"She was conjuring these lines, and these incredibly funny replies, and she was really, really good.\"\n\nAnd so was McCarthy's performance, if you go by the award recognition. In addition to her Oscar nod, she was also nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe, all for a pretty dark role that some see as far different from her comedic bread and butter.\n\nBut, she says, \"There's no difference, for me, in preparation, [between] a comedic role or a dramatic role. I still think you build them the same way, and even with all the comedies I've done, I spend more time thinking about what makes them scared or when they feel vulnerable than I ever do about, like, what makes them funny.\"\n\nIn fact, in the '90s, after a stint of doing standup in New York clubs, McCarthy actually found drama a refuge. \"I really did all dramatic work on stage in New York for years and years, way off-Broadway,\" she said.\n\n\"And you said some of them were pretty grim?\"\n\n\"They were pretty grim!\" she laughed. \"You mean, the theaters?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Or even the plays themselves.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was like, the darker, the more macabre I could do, the more I just loved it. I mean, the interest was and is always someone who's much further from myself.\"\n\nLee Israel is light years away from the \"Midwest nice\" of McCarthy. She was an alcoholic, big city porcupine who died largely alone in 2014, after finally writing her own memoir detailing the gritty details of her literary larceny.\n\nCowan said, \"At the end of the day, you read the book and she's not contrite, really, about what she did. She actually sounds like she's kinda bragging about it.\"\n\n\"She never, ever took back [that] the writing was good,\" McCarthy said. \"Someone just recently sent me a letter that she'd written, and she mentions this: 'I've gotten myself into a bit of trouble with some writing.' And then there's some line after it basically saying, 'However, the writing was good and the letters are great.'\"\n\nMcCarthy doesn't excuse Israel's crimes. But she hopes the movie might serve as a reminder that there is talent in all of us, and that even those who are unlikable, maybe even criminal, want what we all do \u2013 to be seen.\n\n\"I just want people to look up and notice people,\" she said. \"I feel like we're so separate now, and I do think all the time, look up, anyone, you don't know who's passing you. You could be passing Lee Israel who is sure to gonna be more interesting and smarter and funnier than the average person. So, like, don't underestimate people.\"\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Aria Shavelson."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/download-oscar-ballot-for-your-office-pool-or-party-2019/", "text": "Planning an Academy Award office pool, or an Oscar-watching party?

The last time the Oscars went without an emcee was 30 years ago.\n\nBurke confirmed the decision during the executive session at the Television Critics Association press tour, ET Online reports, and said the decision was \"wisely\" made by Oscar producers. She also mentioned that a \"lack of clarity\" over the ceremony kept the Oscars in the headlines.\n\n\"Ironically, the lack of clarity surrounding the Oscars has kept the Oscars really in the conversation and the mystery has been compelling. People really care,\" Burke said. \"It's fascinating. We're going to see a big turnout for this because these are big, popular movies who are being nominated. People really care to see who is going to win.\"\n\nBurke addressed the fallout over Kevin Hart quickly exiting the hosting gig in December after old homophobic tweets resurfaced. The 39-year-old comedian eventually apologized to the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year's Oscars,\" Hart tweeted at the time. \"This is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.\"\n\nReports had been swirling for weeks that the Oscars wouldn't have a host for its Feb. 24 ceremony, as Burke affirmed in her remarks Tuesday.\n\n\"There wasn't messiness beyond the Kevin Hart situation. After that, it was pretty clear that we were going to stay the course. There was an idea that they were going to have the presenters just host the Oscars,\" Burke said. \"We all got on board with that. The main goal, which I was told, was the Academy promised ABC last year after a very lengthy telecast to keep the show to three hours. Producers wisely decided to not to have a host and to go back to having the presenters and movies be the stars, and that be the best way to keep the show at a brisk three hours.\"\n\n\"Roma\" and \"The Favourite\" lead in Oscar nominations\n\nThere is a \"phenomenal\" line-up of presenters planned for this year's show, Burke added, including Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Evans, Tina Fey, and Daniel Craig, among others. A bevy of box office hits in the best picture category are in the running for Oscar gold, including \"Black Panther,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"A Star Is Born.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether those popular titles will help boost the show's ratings. The Associated Press said the 2018 telecast had a record-low 26.5 million viewers, which was a 20 percent drop from 2017's Oscars. It was the first time ratings slumped below 30 million, according to Nielsen records dating back to 1974. For comparison, Super Bowl LIII, which aired Sunday on CBS, attracted some 100.7 million people on television and streaming services."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscar-snubs-surprises-emily-blunt-michael-b-jordan-miss-out-on-academy-award-nominations/", "text": "Giving two award-worthy performances in one year is no guarantee that you will make it to the Academy Awards for either of them. Proving that to be the case this year is Emily Blunt, who starred in \"Mary Poppins Returns\" and \"A Quiet Place,\" both of which earned her Screen Actors Guild nods, and neither of which were among the performances mentioned at this morning's announcement of nominations for the 91st annual Academy Awards.\n\n(And it wasn't the first time; despite six career Golden Globe nominations and wins, Blunt has yet to be nominated for an Oscar.)\n\nWhile there were some pleasant surprises among the nominees \u2013 \"Black Panther,\" for example, was the rare superhero film to get any respect from the Academy, let alone a nomination for Best Picture \u2013 there were also some notable omissions, not least of which was Michael B. Jordan, so memorable as the villain Killmonger in \"Black Panther.\" And while the film earned well-deserved nominations for production design, music, and especially costumes, it was stiffed in the area of makeup and hair, which is crazy.\n\nWith the abundance of impressive performances among both actors and actresses this year, it is hard to carp that someone was left out, but carp we will, because the Best Actor category is missing John David Washington (\"BlacKkKlansman\"), Joaquin Phoenix (\"You Were Never Really Here\"), Ben Foster (\"Leave No Trace\"), Ethan Hawke (\"First Reformed\"), Ryan Gosling (\"First Man\"), Robert Redford (\"The Old Man and the Gun\") and Lucas Hedges (\"Boy Erased\").\n\nThe Best Actress category was even more competitive this year, which means that beyond the five women nominated there was no room to recognize Toni Collette (\"Hereditary\"), Joanna Kulig (\"Cold War\"), Carey Mulligan (\"Wildlife\"), Regina Hall (\"Support the Girls\"), Viola Davis (\"Widows\"), Nicole Kidman (\"Destroyer\"), Saoirse Ronan (\"Mary Queen of Scots\"), Elsie Fisher (\"Eighth Grade\"), Natalie Portman (\"Annihilation\"), Chloe Grace Moretz (\"The Miseducation of Cameron Post\"), Rachel Weisz (\"Disobedience\"), and Helena Howard (\"Madeline's Madeline\").\n\nThe slate of Supporting Actor and Actress nominees somewhat matched earlier lists from the Golden Globes and SAG Awards, yet Margot Robbie (\"Mary Queen of Scots\") is missing, as is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (\"Beautiful Boy\"). Also missing: among the ladies, Zoe Kazan (\"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\"), Thomasin McKenzie (\"Leave No Trace\"), Rachel McAdams (\"Disobedience\"), Claire Foy (\"First Man\"), Nicole Kidman (\"Boy Erased\"), Michelle Yeoh (\"Crazy Rich Asians\"), and Jennifer Jason Leigh (\"Annihilation\"); and among the men: Steve Buscemi and Simon Russell Beale (\"The Death of Stalin\"), Jonathan Pryce (\"The Wife\"), Hugh Grant (\"Paddington 2\"), Steven Yeun (\"Burning\"), Jake Gyllenhaal (\"Wildlife\"), Tim Blake Nelson and Tom Waits (\"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\"), and Raul Castillo (\"We the Animals\").\n\nThe Best Picture nominee lineup (\"Black Panther,\" \"BlacKKKlansman,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" \"The Favourite,\" \"Green Book,\" \"Roma,\" \"A Star Is Born\" and \"Vice\") is decent, but missed out on honoring \"The Death of Stalin,\" \"Leave No Trace,\" \"Cold War,\" \"You Were Never Really Here,\" \"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,\" \"At Eternity's Gate,\" \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" \"First Man,\" \"First Reformed,\" \"If Beale Street Could Talk,\" \"Mary Poppins Returns,\" \"The Rider,\" or \"Sorry to Bother You.\"\n\nThe Best Director category is always slightly odd, as there is only room for five nominees while this year there are eight Best Picture nominees. A happy surprise was the inclusion of \"Cold War\" director Pawel Pawlikowski. Yet missing from the lineup were Best Picture-nominated directors Bradley Cooper (\"A Star Is Born\"), Peter Farrelly (\"Green Book\") and Ryan Coogler (\"Black Panther\"), as well as Armando Iannucci (\"The Death of Stalin\"), Debra Granik (\"Leave No Trace\"), Lynne Ramsay (\"You Were Never Really Here\"), Bo Burnham (\"Eighth Grade\"), Alex Garland (\"Annihilation\"), Barry Jenkins (\"If Beale Street Could Talk\"), Joel and Ethan Coen (\"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\"), Chloe Zhao (\"The Rider\"), and Boots Riley (\"Sorry to Bother You\").\n\nThe greatest omission from the screenplay categories is \"The Death of Stalin,\" the funniest film of the year.\n\nIn the technical categories, it was great to see cinematographer Lukasz Zal nominated for the Polish film \"Cold War\" (one of three foreign language films recognized, and one of two shot in black-and-white). But missing was Ashley Connor for \"Madeline's Madeline,\" Beno\u00eet Delhomme for \"At Eternity's Gate,\" Joshua James Richards for \"The Rider,\" Bruno Delbonnel for \"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,\" Newton Thomas Sigel for \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" and James Laxton for \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\"\n\nAnd in the documentary feature category, where the heck are the Mister Rogers doc \"Won't You Be My Neighbor\" and \"Shirkers\"?\n\nFinally, a shout-out to the work of Tatiana Lisovskaya, who composed a dissonant and gut-wrenchingly beautiful piano and violin score for the Vincent Van Gogh biopic \"At Eternity's Gate,\" which wasn't even included in the Academy's shortlist for Best Original Score, which proved short-sighted.\n\nThe 91st Academy Awards will be presented Sunday, Feb. 24."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-oscar-nominations-live-announced-today-2019-01-22-live-stream-updates/", "text": "Hickenlooper: \"The sooner the better\" on Afghanistan pullout\n\n\"A war that's been going on for 17 years and that we see no indication of victory -- you've got to look at different routes and different solutions,\" he told \"CBS This Morning\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2019-oscars-black-panther-first-superhero-movie-nominations-academy-awards-ryan-coogler-today/", "text": "\"Black Panther,\" which struck a cultural chord for having a predominantly black cast, is now an Oscar nominee for best picture, making it the first comic book adaptation to be recognized for the category by the Academy.

After realizing she was gifted but non-verbal, Moss' parents took her to the doctor, where they found out she was on the autism spectrum.\n\nBy the age of 4, the girl from South Florida began speaking and quickly went from special education classes to what mainstream classrooms. She always had her sights set on proving her ability was far greater than her disability.\n\n\"I first shared my story at a conference when I was 13 years old,\" Moss, now 24, told CBS News. \"I've always enjoyed getting to connect and share.\"\n\nShe wrote her first book, \"Middle School \u2014 The Stuff Nobody Tells You About: A Teenage Girl with ASD Shares Her Experiences,\" when she was just 15 years old. Over the past decade, she wrote another book and contributed to a book of essays. Moss has also held several speaking engagements and has created countless pieces of art.\n\nShe said advocating for others with autism has always been important to her. \"I've always been raised to give back and help others in need and help the community,\" she said. \"It takes a village to raise a child, and it takes an even bigger village to raise a child with a disability ... I realized by sharing my story, I could be a part of someone else's village.\"\n\nWhen she received her bachelor's degree from the University of Florida, Moss decided to continue her education \u2014 and advocacy \u2014 and she enrolled at University of Miami School of Law.\n\n\"I wanted to go to law school because I wanted to make a difference for other people,\" she said. \"Lawyers help their community.

Marra stopped short of invalidating the non-prosecution agreement but asked prosecutors and victims' lawyers to recommend in 15 days how to move forward.\n\nThe 66-year-old Epstein reached the deal in 2008 with then-Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta's office to end the federal probe. Epstein instead pleaded guilty to state charges, spent 13 months in jail, paid settlements to victims and is a registered sex offender.\n\nAcosta, now President Trump's labor secretary, has defended the deal as appropriate given what prosecutors knew and could prove at the time, especially with many victims reluctant to testify.

Right now the nomenclature used for the technology is mostly marketing fuzz, and all four major mobile carriers in the U.S. are squabbling about the definition of \"real\" 5G.\n\nIn preparation for broad deployment, every major data carrier in the U.S. is actively marketing 5G. Verizon launched a campaign called 5G Home, an internet service that runs on Verizon's network. AT&T recently rolled out a campaign touting a data network the carrier calls \"5G Evolution,\" a rebranding of LTE technology. Sprint promptly sued AT&T and claimed the carrier was misleading customers about what qualifies as 5G. T-Mobile enlisted physicist Michio Kaku to help the company promote their \"5G for everyone\" marketing campaign. (Kaku is also a CBS News contributor; he was not involved in this story.)\n\nThe economic potential of 5G is so significant President Trump tweeted, \"I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard. American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind.\"\n\nI want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible.

There is no reason that we should be lagging behind on......... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019\n\n5G could be a truly revolutionary technology, said Future Today Institute founder and quantitative futurist Amy Webb. In the near future the tech will enable \"city-scale networks and city-scale spatial computing. Not just the Internet of Things (IoT) as it relates to your office or home environment but a city where devices and sensors and all sorts of things are connected.\"\n\nWhat is 5G?\n\nThe name \"5G\" is a broadcast transmission protocol devised by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a global consortium of telecom groups; it refers to a spectrum of radio frequencies that carriers like Verizon and AT&T will use to transmit data. The radio signal transmits information at an extremely high frequency (EHF), or \"millimeter wave,\" which allows for connections significantly better than current 4G networks.\n\nThe technology promises to transmit a high volume of data to mobile and IoT devices, like connected traffic lights. By some estimates, 5G wireless networks could deliver data at nearly 10 gigabits per second, several orders of magnitude faster than current 4G networks which peak at about 100 megabits per second.\n\n\"4G was a faster way to connect to the internet on the go,\" said Sanyogita Shamsunder, vice president of 5G Labs and Innovation at Verizon. \"5G is not only higher throughputs and higher speeds but it fundamentally is a different way to construct the network to provide fast response times from the internet to the mobile end point, whatever it may be: a phone, a robot, an IoT device.\"\n\nBut with great speed comes great complexity. Because the millimeter wave used by 5G transfers information at short distances, more transmitters and base stations, signal repeaters, are required. This could result in prolonged deployment times and spotty coverage, or no coverage in rural areas. 5G waves are also more susceptible to atmospheric interference and weather conditions like rain.\n\nModern cell towers transmit 4G LTE signals over distances up to several miles, but 5G requires a dense concentration of smaller transmitters to cover the same relative area. Transmitters can be hidden in plain sight on utility poles, street lamps, and rooftops in urban areas. In rural areas there are fewer opportunities to distribute transmitters.\n\n\"Opportunities we see in rural markets are around using 5G, perhaps less for just raw speed, and more for these different IoT use cases, so being able to connect farms and farming equipment and sensors in these agriculture locations, so that you know farmers can get much more insight into how crops are doing and get much better yields out,\" said Samsung's Alok Shah, VP of Networks Strategy, Business Development & Marketing.\n\nThere are also security challenges associated with 5G. Chinese tech giant Huawei is one of the world's largest makers of 5G base stations and transmitters in the world, but its products are currently unavailable to American consumers because of sanctions placed on the company by the U.S. government. Huawei has long faced suspicions of espionage, which its founder and president, Ren Zhengfei, denied this week in an exclusive interview with \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Bianna Golodryga.\n\nHuawei founder: \"5G is not an atomic bomb\"\n\nSuspicions about the company turned to actual charges in January, when the company, its CFO and a subsidiary were indicted on 23 counts ranging from money laundering and obstruction of justice to stealing trade secrets.\n\nVirtual reality, augmented reality, and more\n\nIn spite of the challenges associated with the technology, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about 5G, said Verizon's Shamsunder. \"When we built the 4G networks, we didn't know what was possible. We had video as one of the major use cases but very quickly we enabled industries, the ride hailing industry probably wouldn't exist if we didn't have cellphones today,\" she said.\n\nAugmented reality and virtual reality are likely to gain traction quickly, said Shamsunder. Most contemporary headsets must be directly connected to a PC using USB 3.0 cables. If those headsets were connected to a 5G mobile network instead, the hardware could potentially be untethered, letting the consumer use VR and AR technology in their home, car or on a flight.\n\nSeveral startup companies are experimenting with AR and VR technologies at the Verizon 5G Lab Alley, a coworking space in lower Manhattan. Evercoast is a volumetric capture software to build personalized holographic content. The system uses 16 high-definition cameras that capture images from 180 degrees to record real-time 3D scans. The captured images are then transferred to the cloud and a hologram is rendered almost instantly. After capturing the image, users can look at a glass display or through virtual reality goggles to see themselves in different outfits or settings. It's a truly futuristic use of 5G tech.\n\nIn the next five years, said Shamsunder, 5G could transform a broad spectrum of industries, including \"shopping and education, first responders, public safety, perhaps even nurses and physical therapists.\"\n\nWhat excites her most, though, are the innovations that have not yet been invented. \"I don't know precisely what is coming,\" said Shamsunder, \"but I know it's going to be wireless and it's going to be exciting.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/just-15-minutes-of-jogging-a-day-could-reduce-your-risk-of-depression-study-finds/", "text": "New evidence suggests that even a small amount of exercise \u2013 15 minutes of jogging a day, for example \u2013 could lower your risk of depression.\n\nA recent study by Massachusetts General Hospital looked at more than 600,000 adults, assessing their genetic makeup, medical history and physical activity levels.

That's the equivalent of going from about one call a month to two calls a day. Overall, there were more than 1,800 calls over the entire study period, with two-thirds occurring in the two most recent years.\n\nMore than half of the cases in the study involved serious medical issues, and nearly a third resulted in admission to a health care facility. Side effects in the study ranged from rapid heartbeat, agitation and irritability, and hypertension to seizures, coma, kidney failure, and even death.\n\n\"Kratom use has been associated with a variety of serious medical outcomes, from seizures and coma in adults to severe withdrawal syndrome in newborns,\" Henry Spiller, co-author of the study and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children's Hospital, said in a statement. \"Individuals who choose to use kratom need to be aware of the potential risks.

The FDA has also issued several warnings regarding kratom in recent years.\n\n\"Scientific data we've evaluated about kratom provides conclusive evidence that compounds contained in kratom are opioids and are expected to have similar addictive effects as well as risks of abuse, overdose, and in some cases, death,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement last year.\n\nThe agency is also investigating reports of 44 deaths connected to kratom use.\n\nIn the current study, nine of the 11 deaths reported involved people who had taken another drug with kratom, including alcohol, diphenhydramine (allergy medicine), benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety medications), fentanyl, and cocaine.\n\nForty-eight cases of kratom exposure involved children aged 12 and younger, and 69 percent of these were children younger than 2 years old. Seven were newborns, five of whom were experiencing symptoms of withdrawal.\n\n\"As physicians, we need to educate pregnant women on the risks of kratom use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding,\" Spiller said.\n\nThe study authors call for increased regulation of kratom by the FDA.\n\n\"At a minimum, kratom products should be free of potentially harmful contaminants, provide a uniform strength of active ingredients, and have appropriate labeling,\" they conclude. \"Increased regulation of kratom products would help guarantee product quality and safety.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-care-spending-is-on-track-to-eat-1-in-5-u-s-dollars/", "text": "Americans already spend more on health care than the citizens of any other country.

According to the researchers, more widespread use of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, combined with increased cervical cancer screenings, could prevent millions of cases of the disease worldwide.\n\nCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women across the globe with an estimated 570,000 new cases reported in 2018. It is responsible for killing 300,000 women each year.\n\nLast year, the World Health Organization called for urgent action and coordinated efforts to eliminate the disease. The new study, published in The Lancet Oncology, outlines how this could be possible.\n\nHPV, a group of more than 150 viruses that are sexually transmitted, is responsible for the majority of cervical cancers. It's estimated that HPV vaccines can potentially prevent up to 84 to 90 percent of cervical cancers.\n\nIn high-income countries like the United States, Canada and the U.K., cervical cancer could be eliminated as a public health problem within 25 to 40 years if the recommendations are adopted. Though the HPV vaccine is widely available here, many U.S. teens still don't get it.\n\nOne man's fight to wipe HPV \"off the face of the planet\"\n\nLarge disparities exist in cervical screening and HPV vaccination coverage between countries.

This could result in average rates of the disease falling to less than 4 cases per 100,000 in 149 countries by 2100.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, researchers from Laval University in Quebec say the study will play \"an integral role\" in WHO's global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer.\n\nWho should get the HPV vaccinate?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the HPV vaccine as a routine vaccination for girls and boys at age 11 or 12, though it can be started as early as 9.\n\nThe vaccine is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 and males aged 13 through 21 if they were not previously vaccinated. Young men who are gay or bisexual as well as transgender people who were not previously vaccinated should receive the vaccine through age 26.\n\nThe vaccine has been the source of some controversy in the U.S., with overall lower vaccination rates than countries like Canada, Australia and Britain. Some parents choose to skip the vaccine rather than acknowledge their child will eventually be sexually active.

Three 5-gallon buckets have been removed from a building about a half mile from the South Rim that houses the park's archives and artifacts. About 550 people tour the collections each year, mostly by appointment.\n\nThe National Park Service is working with Arizona health and workplace safety officials on the investigation. The agency also plans to set up a hotline for anyone concerned about potential radiation exposure, said spokeswoman Vanessa Lacayo.\n\n\"One of the important pieces is looking and determining the level of exposure and risk,\" she said.\n\nThe Arizona Republic cited the Grand Canyon's safety director, Elston \"Swede\" Stephenson, in saying the park failed to warn workers or the public of the potential harm that existed for years.\n\n\"If you were in the Museum Collections Building (2C) between the year 2000 and June 18, 2018, you were 'exposed' to uranium by OSHA's definition,\" Stephenson wrote, according to the newspaper. \"The radiation readings, at first blush, exceeds (sic) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's safe limits. \u2026 Identifying who was exposed, and your exposure level, gets tricky and is our next important task.\"\n\nStephenson claimed he asked National Park executives to publicize the risks but was ignored.\n\nStephenson did not return messages left by The Associated Press at his work email and on social media. A call to a number listed for him in a park directory went unanswered.\n\nUranium is naturally occurring in northern Arizona and was mined for decades, including at the Orphan Mine on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon that ceased operations in 1969. A temporary ban prohibits the filing of new mining claims within 1 million acres outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park. The Navajo Nation no longer allows uranium mining after it left a legacy of death and disease on the reservation.\n\nStill, companies have active claims that weren't affected by the ban and could resume mining.\n\nLacayo said the area where the plastic buckets were stored was not a part of the tour of the building known as the Museum Collection, though people did walk past the area.\n\nStephenson told the Arizona Republic the buckets were near a taxidermy exhibit where children sometimes stopped for presentations, and the lid on one bucket wasn't sealed.\n\nJani Ingram, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Northern Arizona University, said it's not uncommon for uranium ore to be used in research. But, she said, it's typically sealed in a metal container so that radon gas and dust aren't released into the air.\n\nUranium can be harmful to people's health depending on the amount and grade of ore, how people interact with it and the exposure time, she said. Geiger counters can be a good, initial indication of the presence of radiation but further study would be needed to determine the risk.\n\n\"You can't say, 'oh my gosh, all those kids are going to develop cancer in five years' because you just don't know how close they were, how long they were there,\" she said. \"But that open bucket was probably the most concerning. It seemed that maybe whoever it was didn't understand what they had.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oakland-teachers-strike-first-in-over-20-years-affects-36000-students-2019-02-21/", "text": "Teachers in Oakland, California, went on strike Thursday, part of a national wave of discontent by educators over classroom conditions, pay and other issues. Recent walkouts have taken place in West Virginia, Los Angeles and Denver.\n\nThe city's 3,000 teachers want a 12 percent retroactive raise covering 2017 to 2020 to compensate for what they say are the among the lowest salaries for public school teachers in the expensive San Francisco Bay Area. They also want the district to hire more counselors to support students and more full-time nurses.\n\nKindergarten teacher Kaki Blackburn, 30, was among dozens picketing outside Manzanita Community School with signs saying \"On strike For a Living Wage.\" Blackburn, who has 29 kids in her class, said her main concerns were class size and wages.\n\nShe said her salary makes it impossible to afford an apartment on her own. \"There's no way I'd be able to live here without a roommate,\" she said. \"This is not what I went to Brown University to get a master's for.\"\n\nThe teacher union's leader said the educators were forced to strike for the first time in more than 20 years because administrators did not listen to their demands for two years. \"For two years we have been negotiating with the Oakland Unified School District to make our students a priority over outside consultants and central office administrators,\" said Oakland Education Association President Keith Brown.\n\nThe walkout affects 36,000 students at 86 schools.\n\nOakland Unified School District students and teachers carry signs as they picket outside of Oakland Technical High School on Feb. 21, 2019, in Oakland, Calif. Getty\n\nThe district initially offered a 5 percent raise covering 2017 to 2020, saying it is squeezed by rising costs and a budget crisis. In negotiations Wednesday aimed at averting a strike, the district increased its proposal to a 7 percent raise over four years and a one-time 1.5 percent bonus.\n\nThe offer went higher than the recommendation of an independent fact-finding report that suggested a compromise 6 percent retroactive raise. But union officials rejected the offer.\n\n\"That bonus is almost nothing,\" Skyline High School teacher Jeff Rector told CBS San Francisco. \"It doesn't follow me forward, and it's not enough money to make a difference right now. That 7 percent raise is still barely enough to cover inflation.\"\n\nOakland Unified School District spokesman John Sasaki said school administrators hope to get a counter proposal from the union when negotiations resume Friday. \"We haven't heard any proposal since last May so we're hoping they have something for us when we meet tomorrow,\" Sasaki said.\n\nThe district said schools would remain open, staffed by non-union employees and substitute teachers. However, parents should not expect teaching as usual, it said. Manzanita Principal Eyana Spencer said 14 of the school's 450 students turned up for school Thursday and were placed in one classroom to play games.\n\nTeachers have been working without a contract since 2017 and have said their salaries have not kept up with the cost of living. A starting salary in the district is $46,500 a year and the average salary is $63,000, according to the union. Nearly 600 teachers left their jobs at Oakland public schools last year, according to the union, which has said the district cannot retain teachers or attract experienced new teachers.\n\nThe union has called for the district to scrap plans to close as many as 24 schools that serve primarily African-American and Latino students. The union fears further students will be lost to charter schools that drain more than $57 million a year from the district.\n\nRecent strikes across the nation have built on a wave of teacher activism that began last spring. Unions for West Virginia teachers, who staged a nine-day walkout last year, ended another two-day strike Wednesday.\n\nLast week, teachers in Denver ended a three-day walkout after reaching a tentative deal raising their wages. Teachers in Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district, staged a six-day strike last month that ended when they settled on a 6 percent raise with promises of smaller class sizes and the addition of nurses and counselors."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://secure-fly.cbsnews.com/news/eddie-johnson-chicago-police-department-superintendent-calls-jussie-smollet-attack-hoax-shameful-in-news-conference-today-2019-02-21/", "text": "Chicago's top police officer expressed anger and frustration Thursday over what he called Jussie Smollett's \"shameful\" attempt to fabricate a hate crime for a \"publicity stunt.\"\n\n\"When we discovered the actual motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off,\" said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. He said police were treating Smollett like a victim until then.\n\nSmollett's story that he was attacked January 29 by masked assailants who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and hung a rope around his neck unraveled when two of Smollett's acquaintances, brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, told investigators the actor paid them $3,500 to stage the attack, said Johnson.\n\nJohnson said Smollett, 36, choreographed the attack because he was dissatisfied with his salary. He castigated Smollett for putting the national spotlight on Chicago for something \"that is both egregious and untrue,\" and said bogus police reports harm legitimate victims by wasting valuable police resources.\n\nSpeaking on CBSN following the press conference in Chicago, CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds said he's covered Johnson for several years and has \"seldom heard him as angry as he was today.\"\n\n\"What he said was a mixture of contempt, disgust and basic anger,\" Reynolds said.\n\nThe \"Empire\" actor turned himself in on a felony count of filing a false police report.

The statement described Smollett as a man of \"impeccable character and integrity\" who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.\n\nJohnson gave credit to his detectives for a \"patient and deliberate\" investigation that he said began with giving Smollett the benefit of the doubt and eventually uncovered the truth after weeks of combing through video evidence and following up on leads. He called Smollett a \"troubled young man who resorted to both drastic and illegal actions.\"\n\nJussie Smollett turned himself in, charged with filing false police report\n\n\"I'm offended by what's happened, and I'm also angry,\" Johnson said. \"I love the city of the Chicago and the Chicago Police Department, warts and all.

He said that Chicago police investigated the case as they would any other hate crime, and insisted it didn't take away resources from investigations into the shootings and homicides that have plagued the city. He also took the media to task, calling for the same level of coverage for victims of gun violence.\n\nJohnson said Thursday he spoke not only as the police superintendent, but as a black man who grew up in Chicago and understands the city's racial divide. He said Smollett \"took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career\" and said he was baffled as to why anyone, especially an African-American man, \"would use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations.\"\n\n\"How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?\" Johnson said. \"How could this individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?\"\n\nJohnson said the department would continue to investigate hate crimes with the same vigor, but feared that victims of hate crimes will \"be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn't happen.\"\n\nHe called for Smollett to admit his actions and apologize.\n\n\"Absolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared, admitting what he did, and then being man enough to offer what he should offer up in terms of all the resources that were put into this,\" Johnson said."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://secure-fly.cbsnews.com/news/tnt-cancels-drop-the-mic-episode-jussie-smollett-danielle-brooks-clay-aiken-ian-ziering-2019-02-21/", "text": "TNT said Thursday it isn't going to air an upcoming episode of \"Drop the Mic\" featuring \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett \"in the interest of not being exploitative of an incredibly sensitive situation.\" The cable network said it would shelve the episode of the battle-rap show that pitted Smollett against Danielle Brooks, an actress on \"Orange is the New Black.\"\n\nInstead it will air an episode that features actress Raven-Symon\u00e9 taking on comedian Ron Funches.

I'm so scared\u2026\"\n\nLexi Kavanaugh: He did send me several text messages that really tugged on my heartstrings.\n\nCory Page [reading texts]: \"I love you with all my heart.\"\n\nLexi Kavanaugh: He was reiterating that he loved me continuously \u2026 That was really what started to scare me.\n\nCory Page [reading texts]: \"Lexi, I'm terrified\u2026\"\n\nLexi Kavanaugh: He was terrified enough to talk to me in this way\u2026\n\nMaryLinda Moss: The assailant was clearly weak from the wound \u2026 but he kept on looking out to the door obviously aware that the police were out there.\n\nWhat the hostages did not know was that about two hours earlier, the gunman had shot his grandmother seven times. He also injured his 17-year-old girlfriend, but because she was a minor, her name and details about her injury have never been released.\n\nHours before the standoff at Trader Joe's, the gunman had shot his grandmother seven times; she survived. He also injured his 17-year-old girlfriend.\n\nRichard Winton: What happened is the -- the gunman had a -- essentially a domestic dispute with his girlfriend and his grandmother had been involved.\n\nRichard Winton covered the story for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nRichard Winton: You can't have a more dangerous kind of gunman than someone who's already shot their nearest and dearest.\n\nKCAL ANCHOR: An unknown number of people are still being held hostage \u2026\n\nRichard Winton: Everyone was trying to assess where this was going \u2026 how many people will he kill?\n\nMaryLinda Moss: He looks to me and he said, \"Come over here and massage my hand.\"\u2026 And it felt very uncomfortable. It's not what I wanted to do \u2026 but -- he has a gun, he's asking me to come over, so that's what I did.\n\nRichard Winton: He was very obsessed with talking to those he'd already done harm to.\n\nThe gunman made frantic phone calls and learned his grandmother was still alive.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: He then started going into shock and was shivering \u2026 He said, \"There are some jackets down there\" and so I very specifically said, \"Would you like me to get them?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" \u2026 And as I went, I saw a woman lying behind the manager's counter. \u2026 As I walked by her, she didn't move. \u2026 I looked down and that's when I saw that she was lying in a pool of blood and it was devastating.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: So, I said to him, \"There's a woman who's been shot. And she probably needs help.\" And he yelled back at me, \"That was the cops not me!\" \u2026 And I said, \"Can we get her help? Can we take her outside?\" And he said, \"OK.\"\n\nA Trader Joe's employee brought the dying woman outside and then ran to safety. The hostages would later learn her name was Melyda Corado, known as Mely, the store manager. She was 27 years old.\n\nTrader Joe's manager Melyda Corado, 27, was killed. Caught in the crossfire between police and the gunman, she was hit by an officer's bullet. GoFundMe via CBS LA\n\nMaryLinda Moss: She was doing what she was doing, running out to help somebody, because that's the kind of person that she was.\n\nMely was caught in the crossfire between police and the gunman -- hit by an officer's bullet.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And then his phone rings. It's the police. \u2026 The police officer introduced himself. He was encouraging him to let everyone go.\n\nThe gunman was told his girlfriend was also alive and headed into surgery. Then he made a demand.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: \"You get her on the phone with me, I'll turn myself in.\" \u2026 And then he hung up.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: He was getting really amped up.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: He then, within the next couple minutes, said, \"How many people are in the store? Bring them here.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: Oh sh--!\n\nA WAITING GAME\n\nLynne Westafer: We're in a single file, hands up. And we walk from the bread aisle down \u2026 and there is stuff scattered -- baskets overturned and there is [becomes emotional] abandoned purses and there is things knocked off the shelves and it's so empty.\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: I see blood all over the floor. \u2026 It looked like a murder scene, it was blood everywhere.\n\nArta and Lynne were among 13 hostages who were brought to the front of the store.\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: You look at the register and he's sitting right there. \u2026 And I saw my shopping cart that I left right in front of him.\n\nLynne Westafer: There's the gunman who's covered in a sweatshirt. It's got a hood up. And there's several people around him.\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: You see his gunshot wound in his arm.\n\nLynne Westafer: So, I'm trying to\u2026 take him in \u2026 and I think I see a young female Trader Joe's employee holding his hand. \u2026 I see there's this other woman who is rubbing on his back a little bit. \u2026What is going on? Like, grab the gun for Ch----'s sake!\n\nMaryLinda Moss: I had been massaging his shoulder \u2026 I was trying to help ground him.\n\nMaryLinda felt she understood the gunman. She says she had a troubled childhood and began using alcohol and drugs before getting sober at the age of 18. She spent years in therapy in order to pull her life back together.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: Over the years I have been with people who have \u2026 made \u2026 bad choices in their life \u2026 I have learned how to be present with them without judgment. \u2026 That allowed me to be present with the assailant in a way that perhaps I wouldn't have been able to be.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: He said to me, \"You have nothing to do with this. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want anybody to get hurt.\" \u2026 I then reached over and I put my hand on his heart \u2026 and I looked at him in his eyes, and I said, \"I know you have a good heart and I know you don't want to hurt anybody.\" And he said, \"You don't know what I did this morning.\" And my hand, still on his heart, I said, \"It doesn't matter, I know you have a good heart, and I know you don't want to hurt anybody.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: He was a guy in so far over his head and I'm glad that that woman was able to help him. At the time I had mixed feelings about it because I just wished that someone would grab the gun and end this. That's what I kept thinking, like, \"grab the gun.\" To be fair \u2026 if I had been sitting next to him I don't know if I could have grabbed the gun. \u2026 I wanted someone to do that, but I don't know if I could have done that. That's the truth.\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: When we first got to the front \u2026 he asked the Trader Joe's employee \u2026 to pick somebody from the crowd.\n\nLynne Westafer: I heard that young guy say, \"You want me to choose?\" and I thought, \"Choose what?\"\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: And I sort of put my head down because I was like, he's maybe he's trying to ask him to pick someone that he wants to shoot next.\n\nLynne Westafer: And he turned and he pointed at this boy who was like 13, 14. And he said, \"I choose you,\" and I thought, \"choose him for what?\"\n\nLynne Westafer: I wanted to just like grab him \u2026 and say, \"No don't choose him! What is happening?\" \u2026 And then the Trader Joe's guy said, \"He's letting you go,\" and I thought \"Oh\" [sighs in relief].\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: \"You can go out with your hands up.\"\n\nLexi Kavanaugh: I have never seen so much of a police presence in my life.\n\nWhile waiting for texts from her friend Cory, Lexi who lived about 5 minutes from the Trader Joe's, was glued to the television coverage.\n\nKCAL ANCHOR: Police are getting into position, they are on tactical alert \u2026\n\nLexi Kavanaugh: I saw multiple helicopters above my house, there was the S.W.A.T. team, there was a tank on the street \u2026 It looked like an apocalyptic event.\n\nROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCory Page: I definitely could hear people crying in the closet. I couldn't really pinpoint who because I couldn't see people's faces. \u2026It's sort of like this wave. It would get super quiet and then it would get louder, people would get more comfortable and, you know, they'd whip out their phone again and start having a conversation with a loved one or the police. And then we would hear stuff from the front of the store. And so then we would all get really quiet. And it went on like that.\n\n\"I was convinced that there was not only one, but multiple active shooters, and it was only a matter of time before they were gonna find us,\" said Cory Page. CBS News\n\nCory Page: The reason why I was pushing myself further and further back under the sink was because I was convinced that there was not only one, but multiple active shooters, and it was only a matter of time before they were gonna find us.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: We were just waiting for the phone call with the girlfriend.\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: We just sat there waiting. \u2026 Surprisingly, no one was like crying or screaming or yelling.\n\nBut even in the quieter moments, it was never completely silent.\n\nCory Page: The crazy part about being inside a grocery store is \u2026 this underlying soundtrack to the whole \u2013 the whole event.\n\nLynne Westafer: There was a moment when \u2026 the song that was playing was Stevie Wonder, \"My Cherie Amour.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: So, Stevie Wonder then becomes the soundtrack for your nightmare. ... It was just like -- perfectly horrifying.\n\nBy now, approximately an hour had passed. In addition to the boy, other hostages had been allowed to go. A Trader Joe's employee was trying to keep up morale.\n\nLynne Westafer: He turned around and he said to us in the calmest voice, \"It's gonna be OK. He's letting people go. I'm gonna be the last one out.\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: There was this woman, around 30 years old, she was clearly terrified. So, I asked him if he would let this woman go. \u2026 Within a minute or two, he said yes. \u2026When she gets right in front of the door, the automatic door opens and the assailant yells, \"Stop!\"\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: As she was standing at the door, the door kept opening and closing and he said, \"Do not walk out.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: \"Come back here.\" And she took a step back towards him, and the doors opened again. He said, \" Stop opening the doors.\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: She looks at me like, what am I supposed to do? \u2026 so I shook my head, \"yes.\"\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: And she just jetted. She ran out of there.\n\nLynne Westafer: And I thought, oh great, now we're all gonna get shot.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: He said, \"She left! I told her to stop and she left!\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: Then he asked the Trader Joe's employee who was standing there, \"do you have the keys?\"\n\nLynne Westafer: He said, \"Lock the damn door.\"\n\nTHE COUNTDOWN\n\nLynne Westafer: When that front door locked, it was like, wham, you know, it's game over.\n\nOutside, the SWAT team made its next move.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: The assailant looks out the door and he says, \"What is that sniper doing on the roof?\"\n\nLynne Westafer: And sure enough there was \u2026 a sniper on the roof of the cheese store, next door to the Trader Joe's.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: The gun aimed right at us.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: The assailant starts yelling to the police on the phone, \"What is that guy doing there? Get the guy off the roof!\"\n\nLynne Westafer: And they're screaming \u2026 \"Get that guy off the roof, you've got to get him off the roof!\"\n\nWhat the gunman could not see was that there were three sharpshooters on the roof of the cheese store across the street. KCAL\n\nWhat they couldn't see was that there were three sharp shooters on the roof.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: I'm yelling to the sergeant. And the sergeant's like, \"Let me see if I can reach them.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: \"Why won't you get the guy off the roof? Get him off! Get him off! Why won't you do it?\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: We were in danger in a way we had not been before that.\n\nLynne Westafer: This yelling \u2026 went on for five minutes. Do you know how long five minutes is in hostage time?\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: I was ready to run.\n\nLynne Westafer: Finally the gunman is so aggravated that he says, \"If you don't get 'em off the roof, I'm gonna shoot somebody.\"\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: And that's when he starts counting down from five.\n\nLynne Westafer: I'm gonna shoot somebody in FIVE\u2026\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: FOUR\u2026\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And I'm saying , \"GET HIM OFF THE ROOF!\" \u2026 THREE \u2026\n\nLynne Westafer: When he got to two \u2026 the sniper climbed off the roof. Do you know how he got off the roof? Another officer climbed up and tapped him on the arm. \u2026 Like, did his walkie talkie not get charged? \u2026 How did that happen? \u2026 It almost was IT for somebody.\n\nLynne Westafer: After the sniper got off the roof, there was this silence. It was like the most scary sound of nothing.\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: We're like, OK. There's no hope in here. There's no hope.\n\n\"Do you know what it feels like to be sitting on the floor of a grocery store \u2026 and you get increasingly afraid that the people who are there who are supposed to save you, are -- are making it worse for you?\" said Lynne Westafer. CBS News\n\nMaryLinda, who had been trying to keep the gunman calm, also acted as an intermediary between him and the LAPD during their many phone calls.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And so I said into the phone to the sergeant, I said, \"You need to know that we are all very, very, very scared and it is because of what just happened.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: Do you know what it feels like to be sitting on the floor of a grocery store \u2026 and you get increasingly afraid that the people who are there who are supposed to save you, are -- are making it worse for you?\n\nLynne Westafer: It gives me no pleasure to beat up on the LAPD, but I would not be doing my job as a witness \u2026 if I didn't say what happened here.\n\nRichard Winton | Los Angeles Times: The hostages see the incident in one way and SWAT officers see it in a different way.\n\nThe LAPD declined to comment citing an ongoing investigation. Richard Winton says in the age of mass shootings, police are pressured to act quickly.\n\nRichard Winton: The protocols are very different these days post Columbine. No one waits. \u2026 It's try and rush in. \u2026 Here I think at the end they ultimately decided it wasn't a mass shooter scenario that he was more of a man who has some history of mental struggles. \u2026 And that's where I think they make the fine line decision. Don't rush in, let's try and talk him down.\n\nBut Winton says the LAPD didn't know what to make of MaryLinda.\n\nRichard Winton: SWAT negotiators are used to dealing with the person directly. They want to hear their voice, they want to know what their tone is, they want to understand what's going on exactly from them.\n\nBack in the closet, the hostages watched snippets of the drama in silence.\n\nCory Page: I think when you are surrounded by 20-plus people in a room that is no bigger than like an average closet, everyone's deepest and darkest personalities will come out.\n\nCory Page: This guy, there were, like five or so knives on a magnet on the wall cause it was the food prep area for where they give out the samples \u2026 and he and another person grabbed a knife and they were like, \"If things go south, like we're gonna, we're gonna take him down.\" And it immediately terrified me. Because I knew \u2026 we needed to stay as quiet and as undiscovered as possible.\n\nIn the front of the store, a new LAPD negotiator called to say an officer was being sent to the hospital to talk to the gunman's girlfriend.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: It was starting to feel like they were just delaying and he was getting more frustrated.\n\n\"Our lives were on the line for a phone call,\" said Arta Gjonbalaj. CBS News\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: Our lives are on the line for a phone call.\n\nThen, more pressure from the LAPD.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: The assailant looks towards the door \u2026 \"What is that truck doing there?\" And I look \u2026 and there is a SWAT truck, right in front of the door.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And he starts with the new negotiator, \"What are you doing, what's that SWAT truck doing there, get it out of there.\" \u2026 And so they back it up, like a foot [laughs]. And then stop.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And I think he realized that there was not gonna be a better way out of here. \u2026 He said, \"Get me my call with my girlfriend \u2026\"\n\nLAPD OFFICER: OK that \u2013 that \u2013 that works for me. Just \u2013 OK. Do me a favor, just hang tight.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: \"\u2026 send handcuffs in ...\"\n\nLAPD OFFICER: He says, \"If you guys could \u2013 would \u2013 would throw a \u2013 throw a set of handcuffs in\u2026\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: \"\u2026I will let myself be handcuffed and give over my gun and I will turn myself in.\" And then he hung up the phone. \u2026 And I was like, \"that was it, that was the solution. \u2026We've got our way out!\"\n\nAN EXIT STRATEGY\n\nAs the frightening standoff continued, the frustrated gunman repeated his demands to the police negotiator.\n\nKCAL REPORTER: The suspect is barricaded. Police are trying to get him to surrender\u2026\n\nMaryLinda Moss: So the assailant said \u2026 \"send in the handcuffs, get my call with my girlfriend, and I'll turn myself in.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: The gunman believed that if he walked out handcuffed he was less likely to be shot by the police. So there was a long negotiation to try to get the police to give a pair of handcuffs. \u2026 Finally, they agreed.\n\nLynne Westafer: And a young man who has been a customer in the store \u2013 Mike \u2026 was gonna walk to the front door and he was gonna get the handcuffs.\n\nMike D'Angelo had been quietly assisting MaryLinda from the beginning.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: Mike had already been going and getting things for the assailant.\n\nMary Linda Moss: I mean we really \u2026 depended on each other.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: I told the negotiator \u2026 \"Mike is coming out. \u2026 He's coming to get the handcuffs.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: So Mike starts to walk towards the door.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: The Trader Joe's employee unlocks the door\u2026\n\nChris Ritzen | \"48 Hours\" producer: Were you scared?\n\nMike D'Angelo: Yeah, we didn't know what was gonna happen next.\n\nKCAL CHOPPER AUDIO: This is NOT the suspect. Now this is NOT the suspect.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And then I see the SWAT team member \u2026 start gesturing strongly for Mike to come out. \u2026And both Mike and I at the same time start yelling, \"No, no, no, no-no-no-no-no-no-no!\" I'm like, I'm into the phone, \"No, no, no, no. \u2026 Throw the handcuffs in.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: Now Mike, bravely, is standing at the doorway saying, \"Give me the handcuffs.\" \u2026 All the while officers are trying to get him to leave.\n\nMike D'Angelo: And I said, \"There's no way I'm leaving these people here.\"\n\nLynne Westafer: The gunman was saying \u2026 \"Don't you go out that door, you better bring those handcuffs back here.\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss, who had been trying to keep the gunman calm, also acted as an intermediary between him and the LAPD during their many phone calls. CBS News\n\nMaryLinda Moss: He'd already said, \"I'm going to get myself handcuffed \u2026 I'm gonna turn myself in. \u2026The trust that we had developed was key in him following through with what he had said.\n\nLynne Westafer: After many more minutes of yelling, screaming\u2026 that panic, just that screeching losing your voice kind of shouting\u2026\n\nMaryLinda Moss: No-no-no-no. \u2026 No-no-no-no-no! \"Throw the handcuffs! Throw the handcuffs!\" I'm yelling out the door. I'm yelling into the phone\u2026\n\nLynne Westafer: There was this \"thunk\" [claps her hands] as the handcuffs hit the linoleum.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And the assailant jumps and tenses. And I \u2013 and I'm like, \"It's the handcuffs.\"\u2026 And I say, \"Mike, pick up the handcuffs! Show him it's the handcuffs!\"\n\nLynne Westafer: And then Mike walked back in\u2026\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And then we have the handcuffs.\n\nLynne Westafer: What a hero.\n\nMike D'Angelo: I didn't want to let the people down or anybody to get hurt. So I stayed.\n\nRichard Winton: There was a lot of reluctance on the part of the police to give him the handcuffs. He could take the handcuffs and handcuff himself to a hostage and make them a human shield. So, they had to really buy into this idea that he would handcuff himself.\n\nKCAL CHOPPER AUDIO: They've got the suspect on the phone. But they're trying to get the girlfriend to talk to him or something\u2026\n\nMaryLinda Moss: He then is getting more and more frustrated with them not getting his girlfriend on the phone.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: The assailant said to me, \"They're not trying to get her.\" I said, \"Of course they are.\" \u2026 This is our way out.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: This is a guy who's saying he's gonna let himself out if you get him a f---ing phone call! Right?\n\nMaryLinda Moss: When we were waiting to hear about his girlfriend \u2026 he said, \"It's all over. It doesn't matter what happens to me. \u2026 I'm in for life.\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: I said to him I had known people who had been in prison for many years, and who had made lives for themselves inside prison. \u2026 And that there was always hope.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And he said to me, \"I wish I had met you earlier. I just needed somebody to talk to.\"\n\nAt just about that time, the negotiator called. The police had finally contacted the gunman's injured girlfriend. She recorded a short message.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And she said, \"I'm OK. Go outside. I'm OK. Go outside.\" \u2026 She said it three times. \u2026 And that clearly gave him the relief that he was looking for. \u2026 He never asked again for a phone call. That was enough.\n\nWith his demands met, he released more hostages. Arta noticed a mother and daughter were about to be let go.\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: At that point, something told me, pretend she's your mom. \u2026 So I grabbed her hand and she grabs mine back.\n\nThe gunman then asked, \"Is this also your daughter?\"\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: And she said, \"Yes, this is my daughter.\" And he said, \"You can get up and go with your sister.\"\n\nArta Gjonbalaj, pictured at right in black,and her \"sister\" are seen after their release from the store KCAL\n\nAnd just like that, Arta was free and allowed to leave with her \"sister.\"\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: I just walked out as fast as I can.\n\nMoments later, the woman who risked her life pretending to be her mom was also released.\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: I gave her the biggest hug in the whole world.\n\nAnd then Arta called her real mom.\n\nNaze Gjonbalaj: Everything is OK because I got my daughter alive.\n\nArta Gjonbalaj: It was just a lot of tears at that point. \u2026 It was relief, but it was also, \"Wow, that was the closest I've ever been to death.\"\n\nNext, it was Lynne's turn.\n\nLynne Westafer: Most of the other hostages, when they were leaving, turned to him and they said [she whispers], \"Thank you. Thank you.\" \u2026 I was just getting madder and madder.\n\nLynne Westafer: And when I stood up, I very intentionally did not look at him \u2026 because I thought, if I turned around to say anything to him, I wouldn't be saying, \"thank you.\" I'd be saying, \"f--- you.\" And that would be bad for everybody. \u2026 So I just looked straight ahead \u2026 and out I went.\n\nThe police had negotiated a plan with the assailant to leave the store and surrender safely. But he was still there with four hostages and still holding the gun.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: He was afraid to walk down the long aisle to the door where they could see him. \u2026 He was afraid he was gonna get shot.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: I actually turned to him. I took his face in my hands. \u2026 I said \u2026 \"Do you trust me?\" And he said, \"Yes.\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: But he's still thinking that they're gonna shoot him. So I looked at the other three \u2026 and I say, \"Should we go out together?\" And they all three shake their head, \"Yes. We'll go out together.\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: So I ask him if he's ready to be handcuffed, and he says, \"Yes.\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: And then I ask him if I can take the gun, and he says, \"Yes.\"\n\nMaryLinda Moss: So I then ask him, \"Are you ready?\" He said, \"Ah, I need a little bit more time.\" As we're waiting, I heard a noise on the roof. \u2026 And it scared me.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: So I didn't ask for permission.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: I said, \"It's time to do this now.\"\n\nA PEACEFUL END\n\nMaryLinda Moss: The negotiator said, \"OK, we're ready.\" \u2026 I look to the other three. We all stand up together. I'm in front of him. The others kinda circle behind him.\n\nKCAL CHOPPER AUDIO: They're close to getting him out. But I don't know \u2026 KCAL CHOPPER AUDIO: I see some shadows\u2026\n\nMaryLinda Moss: We walked down and we get to the door, the door opens.\n\nKCAL CHOPPER AUDIO: Here they come.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: We take a step out.\n\nWith their arms raised, MaryLinda Moss and gunman Gene Atkins, in handcuffs, and the remaining hostages walked out of the store together KCAL\n\nRichard Winton: Everyone expected him to come last, on his own. But they kind of came with him. \u2026 Almost like making sure he was OK, 'cause he was bleeding.\n\nMaryLinda Moss: We are descended upon. A lot of SWAT team members.\n\nAs the hostages were taken away, the gunman whose name is Gene Atkins, surrendered without a fight.\n\nGene Atkins surrendered to police after the 3-hour standoff KCAL\n\nMaryLinda Moss: I was aware of them taking Gene over to handle him, but I was really like, it was done. \u2026 That's when I felt the relief.\n\nBut for Cory and the 20 others who were still hiding in the closet, it would take 15 long minutes before the SWAT team freed them.\n\nCory Page: I put my hands up and we filed out of the closet. \u2026 I just immediately started crying. Every bit of emotion that I had bottled up because I didn't want to either make noise or I didn't want to express how I was really feeling while I was inside of there, it all came out.\n\nDown the street waiting for Cory was his best friend Lexi, whose text messages kept him calm during his darkest moments.\n\nLexi Kavanaugh: We just held each other so close and that's when I cracked. \u2026 I could feel all of that hardened adrenaline \u2026 wear off and relax and I just sort of like melted and broke down a little bit. \u2026 I told him I loved him a million times.\n\nKCAL ANCHOR: Well the good news is again it appears that this has been brought to a peaceful end.

The 30 percent increase coincides with Donald Trump's campaign and presidency. It comes on the heels of three consecutive years of decline near the end of former President Obama's time in office.\n\nSPLC counted 784 hate groups in 2014, a figure that rose to 954 in 2017 and then 1,020 in 2018. The Alabama-based law center said last year's total surpassed the previous high reported in 2011.\n\nThe recent increase \"dovetails with (Donald) Trump's campaign and then his presidency, a period that has seen a 30 percent increase in the number of these groups,\" said Heidi Beirich, director of SPLC's Intelligence Project. \"In the three years prior to that, during the waning years of (Barack Obama's) presidency, hate groups were actually on the decline.\"\n\nSouthern Poverty Law Center\n\n\"The numbers tell a striking story \u2014 that this president is not simply a polarizing figure but a radicalizing one,\" Beirich added. \"Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as presidents of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it \u2014 with both his rhetoric and his policies. In doing so, he's given people across America the go-ahead to act on their worst instincts.\"\n\nSPLC points out the vast majority of hate groups \u2014 including neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan, racist skinheads, neo-Confederates and white nationalists \u2014 adhere to some form of white supremacist ideology. The number of white nationalist groups, those particularly electrified by the Trump presidency, surged by almost 50 percent \u2014 from 100 groups to 148 \u2014 in 2018, according to SPLC.\n\n\"The KKK has not been able to appeal to younger racists, with its antiquated traditions, odd dress and lack of digital savvy,\" the report said. \"Younger extremists prefer Fred Perry polo shirts and khakis to Klan robes.\"\n\nAccording to data from the FBI, hate crime incidents targeting Jews and Jewish institutions in the U.S. spiked by about 37 percent between 2016 and 2017. Overall, hate crimes most frequently targeted victims based on race, ethnicity, religion or ancestry, making up about 80 percent of the total. The bureau has not released information yet for 2018.\n\nFBI finds increase in number of hate crimes reported\n\nSPLC also debuted a new way to explore its findings on hate groups across the country with an interactive map. It shows how the number of hate groups has changed over time at the state and national levels. The law center said users can also filter the map to focus on particular ideologies, such as white nationalist groups.\n\nHate group definition controversy\n\nSome groups on the list have disputed the SPLC's findings or even sued over the hate-group label. Some have accused the law center of political bias.\n\nLiberty Counsel Inc., a Florida-based legal advocacy organization, sued after a website that maintains a charity database flagged it and 45 other nonprofits as being labeled as hate groups by the law center, the Associated Press reports. Liberty Counsel describes itself as a Christian organization that advocates for family values, but SPLC labels it an \"anti-LGBT\" hate group. A federal judge in Virginia threw out that lawsuit.\n\nA federal magistrate in Alabama recommended the dismissal of a separate lawsuit that accused the SPLC of defaming a Florida-based evangelical ministry by designating it as a hate group."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ted-cruz-wants-drug-kingpin-el-chapo-to-fund-trumps-border-wall/", "text": "While Washington continues to debate funding over President Trump's long-promised border wall along the southern border, Sen.

Indeed, I have long called for building a wall as a necessary step in defending our border. Fourteen billion dollars will go a long way to secure our southern border, and hinder the illegal flow of drugs, weapons, and individuals.

On Tuesday, jurors found Guzm\u00e1n guilty on all 10 counts in his drug trafficking and murder trial at a federal court in New York City.\n\n60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker has been covering the almost-mythical criminal pedigree of the Mexican drug lord since he was captured in Mexico in 2014. Here are some of those reports.\n\n2014: Public Enemy Number 1 is caught\n\nWhen Mexican marines captured Guzm\u00e1n in 2014, he had been on 13-year run from the law after escaping from a Mexican prison in 2001. He was the most wanted man in the world; his international drug cartel put him at the top of the list.\n\n\"Making billions of dollars, having a reach around the world in Asia, Australia, in Africa, in Europe; putting poison on the streets, not just in the United States, but all over the world,\" Derek Maltz told Whitaker in the video above. Maltz was in charge of the DEA's Special Operations Division tasked with finding Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nAfter years of independent searching, Mexican law enforcement had teamed up with several U.S. law enforcement agencies to track the drug lord. After streamlining their efforts, the group tracked Guzm\u00e1n to a non-descript house in the midst of a middle-class Mexican neighborhood. But as soon as the Mexican marines arrived, Guzm\u00e1n escaped down a tunnel underneath his bathtub.\n\nMaltz feared the drug lord would continue evading arrest. \"I never believed that he would ever be captured,\" he said.\n\nBut the Mexican marines were relentless. With the help of American law enforcement, they tracked Guzm\u00e1n to a beachfront building in Mazatl\u00e1n, where they finally captured him and arrested him.\n\n\"We did not ever anticipate that he'd be captured alive,\" said Jim Dinkins, who was head of Homeland Security Investigations and had pursued Guzm\u00e1n for more than a decade. \"We thought he'd fight to the death.\"\n\n2015: \"El Chapo\" escapes from prison\n\nGuzm\u00e1n had already escaped from prison once. In 2015, he did it again.\n\nAlmost from the moment he was delivered to Altiplano Prison, a maximum security facility in Mexico, a construction crew from his Sinaloa cartel began digging a tunnel to free him. From almost a mile away, Guzm\u00e1n's men dug down about three stories and then burrowed 4,921 feet straight toward Altiplano. The tunnel went under the prison wall and beneath the plumbing \u2014 and with remarkable accuracy, emerged straight into Guzm\u00e1n's shower stall.\n\n\"It's very difficult to navigate underground,\" Dinkins said. \"This tunnel, I believe, went from point A to point B with only minor deviations, if any. And that is an engineering marvel in and of itself.\"\n\nDEA Chief Chuck Rosenberg told Whitaker how he thought it might be possible: corruption and bribes within Mexican law enforcement.\n\n\"I don't know specifically how high up they reach,\" Rosenberg said. \"My sense is that they're both broad and deep, that they go throughout the Mexican government.\"\n\nJoe DiMeglio, the chief of the San Diego Tunnel Task Force, told Whitaker that he wasn't sure Guzm\u00e1n would ever be caught again.\n\n2015: The greatest escape\n\n2016: Recapturing \"El Chapo\"\n\nBut unlike the first time Guzm\u00e1n escaped from prison, he became sloppy the second time around. After his daring breakout in 2015, the drug lord seemed to become almost delusional.\n\n\"He became drunk on his own wine,\" said Peter Vincent, a senior official and legal adviser of both the Justice Department and Homeland Security during the international manhunt for Guzm\u00e1n. \"He started to believe the hype that he was special, that he was almost a demigod, that he was something truly magical. And he became so incredibly arrogant that he thought he was untouchable.\"\n\nHe wasn't. Only 20 days after his escape, the Mexican marines had picked up on Guzm\u00e1n's trail.\n\nIntelligence tracked him to a house in the coastal town of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. Wiretap intercepts picked up on a visit planned by \"grandma and aunt\"\u2014code names for Guzm\u00e1n and his lieutenant. Then, \"grandma\" finally showed up. As an assault force moved into position, an armored truck left to go pick up food for a party.\n\n\"For an incredibly savvy, clever, almost a criminal genius that El Chapo Guzm\u00e1n was, he ultimately was done in by very simple tastes: tacos, tequila, and chicas,\" Vincent said.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n was arrested again. Mexican federal police took him to a motel instead of jail \u2014 a move Vincent said indicates that Guzm\u00e1n had likely threatened his captors. But the Mexican marines appeared and apprehended Guzm\u00e1n for a last time, flying him to Mexico City for booking.\n\nThe trial began in November, and jurors deliberated for more than 30 hours over six days before reaching their verdict.

The number includes sexual abuse accusations made against 301 priests over 70 years that a Pennsylvania grand jury revealed last summer.\n\nSince then, individual dioceses and archdioceses across the country have been reviewing their files and releasing lists of people who they said face credible allegations of abuse. The issue has prompted Pope Francis to call church leaders from all over the world to the Vatican for a summit that started Thursday.\n\nBetween the release of the Pennsylvania grand jury investigation on Aug. 14, and Monday of this week, dioceses in two states have each named more than 300 people who have been accused of abuse. In New York, dioceses have named a total of 343 people, and Texas dioceses have named 304.\n\nDioceses in 31 other states and Washington, D.C., have come forward with what they said they've found in their files. The findings range from Mississippi, where the diocese of Biloxi said in January that credible allegations have been made against three priests since 1989, to California, where the diocese of Oakland on Monday released a list of 45 clergy members accused of abuse dating back to the 1960s.\n\nCatholic bishops in the Netherlands covered up church sex abuse for decades, reports say\n\nNot all of the people who have been named are still alive. For example, 14 of the priests on the Oakland diocese's list are dead.\n\nIn all, 96 dioceses have released lists of alleged abusers in the past six months. That's more than half of the 178 archdioceses and dioceses across the country, according to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nNot all recently revealed allegations against priests have stemmed from the dioceses. In South Dakota, a priest from India serving in the diocese of Rapid City pleaded guilty earlier this month to having sexual contact with a 13-year-old girl.\n\nMeanwhile, dioceses in 16 states \u2014 Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming \u2014 have released no new information in the past six months. Some dioceses have said they're working with law enforcement agencies, and others released information on allegations before last August.\n\nStill other dioceses are continuing to review their files, raising the possibility that more allegations of abuse will surface in the future."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/napa-county-california-sheriff-releases-graphic-body-cam-video-of-deputy-fatally-shooting-suspect/", "text": "Napa County Sheriff's investigators released a stunning bodycam video Wednesday of a fatal weekend deputy-involved shooting of an armed suspect on a rural roadway.

Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.\n\nIn a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett \"enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.\"\n\nThe announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.\n\nInvestigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected.

He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled \"This is MAGA country\" - an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\" - before fleeing.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett \"continues to be a consummate professional on set\" and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.\n\nThe studio's statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation.\n\nWhispers about Smollett's potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.\n\nDetectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.\n\nThe brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola \"Abel\" and Olabinjo \"Ola\" Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.\n\nThe day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had \"shifted the trajectory of the investigation,\" and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.\n\nPolice said one of the men had appeared on \"Empire,\" and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, \"Sum of My Music,\" last year.\n\nSmollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to \"lock in their testimony.\"\n\nSpeaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers' attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.\n\n\"There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we're going to correct this,\" Gloria Schmidt said.\n\nShe said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. \"You don't need immunity when you have the truth,\" she said.\n\nShe also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.\n\nSmollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nReferring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that \"it doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nBut several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.\n\nFormer Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.\n\nSmollett has a record - one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.\n\nAnother prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.\n\nThe size of the tab is anyone's guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/haverstraw-rockland-county-ny-car-rams-family-8-backs-up-does-it-again/", "text": "Haverstraw, N.Y. -- A 32-year-old mother was killed and the rest of her family was rushed to the hospital Wednesday after a driver deliberately plowed into them outside a convenience store in a northern New York City suburb, CBS New York reports.

Former Acting Director Andrew McCabe is about to describe behind-the-scenes chaos in 2017, after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. In the days that followed, McCabe says that law enforcement officials discussed whether to secretly record a conversation with the president and whether Mr. Trump could be removed from office through invoking the 25th Amendment. McCabe is the first person present in those meetings to describe them publicly.\n\nMcCabe is a lifelong Republican who had a sterling 21-year career at the FBI; serving as head of counter-terrorism and number two under Comey. But he was fired last year for allegedly lying to his own agents about a story he leaked to a newspaper. Not since Watergate has the FBI been drawn so deeply into presidential politics. Andrew McCabe was pulled into the center of the tempest on May 9, 2017 when he was summoned by the president hours after Comey was fired.\n\n\"I was speaking to the man who had just... won the election for the presidency and who might have done so with the aid of the government of Russia, our most formidable adversary on the world stage.\"\n\nAndrew McCabe: I'd never been to a meeting in the Oval Office before. I'm a career FBI agent-government worker.\n\nScott Pelley: Oval Office was above your pay grade.\n\nAndrew McCabe: It certainly was. And the president immediately went off on a almost a gleeful description of what had happened with the firing of Jim Comey. And then he went on to state that people in the FBI were \u2014 were thrilled about this, that people really disliked Jim Comey and that they were very happy about this and that it was, it was a great thing.\n\nScott Pelley: He was telling you what the reaction inside the FBI was?\n\nAndrew McCabe: He was. It was very different than the reaction I had seen immediately before I came to the White House.\n\nAndrew McCabe\n\nScott Pelley: Which was what?\n\nAndrew McCabe: People were shocked. We had lost our leader, a leader who was respected and liked by the vast majority of FBI employees. People were very sad. But anyway, that night in the Oval Office what I was hearing from the president was, not reality. It was the version of the events that I quickly realized he wished me to adopt. As he went on talking about how happy people in the FBI were, he said to me, \"I heard that you were part of the resistance.\"\n\nScott Pelley: What did he mean by that?\n\nAndrew McCabe: Well I didn't know. And so I asked him. And he said, \"I heard that you were one of the people that did not support Jim Comey. You didn't agree with him and the decisions that he'd made in the Clinton case. And is that true?\" And I said, \"No sir. That's not true. I worked very closely with Jim Comey. I was a part of that team and a part of those decisions.\"\n\nScott Pelley: You had the sense you'd given him the wrong answer.\n\nAndrew McCabe: I knew I'd given him the wrong answer.\n\nScott Pelley: You weren't trying to hang onto this job.\n\nAndrew McCabe: I wasn't willing to lie to keep it. I didn't know when I'd be out of the job. I thought it would probably be pretty soon. And so I just put my head down and got to work trying to stabilize the people around me and do the things that I felt we needed to do with the Russia investigation, getting cases opened and getting a special counsel appointed.\n\nAfter firing Comey, Trump calls McCabe about FBI plane use\n\nAfter Comey was fired, McCabe says he ordered two investigations of the president himself. They asked two questions. One, did Mr. Trump fire Comey to impede the investigation into whether Russia interfered with the election. And two, if so, was Mr. Trump acting on behalf of the Russian government.\n\nAndrew McCabe: I was speaking to the man who had just run for the presidency and won the election for the presidency and who might have done so with the aid of the government of Russia, our most formidable adversary on the world stage. And that was something that troubled me greatly.\n\nScott Pelley: How long was it after that that you decided to start the obstruction of justice and counterintelligence investigations involving the president?\n\nAndrew McCabe: I think the next day, I met with the team investigating the Russia cases. And I asked the team to go back and conduct an assessment to determine where are we with these efforts and what steps do we need to take going forward. I was very concerned that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground in an indelible fashion that were I removed quickly or reassigned or fired that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace.\n\nScott Pelley: You wanted a documentary record\u2014\n\nAndrew McCabe: That's right\u2014\n\nScott Pelley: \u2014That those investigations had begun because you feared that they would be made to go away.\n\nAndrew McCabe: That's exactly right.\n\nCorrespondent Scott Pelley with Andrew McCabe\n\nMcCabe says that the basis for both investigations was in Mr. Trump's own statements. First, Mr. Trump had asked FBI Director Comey to drop the investigation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts. Then, to justify firing Comey, Mr. Trump asked his deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, to write a memo listing the reasons Comey had to go. And according to McCabe, Mr. Trump made a request for that memo that came as a surprise.\n\nAndrew McCabe: Rod was concerned by his interactions with the president, who seemed to be very focused on firing the director and saying things like, \"Make sure you put Russia in your memo.\" That concerned Rod in the same way that it concerned me and the FBI investigators on the Russia case.\n\nIf Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein listed the Russia investigation in his memo to the White House, it could look like he was obstructing the Russia probe by suggesting Comey's firing. And by implication, it would give the president cover.\n\nScott Pelley: He didn't wanna put Russia in his memo.\n\nAndrew McCabe: He did not. He explained to the president that he did not need Russia in his memo. And the president responded, \"I understand that, I am asking you to put Russia in the memo anyway.\"\n\nWhen the memo justifying Comey's firing was made public, Russia was not in it. But, Mr. Trump made the connection anyway, telling NBC, then, Russian diplomats that the Russian investigation was among the reasons he fired Comey.\n\nAndrew McCabe: There were a number of things that caused us to believe that we had adequate predication or adequate reason and facts, to open the investigation. The president had been speaking in a derogatory way about our investigative efforts for weeks, describing it as a witch hunt\u2026\n\nPresident Trump on Feb. 16, 2017: Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years.\n\nAndrew McCabe: ...publicly undermining the effort of the investigation. The president had gone to Jim Comey and specifically asked him to discontinue the investigation of Mike Flynn which was a part of our Russia case. The president, then, fired the director. In the firing of the director, the president specifically asked Rod Rosenstein to write the memo justifying the firing and told Rod to include Russia in the memo. Rod, of course, did not do that. That was on the president's mind. Then, the president made those public comments that you've referenced both on NBC and to the Russians which was captured in the Oval Office. Put together, these circumstances were articulable facts that indicated that a crime may have been committed. The president may have been engaged in obstruction of justice in the firing of Jim Comey.\n\nScott Pelley: What was it specifically that caused you to launch the counterintelligence investigation?\n\nAndrew McCabe: It's many of those same concerns that cause us to be concerned about a national security threat. And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia's malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, \"Why would a president of the United States do that?\" So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?\n\nScott Pelley: Are you saying that the president is in league with the Russians?\n\nAndrew McCabe: I'm saying that the FBI had reason to investigate that. Right, to investigate the existence of an investigation doesn't mean someone is guilty. I would say, Scott, if we failed to open an investigation under those circumstances, we wouldn't be doing our jobs.\n\nScott Pelley: When you decided to launch these two investigations, was the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, onboard with that.\n\nAndrew McCabe: Absolutely.\n\nCalling Comey? McCabe says Rosenstein wanted Comey's advice\n\nRod Rosenstein has spent 28 years at the Department of Justice. A Republican, he was appointed by President Trump as deputy attorney general, number two at the department. Mr. Trump's firing of James Comey on May 9, 2017 set off a week of crisis meetings between Rosenstein, who was in charge of the Russia investigation and acting FBI director Andrew McCabe.\n\nAndrew McCabe: I can't describe to you accurately enough the pressure and the chaos that Rod and I were trying to operate under at that time. It was incredibly turbulent, incredibly stressful. And it was clear to me that that stress was\u2014 was impacting the deputy attorney general. We talked about why the president had insisted on firing the director and whether or not he was thinking about the Russia investigation and did that impact his decision. And in the context of that conversation, the deputy attorney general offered to wear a wire into the White House. He said, \"I never get searched when I go into the White House. I could easily wear a recording device. They wouldn't know it was there.\" Now, he was not joking. He was absolutely serious. And in fact, he brought it up in the next meeting we had. I never actually considered taking him up on the offer. I did discuss it with my general counsel and my leadership team back at the FBI after he brought it up the first time.\n\nScott Pelley: The point of Rosenstein wearing the wire into a meeting with the president was what? What did he hope to obtain?\n\nAndrew McCabe: I can't characterize what Rod was thinking or what he was hoping at that moment. But the reason you would have someone wear a concealed recording device would be to collect evidence and in this case, what was the true nature of the president's motivation in calling for the firing of Jim Comey?\n\nScott Pelley: The general counsel of the FBI and the leadership team you spoke with said what about this idea?\n\nAndrew McCabe: I think the general counsel had a heart attack. And when he got up off the floor, he said, \"I, I, that's a bridge too far. We're not there yet.\"\n\nScott Pelley: That it wasn't necessary at that point in the investigation to escalate it to that level.\n\nAndrew McCabe: That's correct.\n\nBut McCabe says Rosenstein raised another idea. The 25th Amendment to the constitution allows the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to remove the president.\n\nAndrew McCabe: Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply, Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort. I didn't have much to contribute, to be perfectly honest, in that\u2014 conversation. So I listened to what he had to say. But, to be fair, it was an unbelievably stressful time. I can't even describe for you how many things must have been coursing through the deputy attorney general's mind at that point. So it was really something that he kinda threw out in a very frenzied chaotic conversation about where we were and what we needed to do next.\n\nScott Pelley: What seemed to be coursing through the mind of the deputy attorney general was getting rid of the president of the United States\n\nAndrew McCabe: Well\u2014\n\nPelley: One way or another.\n\nAndrew McCabe: I can't confirm that. But what I can say is the deputy attorney general was definitely very concerned about the president, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.\n\nScott Pelley: How did he bring up the idea of the 25th amendment to you?\n\nAndrew McCabe: Honestly, I don't remember. He, it was just another kinda topic that he jumped to in the midst of a wide-ranging conversation.\n\nScott Pelley: Seriously? (LAUGH) Just\u2014\n\nAndrew McCabe: Yeah\u2014\n\nScott Pelley: \u2014another topic\n\nAndrew McCabe: Yeah.\n\nScott Pelley: Did you counsel him on that?\n\nAndrew McCabe: I didn't. I mean, he was discussing other cabinet members and whether or not people would support such an idea, whether or not other cabinet members would, shared, his belief that the president was \u2014 was really concerning, was concerning Rod at that time.\n\nScott Pelley: Rosenstein was actually openly talking about whether there was a majority of the cabinet who would vote to remove the president.\n\nAndrew McCabe: That's correct. Counting votes or possible votes.\n\nScott Pelley: Did he assign specific votes to specific people?\n\nAndrew McCabe: No, not that I recall.\n\nScott Pelley: As you're sitting in this meeting in the Justice Department, talking about removing the president of the United States, you were thinking what?\n\nAndrew McCabe: How did I get here? Confronting these confounding legal issues of such immense importance, not just to the FBI but to the entire country, it was\u2014 it was disorienting.\n\n\"The president replied, 'I don't care. I believe Putin.'\"\n\nIn response to our interview, the Justice Department gave us a carefully worded statement. It says McCabe's story is \"inaccurate and factually incorrect.\" \"The deputy attorney general never authorized any recording\" [of the president.] \"Nor was the deputy attorney general in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment.\"\n\nMcCabe told us, as the weeks wore on, the president continued to express what McCabe thought was a strange affinity for russia. He remembers a day when an FBI official returned from the White House to brief McCabe on the results of a meeting with the president.\n\nAndrew McCabe: The president\u2014 launched into\u2014 several unrelated diatribes. One of those was commenting on the recent missile launches by the government of North Korea. And, essentially, the president said he did not believe that the North Koreans had the capability to hit us here with ballistic missiles in the United States. And he did not believe that because President Putin had told him they did not. President Putin had told him that the North Koreans don't actually have those missiles.\n\nScott Pelley: And U.S. intelligence was telling the president what?\n\nAndrew McCabe: Intelligence officials in the briefing responded that that was not consistent with any of the intelligence our government possesses, to which the president replied, \"I don't care. I believe Putin.\"\n\nScott Pelley: What did you think when you heard that?\n\nAndrew McCabe: It's just an astounding thing to say. To spend the time and effort and energy that we all do in the intelligence community to produce products that will help decision makers and the ultimate decision maker, the President of the United States\u2014 make policy decisions, and to be confronted with an absolute disbelief in those efforts and a unwillingness to learn the true state of affairs that he has to deal with every day was just shocking.\n\nMcCabe wouldn't have much time to be shocked. His FBI career soon spiraled to its destruction.\n\nAndrew McCabe's FBI job interview with President Trump\n\nThe FBI's perilous proximity to presidential politics began with the investigation into whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used an unsecured server for classified emails. Later, the FBI launched its investigation into Russian interference in the election. For Andrew McCabe, the former acting director of the FBI, an investigation involving politics would destroy his career and damage his credibility after he allegedly lied about an FBI leak to a newspaper.\n\nIt was a turn of events that began when candidate Donald Trump unexpectedly took aim at McCabe's wife.\n\nDr. Jill McCabe, an emergency room pediatrician, dabbled briefly in politics back in 2015 when she ran for state office in Virginia. Like other Democratic candidates that year, she was funded by a political action committee controlled by Virginia's governor, a friend of the Clintons.\n\nScott Pelley: During the time that Jill was running for office, what responsibilities did you have at the FBI over the Clinton investigations?\n\nAndrew McCabe: None. I was not at headquarters where the case was initiated and run. I was in the field office.\n\nJill McCabe: There was no connection in any way between my campaign and Bill and Hillary Clinton. I've never met them. I don't know them.\n\nBut in the closing days of the 2016 presidential campaign, The Wall Street Journal ran an article headlined \"Clinton Ally Aided FBI Wife.\" It was about Jill McCabe's funding the year before. The article noted, accurately, that her husband's role in the Clinton email investigation began months after she lost. But candidate Donald Trump seemed to conflate the two.\n\nPresident Trump at Rally: It was just learned that one of the closest people to Hillary Clinton with long-standing ties to her husband and herself\u2026 gave more than $675,000 to the campaign of the spouse, the wife, of the top FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's illegal email server.\n\nScott Pelley: How do you feel when you see that?\n\nJill McCabe: Sick. Sick to my stomach.\n\nAndrew McCabe: I think sickening is the right word. It's disgusting. To see the candidate for the presidency taking those lies and manipulating them for his own advantage, and then to hear you know, the chants and the boos of thousands of people who are just accepting those lies at face value, it's chilling.\n\nJill and Andrew McCabe\n\nThree months after Jill McCabe lost the election, Andrew McCabe was promoted to deputy director, number two under James Comey. Nine months after that, because of his wife's campaign, he recused himself from the Clinton Investigations. Then President Trump fired Comey and McCabe became acting director. In one of their first conversations, McCabe says, Mr. Trump asked about his wife.\n\nAndrew McCabe: \"What was it like when your wife lost her race for state senate? It must have been really tough to lose.\" And I said, \"Well, it's tough to lose anything. But my wife has refocused her efforts on her career. And he then said, \"Ask her what it was like to lose. It must be tough to be a loser.\"\n\nScott Pelley: What did you think?\n\nAndrew McCabe: No man wants to hear anyone call his wife a loser, most of all me. My wife is a wonderful, brilliant, dedicated physician who tried to help her community. So she is no loser. It was just bullying. So rather than get into an argument with the president of the United States, we, I said, \"Okay, sir.\" And we hung up and ended the call.\n\nThat was the crisis week, after Comey was fired, when McCabe argued for an independent counsel to take over the investigations of the president.\n\nAndrew McCabe: I knew from past experience with the Clinton case how dangerous, how perilous it was for the FBI to be investigating now not just a candidate for the presidency but the president, himself. This was a situation that clearly called for the appointment of a special counsel who would bring a level of independence. And that's the argument I made to the deputy attorney general.\n\nPelley calls Andrew McCabe interview \"astonishing\"\n\nThe deputy attorney general is Rod Rosenstein, a career federal prosecutor who Mr. Trump appointed to the number two job at the Justice Department. McCabe says it was Rosenstein who offered to wear a wire into the White House and Rosenstein who initially resisted appointing a special counsel.\n\nAndrew McCabe: He was concerned of what would happen to him if he appointed the special counsel, that if he did it might mean that he would lose his job. And, then, we would no longer have a Senate-confirmed official at the Justice Department to oversee all these efforts.\n\nEight days after Comey was fired, Rosenstein appointed special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller had been a career prosecutor who was appointed FBI director by George W. Bush. So far, Mueller has obtained public indictments, convictions, or guilty pleas involving six Trump campaign associates, including the campaign chairman, plus 25 Russian intelligence agents.\n\nAndrew McCabe: We survived those crazy days in the wake of Jim Comey's firing. You know, we got to the point of having a new director appointed and confirmed, we got the cases opened that we needed opened, we got the special counsel and probably the best special counsel we possibly could have hoped for in charge of an investigation that I think everyone would admit is one of the most important efforts underway right now.\n\nBut if McCabe had navigated the crisis around President Trump, he would not survive a controversy involving Hillary Clinton. About a week before election day, McCabe authorized the leak of a story to The Wall Street Journal. At this time, he was still deputy director under Comey. The resulting story said that McCabe had defended the FBI investigating the Clinton Charitable Foundation after a Justice Department official had cast doubt on that investigation.\n\nScott Pelley: You are accused of providing information to a Wall Street Journal reporter because you thought the story the Journal was writing was going to be wrong. Do I have that right?\n\nAndrew McCabe: That's correct.\n\nScott Pelley: You are authorized by the FBI to release information to the media.\n\nAndrew McCabe: That's correct.\n\nScott Pelley: You did so through the public affairs office at the FBI.\n\nAndrew McCabe: I did.\n\nThe Journal attributed the story to an unnamed source. And it seemed like a garden-variety leak of the kind that happens every day. But, according to a detailed investigation by the Justice Department inspector general, McCabe lied under oath three times when investigators asked if he was the source the inspector general concluded that mccabe leaked the story only to make himself look good, which would violate FBI regulations. McCabe says correcting a story that he believed would be in error was in the public interest. As for lying, McCabe told us he was confused by the investigators' questions and distracted by the Comey crisis.\n\nAndrew McCabe: There's absolutely no reason for anyone and certainly not for me to misrepresent what happened. So no. Did I ever intentionally mislead the people I spoke to? I did not. I had no reason to. And I did not.\n\nIf the inspector general is right, about McCabe lying, this would be another Washington story of an embarrassing matter made lethal by a coverup. President Trump weighed in, tweeting, \"FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 Days to go?!!!\"\n\nScott Pelley: Did you expect to be fired 26 hours before you were able to collect your pension?\n\nAndrew McCabe: I guess I should have because the president spoke about it publicly. He made it quite clear that he wanted me gone before I could retire. I believe I was fired because I opened a case against the president of the United States.\n\nScott Pelley: The president tweeted, \"Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for\u2026 the FBI \u2014 A great day for Democracy.\"\n\nAndrew McCabe: The idea that this president would know what a great day for the FBI or a great day for democracy was is preposterous.\n\nMcCabe is considering whether to sue the government to get his full pension. Prosecutors are considering whether to charge him with lying to the FBI, a crime which, worst case, could bring five years in prison on each count.\n\nMcCabe has written a new book about the campaign crisis and his 21-year career. Entitled, \"The Threat \u2014 How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump.\"\n\nWe asked the White House for comment on McCabe's specific claims, but we received a general reply, \"Andrew McCabe was fired in disgrace from the FBI for lying, and he opened a completely baseless investigation into the president \u2014 everyone knows he has no credibility.\"\n\nScott Pelley: You seem to have a very clear memory of your conversations with the president. Why so?\n\nAndrew McCabe: I made memorandums to myself to make sure that I preserved my contemporaneous recollections of those interactions.\n\nScott Pelley: That's what FBI agents are trained to do, write memos to the file after they speak to witnesses.\n\nAndrew McCabe: That's what we're trained to do.\n\nScott Pelley: And where are those memos today?\n\nAndrew McCabe: Those memos are in the custody of the special counsel's team.\n\nScott Pelley: Robert Mueller's team\u2014\n\nAndrew McCabe: That's correct.\n\nScott Pelley: \u2014has your memos.\n\nAndrew McCabe: He does.\n\nProduced by Pat Milton, Robert G.

And not just your daughter, but hundreds of girls in your town taken in the night. The families of Chibok, Nigeria lived through that nightmare almost five years ago when the Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram - whose name roughly translates to \"western education is forbidden\" - attacked a local school and ran off with 276 girls. Some escaped, but it took the Nigerian government three years to negotiate the release of fewer than half of them.\n\nSince their release, the Chibok girls, as they're known, have been largely hidden from the public. But we were able to meet with them at a kind of prep school to hear their remarkable story of survival.\n\nThe girls in captivity\n\nThis is a hostage video released by Boko Haram from their hide-out in the Sambisa Forest, one month after the kidnapping.\n\nThe Chibok girls are all covered, chanting verses from the Quran.\n\nThey were facing a life of misery with beatings and starvation.\n\nBut now at the New Foundation School on the campus of the American University of Nigeria, the girls are singing again.\n\nThis time it's the Christian songs they grew up with.\n\nRebecca: We are the Chibok girls that have been in captivities and now we are alive.\n\nGetting out alive and singing hymns, things Rebecca feared might never happen.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did they let you sing when you were in captivity?\n\nRebecca: No. We are singing in private\u2014\n\nLesley Stahl: Private.\n\nRebecca: They won't allow us to sing like that.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you had to whisper sing?\n\nRebecca: Yes.\n\nFor Rebecca and her friends, just singing out loud today is a gift, after their three years of living in fear and pressure to become Muslims.\n\nLesley Stahl: So if you didn't convert to Islam, were you punished for not converting?\n\nRebecca\n\nRebecca: Yes, they say if you didn't convert to Islam you wouldn't get home alive. That's what they say.\n\nHere are some of the girls two years ago right after they were released, alive but looking like concentration camp survivors, haunted and numb. This is Rebecca, skin and bones.\n\nLesley Stahl: I heard you were eating grass.\n\nRebecca: Yeah. Some of us eat that. And we are just be patient and live like that. No food. No anything.\n\nLook at them today, in their 20s. They're healthy and full of spirit at a school created just for them, paid for by the Nigerian government and some donors, where they are making up for lost time.\n\nThey're from Northern Nigeria, where life can be hard and opportunities for women are limited. Now, in their Wi-Fi-equipped dorms, they have smart phones, and lap tops and their own beds.\n\nThey go back to Chibok to see their parents twice a year; over Christmas and during the summer.\n\nBeyond the Chibok girls: Inside Nigeria's IDP camps\n\nOtherwise, they work hard here, going to class six days a week, studying subjects like biology and math. Working toward getting into the university, which would for them be free of charge.\n\nMost of the girls we spoke to were shy. And reticent as they told us that their tight bond, going back to Chibok, helped them survive. When Grace's leg was injured the night of the kidnapping, her \"sisters,\" as she calls them, Ayesha and Maryam and others pulled her through.\n\nGrace: They are taking care of me. They are fetching water. They are washing me, my clothes, and everything.\n\nAyeisha: We are worried about her leg. We don't have anybody there that will take care of her. Only us.\n\nLesley Stahl: You helped each other, sick, or unhappy, or scared, you were a unit.\n\nAyeisha: Yes.\n\nSomiari Demm: They just had an unbelievable bond, and an attachment to each other.\n\nSomiari Demm is the girls' therapist, on call 24/7. Born in Nigeria, raised and educated in the states, she has been with this group since they arrived over a year ago.\n\nLesley Stahl: Can you tell us what their experiences were like generally?\n\nSomiari Demm: Just a lot of the stuff, the starvation\u2026\n\nLesley Stahl: They ate grass.\n\nSomiari Demm: Eating grass, exactly, the beatings,-- being forced to get married. At some point in time, you know, the bomb, the air strikes. So these are some of things that were reoccurring events.\n\nLesley Stahl: For three years.\n\nSomiari Demm: For three years. Yeah.\n\nSomiari Demm puts her arm around a student\n\nLesley Stahl: You were actually hit.\n\nThe air strikes started as the Nigerian government pursued and attacked Boko Haram.\n\nLesley Stahl: A bomb dropped where you were being held.\n\nRebecca: They mistakenly throw the bomb.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you were injured?\n\nRebecca: With some particles.\n\nLesley Stahl: Shrapnel?\n\nRebecca: Yeah and it's still inside my body. It has not been removed.\n\nBecause the shrapnel is in her liver, she's in pain. But she perserveres at school.\n\nLesley Stahl: You were kidnapped because you went to school. Now you're back in school. Do you feel like you're doing something courageous?\n\nRebecca: Even what happened with me will not stop me doing what I already desire in my mind.\n\nReginald Braggs, an American, has also been at the New Foundation School since its start.\n\nA former naval officer turned college administrator, Braggs runs the school and designed the educational program.\n\nReginald Braggs\n\nLesley Stahl: What is the biggest challenge for you in this program?\n\nReginald Braggs: You know, it really is trying to help the students to meet their goal of getting into the university. And part of that challenge is their English language proficiency. So I had this idea, I said let's do an old-fashioned, American spelling bee with these guys.\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Orange\n\nGIRL: O-R-A-N-G-E\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Correct! (cheers)\n\nSometimes one of them struggles, over even an easy word like poor...\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Poor\n\nGIRL: P-U-T\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Wrong! (whistle)\n\n...and is embarrassed. But when someone like rebecca gets a hard word right\u2026\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Assembly\n\nRebecca: A-S-S-E-M-B-L-Y\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Correct! (cheers)\n\n...a roar goes up.\n\nReginald Braggs: It's amazing how their confidence grows after this.\n\nLesley Stahl: You've seen a progression.\n\nReginald Braggs: Oh absolutely, absolutely.\n\nLesley Stahl: But do you think there's a lot of pressure on them in the spelling bee?\n\nReginald Braggs: Yes, of course.\n\nLesley Stahl: That's okay?\n\nReginald Braggs: Of course. This is about education for them, and knowing that they can do something. And it's always better when you have someone who is confident and they're doing something and the other students are observing them. If they can do it, you can do it.\n\nIt's not as easy as having a can-do attitude for these girls, says Demm. She thinks they're being pushed too hard and that the curriculum is too rigourous.\n\nSomiari Demm: I think at times, we need to kinda scale it back. Trauma really changes the brain whether memory, cognition, recall, retrieval. We have to meet them where they are. If not, all we're doing is making the situation worse.\n\nWe were told they still get flashbacks and night terrors. And it doesn't help that over 100 of their friends are still missing.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think about the ones who are still in captivity?\n\nGrace: When I think about them, I'm crying. And, I know that place. I know the condition. I don't want my sisters to stay there. I want them to come out.\n\nDemm is using an array of theraputic treatments to help them heal.\n\nShe leads them in yoga and relaxation exercises. And provides individual and group therapy where most of the girls have had difficulty talking about the suffering they endured.\n\nLesley Stahl: Can you tell us just a little bit about what life was like in captivity.\n\nRebecca: (Sigh.)\n\nLesley Stahl: Is it too hard to talk about?\n\nRebecca: Yeah, because I don't want to remember some things. When I tried, maybe I will feel like crying like that.\n\nBut her sisters share her memories.\n\nThe idea here is that the trauma happened in a group, so it's good to do the healing in a group.\n\nDemm says she never pushes the girls to open up. So, for instance, she doesn't know how many were raped. But she says there's a fine line between rape and forced marriage.\n\nLesley Stahl: You got married?\n\nMaryam: Yes.\n\nMaryam wasn't forced to convert, she was already Muslim so she was quickly married off to a Boko Haram commander and got pregnant.\n\nLesley Stahl: You gave birth there in the forest?\n\nMaryam: Yes.\n\nShe said the birth was difficult, but her son, Ali, was healthy. After two years, her Boko Haram husband actually helped her and Ali escape.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you feel still that you're married\n\nMaryam: No.\n\nAnd Ali, now two and a half. Where is he? He's in Chibok with his grandparents. The New Foundation School decided babies wouldn't be allowed on campus.\n\nLesley Stahl: Would you like it if they let you have the baby here?\n\nMaryam: Yes, I like it. But, you know, it can't be possible to carry Ali here.\n\nLesley Stahl: What does he call you?\n\nMaryam: Maryam. (LAUGH)\n\nShe's been separated from her son for so long he doesn't recognize her as his mother. As a child of Boko Haram, Ali is likely to face difficult odds, but Maryam feels that with a good education she can ease the way for him.\n\nThe Nigerian government is paying for most of their schooling. But thousands of other women and girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram are languishing with other victims in government-run camps like this one we found just 30 minutes from the school.\n\nThe contrast with the Chibok girls at the New Foundation School is glaring. But their free education comes with the burden of great expectations. The school's walls are plastered with sayings like: there's no limit to what I can achieve; their dorms are named after successful women like Michelle Obama and Malala.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you feel that because you're getting this wonderful education free, that you need to give something back to your country?\n\nGrace: If I work hard and if I become something, it's not only this Nigeria, I will help many countries.\n\nLesley Stahl: You'll be like Malala.\n\nGrace: Yes! Maybe I will do more than her. (LAUGH)\n\nDawn Dekle, president of the American University of Nigeria, says the New Foundation School is grooming these young women to \"give back\" by becoming leaders.\n\nDawn Dekle: The best revenge is massive success. And I really think these young women are gonna be some senators, some governors. Some of these young women wanna join the military. They told me, they wanna be a general in the military and go get Boko Haram so they can't do this to any other young girls.\n\nIt is ironic that their worst experience \u2013 has led to opportunities beyond their wildest dreams.

The transcript of the story is below.\n\nNow, an extraordinary story from the Second World War -- a humanitarian story that didn't come to light for decades. It concerns a young Londoner named Nicholas Winton who went to Prague, and ended up saving the lives of 669 children, mostly Jews, from almost certain death. His story begins at the end of 1938, with Europe on the brink of war. In Germany, violence against Jews was escalating and the infamous Munich Agreement paved the way for Hitler's armies to march unopposed into Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe things she carried\n\nIn London, Nicholas Winton had been following events and knew that refugees fleeing the Nazis were in dire straits. He went to Czechoslovakia to see if there was anything he could do to help. What's strange is that for almost 50 years, he hardly told anyone about what he had accomplished and for 50 years, the children knew nothing about who had saved them or how.\n\nWe begin on October 1st, 1938. Nazi troops marched into the Sudetenland, the German-speaking region of Czechoslovakia. Prague, the Czech capital was flooded with desperate people, trying to escape. A fortunate few were able to send their children abroad. These parents, mostly Czech Jews, sensed war was coming and wanted to get their children out. By chance, a cameraman filmed a man holding a boy, a 29-year-old Londoner. His name: Nicholas Winton.\n\nNicholas Winton: All I knew was that the people that I met couldn't get out. And they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out.\n\nNicholas Winton is one of the few people who can bear witness to those days because he's 104 years old. He told us he went to Prague to see if he might be able to save some people.\n\nBob Simon: What made you think you could do it?\n\nNicholas Winton: I work on the motto that if something's not impossible, there must be a way of doing it.\n\nBack in London, Winton was a successful stockbroker -- living the good life, with a passion for sports. But he was deeply concerned about news reports from Czechoslovakia, of \"German persecution.\"\n\nNicholas Winton: I went out into the camps where the people who had been displaced were put. And it was winter. And it was cold.\n\nEmigration wasn't an option. The world's doors were closed to refugees. Conditions in the camps were brutal for the 150,000 people trapped there, especially for the children. And no one focused on them until Nicholas Winton.\n\n\"I work on the motto that if something's not impossible, there must be a way of doing it.\"\n\n\n\nBut what did he do? We went to Jerusalem, to Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, and asked Dr. David Silberklang, a senior historian there.\n\nDavid Silberklang: Winton went set up shop in a hotel in the center of the old city in Prague, and began looking into, \"How can I organize getting some of these refugees, particularly the children, out of here?\"\n\nBob Simon: What kind of experience did he have to qualify him for this immense bureaucratic task?\n\nDavid Silberklang: None!\n\nWinton set up a small organization with one aim: to get as many kids out, as fast as possible.\n\nDavid Silberklang: People started coming to him in increasing numbers. He didn't have time in the day to meet them all. He'd work till 2:00 in the morning; get up early in the morning to meet the next people as more and more were coming saying, \"Take my child. Take my child.\"\n\nBy the time he returned to London, he had a list of hundreds of children and set out to convince British authorities to take him seriously. He did it by taking stationary from an established refugee organization, adding \"Children's Section,\" and making himself chairman.\n\nNicholas Winton: So that eventually they had to adopt me.\n\nBob Simon: So, in fact, you managed to do what you did through a little deception, a little smoke and mirrors?\n\nNicholas Winton: Yes, to a certain extent, yes.\n\nBob Simon: It required quite a bit of ingenuity.\n\nNicholas Winton: No, it just required a printing press to get the notepaper printed.\n\nThe \"Children's Section\" operated from a tiny office in central London. Winton's mother was in charge. The staff were all volunteers. During the day, Winton worked as a stockbroker. Evenings, he wrestled with the British bureaucracy.\n\nBob Simon: Did you approach any other countries to take some of the children?\n\nNicholas Winton: The Americans. But the Americans wouldn't take any, which was a pity. We could've got a lot more out.\n\nWinton had written President Roosevelt, asking the U.S. to take in more children. A minor official at the U.S. Embassy in London wrote back -- the U.S. was \"unable\" to help. Britain agreed to accept the children, but only if Winton found families willing to take them in. So he circulated the children's pictures to advertise them. But even after a family chose a child, British authorities were slow in issuing travel documents. So Winton started having them forged. He also spread some money around.\n\nNicholas Winton: Took a bit of blackmail on my part.\n\nBob Simon: You were indulging in blackmail and forgery to get the children out?\n\nNicholas Winton: I've never heard it put like that before.\n\nBob Simon: But you seem to be enjoying it.\n\nNicholas Winton: It worked. That's the main thing.\n\nThe first 20 children left Prague on March 14, 1939.\n\nThe next day, German troops occupied Prague and the rest of Czechoslovakia. Hitler rode through the streets triumphant. Hugo Meisl was 10 years old.\n\nBob Simon: Do you remember the Germans coming into Czechoslovakia?\n\nHugo Meisl: Not only do I remember, I personally saw Hitler standing up in the car. And the children were expected to say, \"Heil Hitler,\" and so forth. I remember as if it was yesterday.\n\nIt wasn't long before violence against Jews, property confiscations and forced labor that began in the Sudetenland spread throughout Czechoslovakia. But the Nazis allowed Winton's trains to leave - in keeping with their policy to \"cleanse\" Europe of Jews. Hugo Meisl's parents decided it was time to put him and his brother on one of the trains.\n\nTo learn more about the Kindertransports, Kinder and their descendants today, please see www.kindertransport.org\n\nHugo Meisl: I remember that they told us that we were going to England maybe two or three months. It would be a holiday for us. And that they would join us very shortly thereafter--\n\nBob Simon: And you believed them.\n\nHugo Meisl: Absolutely.\n\nBob Simon: Were your parents emotional when they said goodbye to you?\n\nHugo Meisl: No, I re-- I-- I-- I've asked myself that question many times. How my parents had the strength (chokes up), I'm sorry. It never occurred to me that what they were saying to us was not true. In other words, that they realized that they would not be joining us within a short period of time.\n\nOver the spring and summer of 1939, seven trains carried over 600 children through the heart of Nazi Germany to Holland, where they took a ferry to the English coast. From there, they caught a train to London.\n\nAn eighth train -- carrying 250 more -- was scheduled to leave Prague on September 1st. But that's the day the war began.\n\nNicholas Winton: They were all at the station. Even on the train, waiting to go, and war was declared. So the train never left. Never heard really what happened to all those children.\n\nBob Simon: But there's reason to suspect that not many of them survived?\n\nNicholas Winton: I think that's true. Yes.\n\nTwo years after that last train, the Nazis began implementing the \"Final Solution\" their plan to slaughter all the Jews of Europe. Czech Jews were rounded up and shipped to Theresienstadt, an old military garrison town about an hour north of Prague --- their first stop on the road to annihilation.\n\nThese tracks were the exit from Theresienstadt. The only exit. The tracks led east. The trains were called Polish Transports. Destination: Auschwitz. Some 90,000 people took that one-way ride. Among them almost all the children Sir Nicholas wasn't able to get out in time, their parents and the parents of the children already in England.\n\nBob Simon: After the war you went back to Czechoslovakia... Was there one instant where you accepted the fact that your parents were dead?\n\nHugo Meisl: For three years we used to visit when trains came from Siberia, especially when the Communists moved in in 1948, a lot of people started coming back from Siberia. So I would go to a station-- hoping. And films were being shown of people walking in concentration camps, Auschwitz and so forth, there were so many shots being taken by the Germans and-- and so forth-- never stopped looking.\n\nThe name of every Czech Jew murdered in the Holocaust is painted on the walls of Prague's Pinkas Synagogue. Over 77,300 names, including Arnoshtka and Pavel Meisl -- Hugo's parents.\n\nAnd Nicholas Winton? During the war he volunteered for an ambulance unit for the Red Cross, then trained pilots for the Royal Air Force. He got married, raised a family, earned a comfortable living. For 50 years, he told hardly anyone what he had done.\n\nBob Simon: A question which I know intrigues everyone who hears your story, is why did you keep it secret for so long?\n\nNicholas Winton: I didn't really keep it secret, I just didn't talk about it.\n\nBob Simon: All this this time you're in England and you go back to Czechoslovakia. Then you go to Israel. You still had no idea how your departure from Czechoslovakia had been organized?\n\nHugo Meisl: Absolutely no idea.\n\nBob Simon: And you learned that by seeing it on television?\n\nHugo Meisl: That's right.\n\nIn 1988, the BBC learned about Winton's story and invited him to be part of a program. He had no idea, that the people sitting around him were people he had saved.\n\nEster Rantzen: Can I ask, is there anyone in our audience tonight who owes their life to Nicholas Winton? If so, could you stand up please? Mr. Winton would you like to turn around. On behalf of all of them, thank you very much indeed.\n\nNicholas Winton: I suppose it was the most emotional moment of my life, suddenly being confronted with all these children who weren't by any means children anymore.\n\nBob Simon: No, they weren't. And for the first time, they looked at you and knew that you were the reason that they were alive.\n\nNicholas Winton: Yeah. True.\n\nLady Milena: I wore this around my neck. And this is the actual pass that we were given to come to England. And I am another of the children that you saved.\n\nLady Milena Grenfell-Baines describes Winton as one of the most modest people she has ever met.\n\nBob Simon: Why do you think he didn't say anything for 50 years?\n\nLady Milena: I think it's in his nature. He really felt that he'd done all he could, and having got those children settled he felt, \"Been there, done that, my job's done I've got other things to do.\"\n\n\"Other things.\" For the last 50 years, Winton's been helping mentally handicapped people and building homes for the elderly.\n\nNicholas Winton: We've just opened our second old people's home, and it's full. And it's doing very well. And there are plenty of old people like me to go in.\n\nBob Simon: Yes, but you're not there. You're at home.\n\nNicholas Winton: Oh, I'd hate to go into one of my own homes. Don't print that.\n\nIn 2003, Winton was knighted - and became Sir Nicholas Winton. In the Czech Republic, he's become a national hero. And he was celebrated in a documentary called \"Nicky's Family,\" but he isn't really comfortable with all the adulation.\n\nNicholas Winton: I'm not interested in the past. I think there's too much emphasis nowadays on the past and what has happened. And nobody is concentrated on the present and the future.\n\nIn 1939, Nicholas Winton used a two week vacation to go to Prague and ended up saving the lives of 669 children. In the decades since, of course, the children had children, who then had children and so on...and the numbers multiplied.\n\nBob Simon: If you wanna summarize it in one sentence: Guy takes a two week vacation...\n\nLady Milena: -- and ends up with 15,000 children?\n\nBob Simon: It's a pretty good story.\n\nLady Milena: It's a great story.\n\nNicholas Winton: They've got children and grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\nBob Simon: And none of them would be here if it hadn't been for Sir Nick.\n\nNicholas Winton: That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Terrible responsibility, isn't it?"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/howard-schultz-starbucks-ceo-considering-independent-run-for-president-60-minutes/", "text": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz left his company seven months ago which led many to wonder what the socially conscious executive was planning. To Schultz, Starbucks was never just a coffee shop. He saw his stores as meeting halls where customers came to chew over the great issues of the day. His activism is rooted in a rags-to-riches life. And tonight, Schultz reveals traumas he has never discussed publicly. At the age of 65, he is preparing for the greatest challenge of his life. Many believe that Schultz would run for president as a Democrat. His announcement tonight may come as a surprise.\n\n\"I wanna see the American people win. I wanna see America win.\"\n\nHoward Schultz: I am seriously thinking of running for president. I will run as a centrist independent, outside of the two-party system we're living at a most-fragile time not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people and are engaged, every single day, in revenge politics.\n\nScott Pelley: Why run as an Independent? Your views have always aligned with the Democratic Party.\n\nHoward Schultz: That's true. I've, you know, I've been a lifelong Democrat. I look at both parties-- we see extremes on both sides well, we are sitting, today, with approximately $21.5 trillion of debt, which is a reckless example, not only of Republicans, but of Democrats, as well, as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility.\n\nScott Pelley: Do you worry that you're going to siphon votes away from the Democrats and, thereby, ensure that President Trump has a second term?\n\nHoward Schultz: I wanna see the American people win. I wanna see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas. And I will be an independent person, who will embrace those ideas. Because I am not, in any way, in bed with a party.\n\nCorrespondent Scott Pelley speaks with Howard Schultz\n\nWe met with Howard Schultz this month in his adopted hometown of Seattle. It was here, in 1981 that he arrived as a stranger in the Pike Place Market to visit the original Starbucks, just a tiny store that sold coffee beans.\n\nScott Pelley: You were selling coffee makers, living in New York, and this was one of your customers. Why did you come out here to visit them?\n\nHoward Schultz: The thing is, I had never heard of Starbucks. And they were buying a ton of these products. And I just thought I gotta come to Seattle and see who this company was.\n\nHow he created the phenomenon we know is a story longer than the line at Starbucks. Suffice to say Schultz got a job behind this counter. He installed an espresso machine. And in 1987, with borrowed money, he bought the shop.\n\nScott Pelley: How many stores are there today?\n\nHoward Schultz: Almost 30,000 in 77 countries.\n\nA sweet success with a few bitter notes. Starbucks almost went broke in the 2007 financial crisis.\n\nAnd last year, a store manager set off a furor when she called police on African-American men who were just hanging out at a table. Schultz closed all the U.S. stores for hours of racial bias training. Race had been an issue even before, when Schultz asked employees to talk to customers about racial justice.\n\nHoward Schultz: We had a moral obligation as a company to discuss this.\n\nScott Pelley: And, then, you were excoriated for having a coffee shop tell people what it thinks about humanity.\n\nHoward Schultz: The execution was flawed. And who owns that execution? I do because I was the one who was pushing us to not play it safe.\n\nBut from the beginning his 350,000 employees caught a break with Schultz's social agenda.\n\nThey enjoy health insurance, tuition aid and stock.\n\nSchultz likes to say he created the company his impoverished parents never had the chance to work for.\n\nHoward Schultz: When I read statistics that says that over 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank and only a crisis away from bankruptcy, or that five and a half million kids in America, many of whom are African American and Latino, are not in school and not in work and don't have a chance, and one out of six people in America are food insecure, this is what I think about.\n\nThose grim numbers describe his own childhood.\n\nHoward Schultz: This place has never left me. I think it has defined my character, my vulnerability\n\nSchultz took us back in time to his boyhood home,\n\nScott Pelley: And this is the way up to the seventh floor.\n\nA Brooklyn, New York, public housing project. His family was already poor when his father was injured on the job. With no insurance, they were destitute. And bitterness led to violence.\n\nScott Pelley: Your father beat you-- with his fists.\n\nHoward Schultz: There were moments where there was physical abuse, yes.\n\nScott Pelley: He beat you up, when you were taking a shower. And you ended up crumpled on the floor of the shower, watching your blood go down the drain. At that moment, you thought what?\n\nHoward Schultz: I was 15. I was disrespectful to my mother. He came home and-- beat me to a pulp. I couldn't go to school for a couple days. I was angry, upset.\n\nScott Pelley: Did you hate him?\n\nHoward Schultz: I'm sure there were moments when I did. And then there were glorious moments of being in the right-field bleachers at Yankee Stadium with him. There is a level of hate that does emerge. But it didn't stay.\n\nHis journey is mapped in a new autobiography titled \"From the Ground Up.\"\n\nScott Pelley: If your father was the darkness, your mother was the light.\n\nHoward Schultz: She was. And my self-esteem came from my mother. And I could say that if-- if my mother was here, if my mother-- for her, it would just be the greatest moment of her life, to think. Because one of the things that is, has been so hard for me is that both my parents didn't-- did not see my success at Starbucks. maybe I'm here because of her.\n\nScott Pelley: Well, let me see if I can find out where you are on some of the issues that are pressing in the country. Immigration.\n\nHoward Schultz: The country first and foremost is based on humanity, fairness, goodness, we have been for 200-plus years a country of immigrants. And for the 11 million people here unauthorized, there should be a fair and equitable way for them to get in line, pay the taxes, pay a fee, and become citizens of the United States.\n\nScott Pelley: Climate change.\n\nHoward Schultz: Tremendous mistake, again, by President Trump, to leave the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nScott Pelley: Health care.\n\nScott Pelley: Every American deserves the right to have access to quality health care. But what the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall. And that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford.\n\nScott Pelley: The 2018 tax cut.\n\nHoward Schultz: I would not have given a free ride to business, from 35 percent or 37 percent to 21 percent. It would've been more modest. But I would've significantly addressed the people who need tax relief the most, which is the people I talked about earlier, who don't have $400 in the bank.\n\nScott Pelley: Many people are going to ask what does the coffee entrepreneur know about being commander in chief?\n\nHoward Schultz: I have a long history of recognizing, I'm not the smartest person in the room, that in order to make great decisions about complex problems, I have to recruit and attract people who are smarter than me and more experienced, more skilled, and we've got to create an understanding that we need a creative debate in the room to make these kind of decisions.\n\nHis world view is shaped by his experience as a global CEO.\n\nHoward Schultz: Is it in our national interest to have a fight with Mexico, Canada, the EU, China, NATO? Is it in our interest? Give me a break. No, it's not in our interest. These are our friends. These are our allies. We are much better, as a country, being part of the world order.\n\nSheri and Howard Schultz\n\nSchultz formed his alliance with his wife Sheri when they were married more than 36 years ago. Today, they have a son and a daughter, two grandchildren and another on the way. Sheri schultz oversees the family's $200 million charity that links disadvantaged youth and veterans to jobs.\n\nScott Pelley: This is a long, rocky road, running for president. Is this something you wanna do?\n\nSheri Schultz: Well, it, it wasn't in my plan, my long-term life plan for sure.\n\nScott Pelley: Did he tell you or did he ask you?\n\nSheri Schultz: No, he asked. He came to the family. We knew it was serious--\n\nHoward Schultz: I'm still-- I'm still asking.\n\nSheri Schultz: He's still asking and many family meetings.\n\nHe's still asking himself whether to run. But he has assembled a campaign team and he's done the homework.\n\nScott Pelley: Can you get on the ballot in all 50 states?\n\nHoward Schultz: If I decide to run for president, not only will I be on the ballot of every state, all 50 states, but we'll be on the ballot in every county, in every district, that we have done that work.\n\nScott Pelley: Would the stores be part of this? Is there going to be a Schultz 2020 button on every green apron across the country?\n\nHoward Schultz: Uh, no there would be a complete separation between me and the company.\n\nScott Pelley: What we know is that no independent has ever come close to winning.\n\nHoward Schultz: What we know, factually, is that over 40 percent of the electorate is either a registered Independent or currently affiliates themselves as an Independent. Because the American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice.\n\nScott Pelley: What effect do you think being Jewish would have on your campaign?\n\nHoward Schultz: I have great faith in the goodness and kindness of the American people. We elected an African-American president. I'm old enough to remember in 1960 when John F. Kennedy was running and there was an outcry of hate that no one Catholic should be president. I am Jewish, I have faith in God. I am not running as a Jew if I decide to run for president I'm running as an American who happens to be Jewish.\n\nScott Pelley: Your net worth is something close to $3.5 billion and Forbes magazine would tell you that that's more money than Donald Trump has. Are you willing to spend what it takes to win?\n\nHoward Schultz: Well, I'll say it this way we'll be fully resourced to do what's necessary.\n\nScott Pelley: Winning could cost $300 million, $500 million. Do those numbers change your mind?\n\nHoward Schultz: No.\n\nScott Pelley: Would you release your tax returns?\n\nHoward Schultz: 100 percent. Yes.\n\nScott Pelley: Well, Donald Trump said that.\n\nHoward Schultz: I will. We can do it today, if you want Scott.\n\nDecades ago, housewares salesman Howard Schultz fell for the traditions of Seattle's Pike Place Market. Some traditions slimier than others. Now he's challenging tradition, asking whether Americans want to toss old politics into fresh hands.\n\nScott Pelley: You know it's 'on' after this interview. President Trump is gonna be tweeting by about 8:00 Eastern Time.\n\nHoward Schultz: You know, I'm \u2013\n\nScott Pelley: Gonna say terrible things about you.\n\nHoward Schultz: I think, like most people, I'm, I've become bored with President Trump and his tweets.\n\nProduced by Ashley Velie.

These giant billion-dollar satellites take high resolution photographs which can see objects as small as a fist inside Russia, North Korea or wherever the target is. Tonight we will take you inside the intelligence agency where those photos are analyzed, and we will also take you inside a revolution that is rocking the top secret world of spy satellites. A private company named Planet Labs has put about 300 small satellites into space, enough to take a picture of the entire land mass of the Earth every day. Those small satellites have created a big data problem for the government which can't possibly hire enough analysts to look at all those pictures. Welcome to the revolution.\n\nThis is how the revolution began. Twenty-eight small satellites sent out into orbit by astronauts from the biggest of all satellites, the International Space Station.\n\n\"Dove\" satellites are deployed\n\nRobbie Schingler: We took a satellite that would be the size of a pick-up truck and we shrunk it.

They're about 12 pounds or five kilograms.\n\nCorrespondent David Martin with Robbie Schingler\n\nPacked with some of the same electronics used in smartphones, they're built by hand in a nondescript building in downtown San Francisco.\n\nRobbie Schingler: It looks like a warehouse and our engineers here build and operate the largest fleet of satellites in human history.\n\nDavid Martin: That's a pretty big statement: \"largest fleet of satellites in human history.\"\n\nRobbie Schingler: I know. Isn't that cool? And frankly we're just getting started.\n\nDavid Martin: How many have you built over the years?\n\nRobbie Schingler: Oh, over the years, we've built about 300 satellites. Over the years. And last year we launched about 146 satellites into space.\n\nThe satellites are called doves. Here on the production floor they are kept in \"nests,\" waiting to be launched in \"flocks.\"\n\nRobbie Schingler: This is a visualization that shows every satellite that we have up in space today.\n\nDavid Martin: This is mission control?\n\nRobbie Schingler: This is mission control, yeah.\n\nDavid Martin: It's a little bit of a letdown.\n\nRobbie Schingler: It's a little bit non-traditional. A-- a normal mission control you will have dozens and dozens of engineers for one satellite. We flip that around, so we have dozens of satellites for a single engineer.\n\nCan commercial satellites be used for espionage?\n\nThe satellites orbit the globe every 90 minutes while the Earth rotates beneath them, their cameras documenting the planet as it's changing.\n\nWill Marshall: I'm always astonished that almost every picture we get down, we compare it to the picture from yesterday, and something's changed.\n\nWill Marshall is another of the company's founders.\n\nWill Marshall: We see rivers move, we see trees go down, we see vehicles move, we see road surfaces change and it gives you a perspective of the planet as a dynamic and evolving thing that we need to take care of.\n\nDavid Martin: Is that what people are supposed to conclude from seeing all this change?\n\nWill Marshall: Well, you can't fix what you can't see.\n\nThat kind of save-the-world ambition carries a big risk, especially for a small firm that's just getting started.\n\nWill Marshall: Planet has many records. We've launched the most satellites in the world ever, but we've also lost the most satellites ever.\n\nFour years ago, Marshall gathered his staff in what planet calls the \"mothership\" to watch a rocket carrying 26 doves blast off.\n\nWill Marshall: It was a big deal. And we had a customer in the audience at the time that we had brought to see a launch. It was really embarrassing.\n\nWill Marshall\n\nChester Gillmore: I'll never forget it we see the, you know, smoke coming and everyone's cheering and then it goes, and then ka-boom.\n\nChester Gillmore runs Planet's satellite assembly line.\n\nDavid Martin: You lost how many satellites?\n\nChester Gillmore: Twenty-six, I think we lost, yeah, 26 (makes explosion sound).\n\nDavid Martin: Those are your babies.\n\nChester Gillmore: They were. That was a tough, yeah, they were.\n\nDavid Martin: How long did it take to get back to normal?\n\nChester Gillmore: We didn't even skip a beat when that happened, didn't lose a day.\n\nOn the day we visited Planet its satellites were beaming down 1.2 million pictures every 24 hours.\n\nPlanet sells images to over 200 customers, many of them agricultural companies monitoring the health of crops. But this is Planet's most important customer.\n\nRobert Cardillo shows correspondent David Martin around the NGA operations center\n\nRobert Cardillo: So, this is our operations center. Heartbeat of the agency.\n\nRobert Cardillo is director of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, NGA for short, the organization which analyzes satellite photos.\n\nDavid Martin: So this really is ground zero for all the intelligence coming in from space?\n\nRobert Cardillo: That's correct. It's-- it's where we bring in all of our sources, whether they come from space or any source. But, correct, it's ground zero.\n\nBecause 60 Minutes was allowed into this secure operations center, top-secret high-resolution pictures taken by spy satellites are nowhere in sight.\n\nRobert Cardillo: Across the center. You see one of the outposts that the Chinese have developed in the South China Sea.\n\nCardillo says lower resolution images like this one are taken by commercial satellite companies are changing his world by giving him more and more looks at the Earth, especially places U.S. spy satellites are not zeroed in on.\n\nRobert Cardillo: I'm quite excited about capabilities such as what Planet's putting up in space.\n\nPlanet is a small company with just over 400 employees, many of them in San Francisco. NGA is a government bureaucracy with a workforce of 14,500 and a 2.7 million square-foot headquarters south of Washington, D.C. But Robert Cardillo knew a revolution when he saw one.\n\nWill Marshall: This is not a scale model. This is the real size.\n\nWhen Planet's Will Marshall unveiled his small satellite at a 2014 Ted Talk, Cardillo showed the video to his work force.\n\nWill Marshall: It's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet.\n\nAnd a radical new culture. Planet openly markets its images. NGA's spy photos rarely see the light of day. The intelligence analyst who leaked these photos of a Russan shipyard in 1984 went to prison. What NGA can see from space is top secret.\n\nDavid Martin: How many of these high resolution satellites do you operate?\n\nRobert Cardillo: I'll not comment.\n\nRobert Cardillo\n\nBut much of what Cardillo won't talk about is common knowledge to Ted Molczan, who is a household name in the obscure world of amateur satellite tracking.\n\nDavid Martin: How many photo satellites does the U.S. have in orbit?\n\nTed Molczan: Currently there are three.\n\nSince we interviewed Molczan, what looks like a fourth photo satellite has been launched. He tracks them from his balcony in downtown Toronto with nothing more sophisticated than $300 binoculars.\n\nDavid Martin: You just wait for a fly-by...\n\nTed Molczan: Yeah.\n\nDavid Martin: ...from a satellite.\n\nTed Molczan: Yeah. I'm laying in wait.\n\nDavid Martin: For something that's 150 miles away going five miles a second.\n\nTed Molczan: Yes. And it will cross my field of view in a few seconds. So I've gotta be on the ball.\n\nHere's what a top secret satellite looks like from Earth, captured on video by one of about 20 amateur trackers around the world.\n\nTed Molczan: Its code name is Crystal. This thing is about the size of a city bus.\n\nDavid Martin: And this is what it looks like from Earth?\n\nTed Molczan: That's right. It just looks like a moving star.\n\nThe satellite trackers watch as it streaks across the sky, measuring its position against well-known stars.\n\nDavid Martin: That's enough to tell the orbit of the satellite?\n\nTed Molczan: Yes. We're doing this with our eyes, often with cameras, but the end result of it is numbers. And if we pool enough of that data together, we can actually calculate the orbit to great precision.\n\nDavid Martin: If you've been able to calculate this, presumably the North Koreans have been able to calculate this.\n\nTed Molczan: Absolutely, yes.\n\nDavid Martin: So there's no mystery to the North Koreans, the Russians, the Iranians, the Chinese when these satellites are overhead taking pictures?\n\nTed Molczan: That's right.\n\nTed Molczan with his binoculars\n\nIt's space-age hide and seek. Adversaries know when and where American spy satellites are looking but can never be sure what they're finding.\n\nRobert Cardillo: This is what NGA developed in the pursuit of Osama bin Laden.\n\nBefore President Obama and his national security team, including Cardillo there on the left, gathered in the White House Situation Room on the night of the raid, NGA had gone back in time through seven years of satellite imagery to construct this scale model of Bin Laden's hideout.\n\nRobert Cardillo: We had historic imagery of this compound that enabled us to reverse time.\n\nNGA could see not just the outside, but inside as well.\n\nRobert Cardillo: It enabled us to go back to the point of construction. And essentially through our imagery archive to rebuild the house so, we could see how the first floor was designed and how the rooms would lay out, where are the stairs from the first to the second floor and the second to the third floor.\n\nDavid Martin: So old pictures show that building before the roof went on?\n\nRobert Cardillo: We had pictures before the compound existed. We saw it when it was first constructed and as it, as it was built over time. Correct.\n\nDavid Martin: And that's how you could find out the dimensions of each room?\n\nRobert Cardillo: Indeed.\n\nThe satellites that made that possible are the equivalent of a Hubble Space Telescope. But instead of taking pictures of the heavens they are zeroed in on Earth, able to make out objects just four inches across.\n\nFor decades they have been indispensable to knowing what America's adversaries are up to, but like Hubble they cost billions of dollars each. Which is one reason there are so few in orbit.\n\nDavid Martin: Are they putting more up?\n\nTed Molczan: They've never had more than four up at a time.\n\nWhich is why Cardillo is so interested in Planet and its small satellites that deliver a tsunami of data like NGA has never seen.\n\nDavid Martin: How many analysts would it take to keep up with those number of satellites?\n\nRobert Cardillo: We did some calculations and we came up with six million humans would need to be hired to exploit all the imagery that we have access to. You can see that it's not exactly a viable proposition.\n\nShawna Wolverton: If you were trying to find this in Syria, it's sort of, like, a needle in a haystack, right?\n\nPlanet's Shawna Wolverton showed us how a computer can be programmed to help track the impact of Syria's Civil War on the people who live there.\n\nShawna Wolverton: So, what we've done is created a algorithm that looks for new roads and buildings.\n\nAn algorithm that rifled through reams of satellite photos and identified the first signs of a new refugee camp.\n\nShawna Wolverton: Here's that first image.\n\nDavid Martin: So, that red grid is what?\n\nShawna Wolverton: Those are new roads. And all of these blue spots that you can see here are buildings.\n\nDavid Martin: So, this is one little corner of, of Syria. Could you do this for the entire country?\n\nShawna Wolverton: We can absolutely do this for the entire country. I can show you over here. We can zoom out. And you can see that we've run this algorithm over the entire country and you can see all of the roads and buildings.\n\nThis is the first photo an American spy satellite ever took from space, in 1960. A far off look at a Russian airfield. Since then we have gotten much more spectacular looks at Earth, like these taken by the Apollo astronauts. But the U.S. government no longer holds a monopoly on photos from space and has no power to stamp top-secret on any of the 800 million images Planet has taken in its brief lifetime.\n\nDavid Martin: Making it available to everybody, people are going to come up with uses of that imagery that you haven't...\n\nWill Marshall: Yeah.\n\nDavid Martin: ...imagined.\n\nWill Marshall: Dreamed of, yeah.\n\nDavid Martin: And not all of them are going to be good.\n\nWill Marshall: No.\n\nDavid Martin: You worry about that?\n\nWill Marshall: I worry a lot and we wouldn't have started Planet if we didn't have a very strong conviction that the vast majority of the use cases are very, very positive.\n\nProduced by Mary Walsh and Tadd J.

Over 25 states took in more from their lottery proceeds than from corporate income tax. Because of these stakes, it's essential that, in both perception and reality, lotteries are truly games of chance, everyone entering with an equal opportunity to win. Which is why investigators took note when a retired couple from Michigan, Jerry and Marge Selbee, made $26 million winning various state lottery games dozens of times. This is not a story, though, of a con, or a scam, or an inside job. No, this is a ballad of a couple from small-town America who did something that most people only dream of. They didn't so much as beat the lottery odds as they figured them out.\n\nFor years, high school sweethearts Jerry and Marge Selbee lived a quiet life in Evart, Michigan, population 1900. A single-stoplight factory-town that collapses in the folds of a map.\n\nTogether they raised six kids and ran a local convenience store on Main Street. Jerry handled the liquor and cigarettes and Marge kept the books and made the sandwiches.\n\nMarge and Jerry Selbee\n\nJon Wertheim: How long did you have the store?\n\nJerry Selbee: 17 years.\n\nJon Wertheim: 17 years?\n\nJerry Selbee: Uh-huh.\n\nJon Wertheim: Every day?\n\nJerry Selbee: Uh-huh.\n\nMarge Selbee: Every day.\n\nJon Wertheim: Why'd you decide to sell it?\n\nJerry Selbee: I was 62. Marge was 63. And I thought it was a nice time to sell and see what we could do after that.\n\nJon Wertheim: You're in your early 60s, you decide to retire.\n\nBoth: Uh-huh.\n\nJon Wertheim: You're gonna put your feet up. What was the plan?\n\nJerry Selbee: Yeah (chuckle) that was basically it.\n\nMarge Selbee: I don't think we had one per se.\n\nJerry Selbee: That was basically it. We were gonna enjoy life a little bit.\n\nJerry and Marge bet big. Now Hollywood is calling\n\nBut one morning in 2003, Jerry happened to walk back into the corner store and spotted a brochure for a brand new lottery game called Winfall. Jerry always possessed what he calls, \"a head for math.\" He has a bachelor's degree in the subject from nearby Western Michigan University. And in only a matter of minutes, he realized that this was a unique game.\n\nJerry Selbee: I read it and by the time I was out here I knew what the potential might be.\n\nJon Wertheim: It did not take you weeks to suss this out?\n\nJerry Selbee: No, no, not at all. Three minutes.\n\nJon Wertheim: Three minutes and you found the loophole in the state lottery?\n\nJerry Selbee: Three minutes. I found-- I found a special feature. (laughs)\n\nThat feature was called a \"Rolldown\", and the lottery announced when it was coming. Unlike the Mega Millions games you've probably heard of where the jackpot keeps building until someone hits all six numbers and wins the big prize, in Winfall, if the jackpot reached $5 million, and no one matched all six numbers, all the money 'rolled down' to the lower-tier prize winners, dramatically boosting the payouts of those who matched five, four or three numbers.\n\nSound complicated? Well, it wasn't to Jerry. See if you can stick with him here.\n\nJerry Selbee: Here's what I said. I said if I played $1,100 mathematically I'd have one 4-number winner, that's 1,000 bucks. I divided 1,100 by six instead of 57 because I did a mental quick dirty and I come up with 18. So I knew I'd have either 18 or 19 3-number winners and that's 50 bucks each. At 18 I got $1,000 for a 4-number winner, and I got 18 3-number winners worth $50 each, so that's 900 bucks. So I got $1,100 invested and I've got a $1,900 return.\n\nJon Wertheim: Sounds like good math\n\nJerry Selbee: That's-- yeah (laugh) a little over 80 percent isn't it?\n\nJon Wertheim: You're talking about this as if it's the most obvious set of figures in the world\n\nJerry Selbee: it is. (Chuckle)\n\nJon Wertheim: This is not taxing the outer limits of your math skills.\n\nJerry Selbee: No, it is actually it's just basic arithmetic.\n\nJon Wertheim: Are you thinking, \"I bet there are a million people that have also caught onto this?\"\n\nJerry Selbee: Exactly, is what I thought.\n\nWhen a rolldown was announced, Jerry sprang into action. He bought $3,600 in Winfall tickets and won $6,300. Then he bet $8,000 and nearly doubled it.\n\nThe Selbees with correspondent Jon Wertheim\n\nJerry Selbee: At that point, I told Marge what I was doing. (Laugh)\n\nJon Wertheim: I was gonna say, you're putting thousands of dollars in action on the state lottery game, at what point do you share this with your wife?\n\nJerry Selbee: Right at that point\n\nJon Wertheim: Jerry says, \"I think I've cracked the Michigan State Lottery.\" What do you say to that?\n\nMarge Selbee: He just, you know (chuckle) it didn't surprise me.\n\nJon Wertheim: You weren't surprised?\n\nMarge Selbee: No, I wasn't surprised. Because as long as nobody wins and you win money, you could see the numbers.\n\nJon Wertheim: So when you realized there aren't a million people that have discovered this, it's pretty much just you, what's that feeling like?\n\nJerry Selbee: Amazed. (Laugh)\n\nMarge Selbee: Yeah.\n\nJerry Selbee: Amazed.\n\nMarge Selbee: Pretty happy.\n\nJerry Selbee: I just couldn't, I just couldn't fathom it.\n\nSoon Jerry and Marge Selbee started playing for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Jerry set up a corporation, G.S. Investment Strategies. He showed us stacks of record books that detailed their winnings.\n\nJerry Selbee: Here's one that was pretty successful. We played $515,000 and we got back $853,000\n\nJon Wertheim: It's about a 60 percent return?\n\nJerry Selbee: That was a good return. (Laugh)\n\nThey invited family and friends to share in their, well, windfall, selling shares in the corporation for $500 apiece. You might say this was a different kind of hedge fund. We met some of the local investors at the evart hangout spot, Sugar Rae's Caf\u00e9.\n\nJon Wertheim: All four of you guys are members of an exclusive club.\n\nAll: Yeah. (laugh)\n\nJames White is a local attorney, Dave Huff operated a machine and tool shop and brothers Loren and Ray Gerber are retired farmers.\n\nJames White: And when you looked at the mathematics of it, it made sense.\n\nJon Wertheim: You guys followed the math when he broke it down?\n\nDave Huff: Pretty much.\n\nLoren Gerber: Yeah, yeah, but he's really good at math\n\nJon Wertheim: So he explained this?\n\nLoren Gerber: You ask him questions\u2026\n\nJames White: Yeah, he's a math whiz\n\nJon Wertheim: Do you guys remember how much you gave him to invest?\n\nLoren Gerber: I had about $8,000 and then I put another six in for the grandkids.\n\nJon Wertheim: For the grandkids?\n\nLoren Gerber: Yeah\n\nJon Wertheim: But overall you guys came out way ahead on this?\n\nAll: Oh yeah, oh yeah,\n\nLoren Gerber: It was a good game.\n\nDave Huff: It helped me put three kids through school and one through law school. So it was quite beneficial to me.\n\nJon Wertheim: Used it for education?\n\nDave Huff: Pretty much.\n\nJames White: There's a lot of people around town that knew what it was about and talk about it and that it occurred.\n\nDave Huff: But a lot of people were really leery.\n\nLoren Gerber: You bet!\n\nDave Huff: They were thinking, \"You guys are nuts.\"\n\nShareholders of the Selbees' company\n\nBy the spring of 2005, Jerry's club stood at 25 members. Those willing to press their luck included three state troopers, a factory plant manager, and a bank vice president. They had played Winfall 12 times, winning millions. When Michigan suddenly shut down the game, citing, ironically, lack of sales.\n\nJon Wertheim: Michigan game gets closed down. How long before you realize there was a game in Massachusetts that also presented some favorable odds?\n\nJerry Selbee: One of our players emailed me and he said \"Massachusetts has a game called Cash Winfall. Do you think we could play that?\"\n\nJon Wertheim: I've heard that..\n\nJerry Selbee: And so I got on the computer. I looked at the game and once I researched it, I got back with him and I said, we can play that game.\n\nJon Wertheim: We got another winner. How long did it take you this time to figure out that you could get a positive return here?\n\nJerry Selbee: Ten minutes.\n\nThat's when Jerry and Marge Selbee developed a routine they continued for the next six years, driving 900 miles to Massachusetts every time there was a rolldown and buying hundreds of thousands of tickets at two local convenience stores. Then they holed up, not in some fancy suite at the high rollers hotel, but in a room at the Red Roof Inn, sorting the tickets by hand for 10 hours a day, 10 days straight, not so much playing the lottery, as working it.\n\nJon Wertheim: So once there was a rolldown, on average, how much were you putting in play?\n\nJerry Selbee: Over $600,000 per play. Seven plays a year.\n\nJon Wertheim: $4.2 million once this rolldown was coming?\n\nJerry Selbee: Per year.\n\nJon Wertheim: Did you ever get nervous?\n\nMarge Selbee: Oh yeah. (laugh)\n\nJon Wertheim: What'd you do with all the losing tickets?\n\nJerry Selbee: Saved them.\n\nJon Wertheim: You saved all the losing tickets?\n\nMarge Selbee: Saved them in big totes.\n\nJerry Selbee: Big plastic totes.\n\nJon Wertheim: There must have been millions.\n\nJerry Selbee: 18.\n\nJon Wertheim: $18 million worth of losing tickets. And you have those?\n\nJerry Selbee: Uh-huh just in case we had a physical federal audit.\n\nMarge Selbee: We had the upstairs of the barn. I stored them in one end and in the other end. And then I thought, \"Oh no, this floor is gonna fall through.\" So then we stored them down in the pole barn. And we had probably 60, 65 tubs of tickets.\n\nJon Wertheim: Did you guys ever say, \"We're supposed to be retired here. We're making 14-hour drives to Massachusetts.\"\n\nJerry Selbee: We're having fun.\n\nJon Wertheim: It's fun for you guys?\n\nMarge Selbee: It's fun.\n\nJerry Selbee: It's fun doing it.\n\nMarge Selbee: You get a high on it\n\nJerry Selbee: And it gave you the satisfaction of being successful at something that was worthwhile to not only us personally but to our friends and our family.\n\nScott Allen of the Boston Globe\n\nBut in 2011, the Boston Globe got a tip and discovered that in certain Massachussetts locations, Cash Winfall tickets were being sold at an extraordinary volume.\n\nScott Allen: Smart people had figured out if I buy enough of these tickets, I'll always be a winner. I'll get back more than I spent.\n\nScott allen oversees the Globe's investigative reporters, known as the Spotlight team. The paper's reporting revealed that two groups were dominating Cash Winfall: the Selbee gang from Evart, Michigan, and their competition, a syndicate led by math majors from MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These were kids young enough to be the Selbees' grandchildren.\n\nScott Allen: The guy who started it, he was doing an independent study project as an undergraduate at MIT and he figured out that he could win this game. So he got a bunch of his friends to pool in their money so they became, as time went on, professional Cash Winfall players, recruiting their friends and raising money from backers until they too were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nIncredibly, the MIT group bet between $17 and $18 million on Cash Winfall over a seven-year period, earning at least $3.5 million in profits. Almost the exact same rate of return as the Selbees.\n\nJon Wertheim: You've got a syndicate from Northwest Michigan, you've got a group of MIT students. Did your story meter start beeping?\n\nScott Allen: It was-- oh it's a great story.\n\nThe Boston Globe articles caused a sensation, raising suspicion that the game was rigged.\n\nThe Massachusetts state treasurer shut down the Cash Winfall game and called for an investigation. It was led by then-state inspector general, Greg Sullivan.\n\nGreg Sullivan: When we got involved, the public perception was there must be some kind of organized crime or public corruption to explain how millions of dollars are being bet by syndicates on state lottery tickets. We really looked at this, looking for corruption. We used subpoenas, we looked at documents, we interviewed dozens of people to look at this in detail with a hypothesis that something illegal had happened.\n\nGreg Sullivan, the Massachusetts state inspector general who investigated the Cash Winfall game\n\nJon Wertheim: You went into this looking for organized crime. As the story unfolded, were you surprised by what you found?\n\nGreg Sullivan: I wasn't surprised. I was dumbfoundely amazed that these math-nerd geniuses had found a way legally to win a state lottery and make millions from it\n\nJon Wertheim: And the state's getting rich in the process.\n\nGreg Sullivan: And the state got very rich. The state made $120 million.\n\nThe investigation found no one's odds of winning was affected by high-volume betting. When the jackpot hit the rolldown threshold, Cash Winfall became a good bet for everyone, not just the big time bettors like the Selbees. By then though, Massachusetts State Lottery had moved on to a different game without a statistical twist.\n\nAnd with that, Jerry and Marge Selbee's excellent adventure drew to an end.\n\nIn total, their unlikely homegrown company grossed more than $26 million from nine years of playing the lottery.\n\nJon Wertheim: Your corporation, $26 million. You smile when you recounted that figure.\n\nJerry Selbee: Uh-huh. That was satisfactory.\n\nJon Wertheim: Satisfactory?\n\nJerry Selbee: Yeah.\n\nThey made nearly $8 million in profit before taxes. Back in Evart, not exactly the land of extravagance, the Selbees put their winnings to practical use, renovating their home and helping their six kids, 14 grandkids and 10 great-grandchildren pay for their education. They still get together with members of their lottery group. But millions of dollars in Winfall tickets have been replaced by nickel and dime poker night, and Marge makes everyone chicken pot pie.\n\nJon Wertheim: I'm struck by how measured you are, telling this story. Do you find anything remarkable about this?\n\nJerry Selbee: The only thing I found really remarkable is nobody else really seemed to grasp it.\n\nJon Wertheim: What I'm hearing you say is that this part of the country is really good at keeping a secret\n\nJerry Selbee: (Laugh)\n\nProduced by Katherine Davis and Jennifer Marz"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elijah-cummings-new-power-as-house-oversight-committee-chairman-for-investigating-trump-60-minutes/", "text": "Editor's Note: In this story, as originally broadcast, footage of the 2015 Freddie Gray street protests in Philadelphia was mistakenly used. It has been replaced with footage of the Freddie Gray protests in Baltimore.\n\nOn Thursday, we learned President Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who is headed for prison, will testify in a televised hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. It marked the beginning of season three of what's been called the \"Donald Trump Reality Show\" with a fresh plot, and new characters ushered in by voters in the midterm election who gave Democrats control of the House of Representatives. Among the recently empowered is Congressman Elijah Cummings, the new chairman of the House oversight committee. It has the constitutional authority to investigate anything it wants, creating serious problems for the Trump administration and making Cummings one of the most powerful people in Washington.\n\nElijah Cummings has been a familiar face on Capitol Hill for a long time, a respected 13-term Maryland congressman who has served on the oversight and reform committee under four different presidents. And he was handpicked by the Democratic leaders for this job.\n\nCongressman Elijah Cummings\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: We are in a fight for the soul of our democracy. And you've got to understand that. This is serious business.\n\nYou can dismiss the congressman's statement as partisan hyperbole, but part of the government is shuttered, four of President Trump's former associates are now convicted felons, ten of his original cabinet secretaries have left, four under a cloud of scandal. And there are 17 other investigations underway. Not counting the ones that are about to begin in the new Democratic House of Representatives empowered with the legal authority to compel testimony and demand documents.\n\nSteve Kroft: So how are you gonna run this committee?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to work with the Republicans as I have in the past. You know why? Because that's our job. And when it comes to subpoena, I know the power of a subpoena, having practiced laws. In order to do oversight, you gotta have documents. You gotta have emails. You gotta have information.\n\nFor the first two years of the Trump administration that kind of information was beyond the reach of house Democrats. The power of subpoena belonged exclusively to the Republican majority. As ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, Cummings made 64 requests for subpoenas on things like White House security clearances, hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, and the Justice Department's refusal to defend the Affordable Care Act. All of them were blocked by the Republican chairman.\n\nSteve Kroft: You've asked the White House for a bunch of things. you've asked for documents connected to Jared Kushner's use of private emails. Child separation policy at the border. Have you ever gotten anything?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Zero.\n\nSteve Kroft: Nothing?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Zero. --that's the point. Now, I-- I don't know if any president has ever done this. None. None that has ever said, \"I'm not givin' you anything.\" For anything. Nothing.\n\nSteve Kroft: But you're sitting here telling me you think somehow, miraculously, he's going to change.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: it's not about miraculous. It's about-- adherence to the Constitution. And the American people and the Congress is insisting that he allows us to do our job. Basically what the president has done and the Republicans have done, they've joined hands. And the Republicans have been basically not only blocking but become the defense counsel for the president. Okay. But no documents? I mean, come on.\n\nCummings with his wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\n\nNow as chairman of the oversight committee, Cummings no longer has to consult with the Republicans to issue subpoenas, initiate investigations or call hearings, and he has a much bigger budget and staff. So will Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, and Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, but their inquiries will be limited to their specific jurisdictions. Cummings' committee has the authority to investigate anything inside or outside the federal government.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: We can look at anything.\n\nSteve Kroft: You could--\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Anything.\n\nSteve Kroft: --look at Interior, you could look at E.P.A.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Anything. but the fact that we can look at anything is part of the problem. There's so much. No, I'm-- I'm serious. There's so much.\n\nSteve Kroft: And you only have two years.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Less than that. Actually, less than that. The Congress doesn't meet but so many days in a year. And all I'm saying is that we've gotta hit the ground, not running, but flying.\n\nRep. Cummings' father: \"You will fly one day\"\n\nSome Democrats believe Cummings should go for the jugular and push for impeachment. He says it's premature, and he also wants to pursue other issues especially the high cost of prescription drugs. His staff has already sent out 51 letters to government officials, the White House, and the Trump Organization asking for documents related to investigations that the committee may launch. The issues range from the private use of government owned aircraft by cabinet members to the flow of foreign money into various Trump enterprises like his hotel in Washington.\n\nSteve Kroft: You think he's making money off this job?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Please.\n\nSteve Kroft: A lotta money?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: A lotta money.\n\nSteve Kroft: And-- and you say the Constitution and the laws say it's not okay?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: It's not okay. And, but this is the other piece. I still believe that people-- the average citizen, the guys on my block, they oughta know if the president is making a deal, whether he's making it-- making it in his self-interest or that of the country.\n\nIn response, the White House said: \"these claims are completely baseless, but we cannot comment further about ongoing litigation.\"\n\nElijah Cummings has been in Congress for 23 years but he is not a creature of Washington. When he needs to be there he commutes from his Maryland district, an hour's drive to the north, where he represents 700,000 people and most of the city of Baltimore. He was born here 67 years ago to parents with fourth grade educations who'd been sharecroppers in South Carolina before moving north for a better life. His father worked in a chemical plant, his mother was a domestic. Both were pentecostal ministers.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: First it was religion, and then it was the education. My father, Steve, had a saying. He said-- he told us, \"If you miss one day of school, that meant you died the night before.\" And he meant that. I did not miss one second of school between kindergarten and graduating from high school. Not one second.\n\nHe graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Howard University before earning a law degree at Maryland. He says he is one of the few congressmen who live in an inner-city, working-class neighborhood.\n\nCorrespondent Steve Kroft with Cummings at the congressman's home in Baltimore\n\nSteve Kroft: How long have you lived here?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: 37 years.\n\nHe says he keeps a campaign poster in the front window so people will know where to find him.\n\nSteve Kroft: So you like to be among your constituents?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: I like to be among my constituents. Let me tell you something man, if I don't do well in this block I'm in trouble. I mean, if you wanna take a poll, if I lost in this block I might as well go-- I might as well stay home.\n\nWhen riots broke out in Baltimore three years ago after the death of a young black man, Freddie Gray, who was fatally injured in the back of a police van, Cummings gained national attention walking the troubled neighborhoods trying to keep the peace. He is part of the city's fabric.\n\nRep. Cummings' prayer: \"Guard my mouth\"\n\nBut now he has stepped onto a much larger stage, under the bright lights of the oversight committee.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Well, I sit here. And the Democrats'll be all over here. And the Republicans will be over there. Our hearings can go anywhere from an hour and a half to 11 or 12 hours.\n\nSteve Kroft: So you got a good, comfortable chair.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Got a good, comfortable chair. And I gotta tell you, Steve-- standing here, it just-- it sorta gives me chills in a way because I think about my journey to this chair.\n\nAfter years as the committee's ranking minority member, he is ready to wield the gavel and the subpoena.\n\nSteve Kroft: You've got a lotta power. But you don't have unlimited power. I mean--\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: No.\n\nSteve Kroft: --and the Republicans are going to put a lot of obstacles in your way.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Sure. I expect that. Now, there's one big elephant that's sittin' around here that we don't know-- what it's gonna yield. And that is Mueller's report. I don't know what that report is gonna have in it. One thing I do know, though, is whatever it is, even if it-- if it exonerates the president, fine. But this I do know: I want whatever it is, for the Congress to have it, and I want the public to have it, so that everybody can make a judgment.\n\nSteve Kroft: Do you think it's possible the Republicans will try and suppress the report?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: I hope not. But that's a possibility. But I hope not. I hope they don't.\n\nCummings' Republican foil on the committee is Ohio's Jim Jordan, one of the president's most loyal and enthusiastic supporters.\n\nSteve Kroft: You've known Elijah Cummings for a while. How would you describe your relationship?\n\nRep. Jim Jordan: Well, look, there's-- there's not much of anything that-- that Mr. Cummings and I agree on, policy-wise. But-- I certainly respect his toughness-- his tenacity. You know, he's demonstrated that he's-- he's a fighter and I kinda-- my background is such that I kind of appreciate that.\n\nA founding member of the Freedom Caucus, Congressman Jordan is a one-time college wrestler and coach, still known for his scrappiness. He's seldom seen wearing a jacket, and always ready to go to the mat.\n\nCongressman Jim Jordan\n\nRep. Jim Jordan: Taxes have been cut, regulations reduced, the economy growing at an unbelievable rate, lowest unemployment in 50 years. 312,000 jobs added last month alone. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the courts. We're out of the Iran deal. The embassy's in Jerusalem. Hostages are home from North Korea.\n\nAnd oh, by the way, there's a new N.A.F.T.A. agreement. So it's an amazing record and that's what I know about the two years that we've had Donald Trump as President of the United States.\n\nSteve Kroft: After the midterms, you wrote a letter to the Republicans saying, \"You must valiantly defend the president.\" Is that your job?\n\nRep. Jim Jordan: My job is getting to the truth. If the president is getting a raw deal I'm going to defend him.\n\nSteve Kroft: I feel like I would be remiss in this if I didn't point out that truthfulness has not exactly been President Trump's strongest asset.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan: Well, I mean, Steve, look, this-- this president's probably been attacked more than any president that-- in my lifetime. And here's what I know. Over the last two years, in spite of the unprecedented attacks that have come against President Trump, the last two years have been amazing.\n\nRep. Cummings' grandmother: \"Don't you wait\"\n\nChairman Cummings wouldn't disagree that the past two years have been amazing, but in a much different way.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: I don't think the other presidents-- called a lie the truth and the truth a lie. I-- I'm gonna tell you, that's what makes the relationship so difficult. It's hard to trust. You-- you wanna believe that if you make an agreement with someone, and I believed that with the other presidents it was this way, their word was their bond. I don't know how to compare. I-- I-- I don't. And I'm not tryin' to be smart.\n\nSteve Kroft: We're in new territory here.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Yes, it's new territory.\n\nThe new territory now includes a beefed-up White House counsel's office. It has added more than a dozen new lawyers to fight what it anticipates will be a barrage of requests and subpoenas from congress.\n\nSteve Kroft: What happens if you issue a bunch of subpoenas and the administration doesn't respond? Or invokes executive privilege.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: We probably will end up in the courts. And one of the interesting things about the courts is that our president has been making sure that some of the most conservative judges are being p-- appointed-- to the federal bench. And I think he relies on that, and I think that he assumes that the courts will-- will possibly be, it all depends-- be helpful to him.\n\nIt promises to be a demanding time for a man who spent nearly six months in the hospital over the last year and a half for heart and knee surgery. As he showed us the victory prayer chapel, a church founded by his mother, Congressman Cummings relied on a cane and a walker. He says his chairmanship will be a physical burden on him, but his strong faith and awareness of his mortality will see him through.\n\nSteve Kroft: Do you feel like you have the strength--\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Oh yeah, man--\n\nSteve Kroft: --and the stamina to do this?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Like I tell my-- my constituents, \"Don't get it twisted. You know, I may-- my knee may be hurtin' a little bit, but my mind is clear. My mission is clear.\" And I am prepared and able to do what I have to do. And I will do it to the very best of my ability, so help me God.\n\nThis story was produced by Maria Gavrilovic.

Days later, she got the surprise of a lifetime.\n\nHer husband, Skyler, was deployed in Kuwait with the U.S. Army when his twin girls were born on January 24. Their premature babies spent 12 days in the NICU before a nurse arrived with a surprise guest.

Although his legal first name is Robert, he has been known as Beto, the nickname Spanish-speaking communities give names that end in \"berto,\" like Roberto and Alberto, since childhood. He was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the El Paso-based punk group Foss after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1995. O'Rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to El Paso from New York City. After working on several local political campaigns, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. He served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. In 2012, O'Rourke, who speaks fluent Spanish, announced his candidacy for the Democratic primary in the race to represent Texas 16th Congressional District, a Latino-majority district encompassing El Paso and the surrounding communities. He managed to topple eight-term incumbent Silvestre Reyes in the primary and defeated his Republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. While in Congress, the Texas Democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees. On immigration, O'Rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. In 2014, he called President Obama's executive action creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation \"noble\" but \"hard to stomach\" because he believed it bypassed Congress. He also backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's leadership challenge against then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016. O'Rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust Cruz in 2018. His robust Senate bid in Texas -- along with his Obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. Although he failed to unseat Cruz, O'Rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in Texas -- including the state's large and growing Latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. No Democrat had come that close to winning a Senate race in Texas since 1988. Despite the loss, O'Rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. Although he told \"60 Minutes\" shortly before the election that he was \"completely ruling out\" running for president for 2020, O'Rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. Issues In his six years in Congress, O'Rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, LGBT rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights. He often called for improvements to the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. During and after his senate campaign, O'Rourke made immigration a central issue. He has routinely denounced the White House for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued \"zero tolerance\" policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the U.S.-Mexico border. He also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, on a pathway to U.S. citizenship. During a fiery speech in El Paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with President Trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, O'Rourke condemned Mr. Turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. \"We know that walls do not save lives. Walls end lives,\" he said in a border rally that competed with one of Mr. Trump's nearby rallies. \"In the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death.\" Controversy In addition to the scrutiny O'Rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a Senate race, the Texas Democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in Congress and personal life. Although he had a generally liberal voting record in Congress, O'Rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left. In the House, he was a member of the pro-business New Democrat Coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the Democratic Party to support more audacious efforts, like the \"Green New Deal,\" to mitigate climate change. During his Senate campaign, O'Rourke refused to back \"Medicare for all,\" a proposal many 2020 Democrats have vouched their support for. Medicare for All emerges as first litmus test for 2020 Democratic contenders\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduces 2020 policy test with Green New Deal Some candidness may also follow the lead of O'Rourke previous political opponents and raise the issue of his arrest in the 1990s. In 1998, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charges were dismissed after he participated in a DWI program the following year. O'Rourke has apologized for the incident, but he was criticized last year for claiming he did not try to leave the scene after hitting a truck and the Houston Chronicle reporting that witnesses told police he had attempted to leave the scene. What Trump says Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked the speculation around an O'Rourke presidential campaign to challenge him in 2020, pointing to the Texas Democrat's unsuccessful Senate bid. \"I thought you were supposed to win before you run for president,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in December. When the two men held dueling rallies to tout completely different immigration agendas last month, the president bragged his event drew a larger crowd and ridiculed O'Rourke's \"great defeat\" in November.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper Former Gov. John Hickenlooper joins crowded field of 2020 hopefuls Biography Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper grew up outside of Philadelphia, the youngest of four children. He attended Wesleyan University and received a bachelor's in English and a master's degree in Geology. Hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with Buckhorn Petroleum in the 1980s. But the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. There were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so Hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the Wynkoop Brewing Co. The brewery with 15 brewpubs and restaurants, was a success, and it made him a millionaire. In 2003, Hickenlooper ran for Mayor of Denver, in his first ever campaign. Considered a bit of a dark horse candidate who never ran a negative ad, he shocked many and won in a landslide. In 2010, Hickenlooper became the first Denver Mayor elected Governor in 120 years. He was re-elected in 2014, running on another entirely positive campaign Hickenlooper is the second governor or former governor to announce a Democratic presidential bid this cycle, following Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Issues Finishing his second term in the statehouse, Hickenlooper was a popular, pro-business governor. He left Colorado with a strong economy and his tenure was marked by an emphasis on consensus-building. It's that record that he touted in h is campaign video. \"I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington but we also need to get things done,\" Hickenlooper says in the video. \"I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver.\" As governor, Hickenlooper also signed an expansion of Medicaid in 2013. He has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. Hickenlooper has opposed a number of Trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business. Over the summer, he called for an investigation into the separation of thousands of children from their families at the border, and he opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Hickenlooper so far.\n\nJay Inslee Jay Inslee 2020: Washington governor announces presidential bid Biography Born and raised in Seattle, Inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1973 and a J.D. from Willamette University College of Law in Oregon three years later. After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election. After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that \"Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values.\" During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious \"Green New Deal\" proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called \"the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages\" in the country. Controversy Inslee's tenures in Congress and as Washington's governor have largely been scandal-free. However, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in Washington. What Trump says Mr. Trump has yet to tweet about Inslee or his presidential aspirations. In February 2018, however, the Washington governor confronted the president in the White House about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. \"I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let's just take that off the table and move forward,\" Inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the East Room. Although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, Mr. Trump listened with his arms crossed while Inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure\n\nBernie Sanders Bernie Sanders announces 2020 run: \"We're going to win\" Biography Although he has spent most of his adult life in Vermont, Bernie Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in 1941, as part of a religiously observant Jewish family. He attended one year at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating in 1964. At the University of Chicago, Sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He moved to Vermont in 1968. Sanders ran for governor of Vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent Liberty Union Party. He was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. He was elected to the House of Representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 2006. Although technically still an independent, he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. Sanders unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. However, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign. His campaign exceeded expectations and won a number of major contests against eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Since the 2016 campaign, some of Sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the Democratic Party, such as his Medicare-for-All proposal. Issues Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. Sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against \"millionaires and billionaires\" who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. Sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the Medicare-for-All bill with 15 other senators in 2017. He also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they American worker. He opposed NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, trade deals which President Trump renegotiated or withdrew from. Sanders opposed the U.S. war in Iraq, and remains a critic of American military interventionism. Controversy More than two dozen of Sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of December seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign. A New York Times story in early January reported several incidences of sexual misconduct by staffers during the campaign, for which Sanders apologized. Politico also reported in early January that his former Iowa campaign manager, Robert Becker, had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees. Sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with Becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. What Trump says President Trump has alternated between praising Sanders and insulting him as \"crazy.\" As some of Mr. Trump and Sanders' populist ideas overlap, Mr. Trump often said during the 2016 campaign that Sanders voters would defect to him over Hillary Clinton in the general election. Mr. Trump also accused Clinton of \"cheating\" to take the nomination away from Sanders, and criticized Sanders for eventually endorsing Clinton. \"While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers,\" Mr. Trump tweeted in July 2016. \"Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary,\" he wrote in another July tweet. In several subsequent tweets, Mr. Trump has called Sanders \"Crazy Bernie.\" He has often referred to the 2016 Democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements.\n\nAmy Klobuchar Biography Amy Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota, in 1960. Klobuchar has written about her troubled family life as a child in her book, \"The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland.\" Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter. Bessler is a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The three-term Minnesota senator launched her presidential campaign on Feb. 10 under frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall in Minneapolis. Issues Klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. As of December, Klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. However, Klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. As a member of the Senate in 2009, Klobuchar voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She also has an \"F\" rating from the National Rifle Association. Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in September. At one point, when asking if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: \"Have you?\" The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. Controversy Klobuchar was the sole senator from Minnesota during the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light. \"I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way,\" Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. Klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. What Trump says A few hours after her announcement, President Trump mocked Klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a Midwestern snowstorm. \"Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!\" the president tweeted.\n\nCory Booker Cory Booker launches 2020 presidential campaign Biography Cory Booker was born in Washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from Stanford University, where he also played tight end for the football team. After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. He managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of Newark's neighborhoods. After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. \"The only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'Meet the Press,'\" Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, said when he was a councilman during Booker's mayoral administration. After longtime New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, Booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known Republican mayor in a special election. In 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the Senate. During his years in the Senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called \"war on drugs.\" The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in Congress, Booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system. Controversy Although he has a liberal voting record in the Senate and has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration, Booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. In what he touted as his \"Spartacus\" moment, Booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His Republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. What Trump says In an exclusive interview with CBS News \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan the same day Booker announced his candidacy, President Trump said he thinks Booker has \"no chance\" in the 2020 election. When asked why, Mr. Trump replied: \"Because I know him. He has no chance.\" In a November interview with the New York Post, the president said Booker \"ran Newark into the ground\" and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to know more about Booker than the New Jersey senator knew about himself. \"If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself,\" Mr. Trump tweeted in July of that year.\n\nPete Buttigieg Pete Buttigieg launches presidential exploratory committee Biography The youngest of the presidential contenders, Pete Buttigieg is also the only openly gay candidate who has jumped into the race. Buttigieg, 37, ran for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, his hometown, when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee. Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018. Issues Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction, such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets. Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing. The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. In the video announcing his exploratory committee, Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a \"fresh start\" in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: \"We're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different.\" Controversy Buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. In his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now.\n\nKamala Harris Sen. Kamala Harris kicks off 2020 presidential run with big Oakland rally Biography Harris was born in Oakland in 1964 and raised in a multicultural household. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a scientist from India and her father, Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University, was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms, Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris launched a bid for her seat. In 2016, she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill, Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called \"war on drugs.\" In October, Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail. Controversy Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a \"progressive prosecutor.\" \"If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past,\" wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, \"@SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does.\" Harris has said that lawmakers need to \"reexamine\" the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nElizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren takes formal step toward 2020 presidential candidacy Biography Warren was born in 1949 and raised in Oklahoma, where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears. She has described growing up \"in a paycheck-to-paycheck family\" that lived \"on the ragged edge of the middle class.\" Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office. Warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 31. Warren and her second husband, Bruce Mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with their golden retriever, Bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a \"rigged\" economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. \"I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster,\" Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. \"What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.\" During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. \"The problem is Washington works great for those with influence.\" Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. \"Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns,\" she told reporters. \"We make our campaigns work through the people.\" Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as \"Pocahontas,\" and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video. \"She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage. That didn't work out too well,\" Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. \"We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her.\" Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, Twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win, the president said, \"Well, that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.\"\n\nKirsten Gillibrand Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presidential bid Biography Kirsten Gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her. Gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the Senate. Issues Gillibrand advocated the repeal of the \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy on LGBT military service when she got to the Senate in 2009. She made a name for herself in the Senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a \"60 Minutes\" profile in 2018 that she was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" of her stances while serving in the House. Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. Controversy Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice. She has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the Senate. The New York senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct. She was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. A few big Democratic donors, including billionaire George Soros, have said that they will not support Gillibrand because of her position on Franken. She has also distanced herself from the Clintons. In November 2017, she said that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public. What Trump says President Trump tweeted at Gillibrand in December 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. \"Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office \"begging\" for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!\" Mr. Trump tweeted. Critics interpreted the words \"begging\" and \"used\" in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. \"You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office,\" Gillibrand wrote on Twitter in response.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro Juli\u00e1n Castro launches 2020 campaign Biography Juli\u00e1n Castro was born one minute before his identical twin brother, Joaquin, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. His mother, Maria, was a Chicana political activist whom Castro has credited for motivating him and his brother to choose careers in public service. Joaquin Castro is currently a congressman. Castro attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, along with his brother. He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won when he ran again in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro's profile rose when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so. In 2014, President Obama named Castro Housing and Urban Development secretary. During the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for Hillary Clinton, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, \"An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream,\" in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12. Castro and his wife, Erica, have two children. Castro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues. In his exit memo from the agency, Castro said that HUD had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. Under the Obama administration, he wrote, HUD invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a \"$1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects.\" Views on LGBT issues and abortion rights He supports LGBT rights and was the first San Antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's Pride Parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the \"Mayors for the Freedom to Marry\" petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012. Castro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. He spoke at the annual luncheon for Planned Parenthood South Texas in May. Controversy In 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that Castro had violated the Hatch Act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. Castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the Hatch Act in his department. What Trump says Castro has not yet been a target for President Trump. Unlike some of the other potential presidential candidates, Mr. Trump has never personally disparaged Castro on Twitter. Issues In his video announcing his exploratory committee in December, Castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants. \"No matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. The need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. We all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety,\" Castro said.\n\nTulsi Gabbard Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard launches 2020 presidential campaign Biography Tulsi Gabbard was born in American Samoa in 1981, and her family moved to Hawaii when she was 2 years old. Her mother, Carol, is a practicing Hindu, a religion Gabbard adopted. Her father, Mike, is a member of the Hawaii state Senate. After growing up in a politically active family, Gabbard became a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21 years old in 2002, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. While serving in the state legislature in 2003, she enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard. She deployed in Iraq and returned in 2006. After returning from her second deployment in 2009, Gabbard ran for Honolulu City Council. She served on the council from 2011 until 2012, when she resigned to focus on her congressional campaign. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first practicing Hindu in Congress. Issues Gabbard is very progressive, and one of the few members of Congress to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. She resigned her position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to endorse him. Gabbard is a supporter of a woman's right to an abortion and received a 100 percent rating from NARAL. She has emphasized environmental and economic issues during her tenure, and supports a $15 minimum wage. She also supports Medicare for All. Although she began her career opposing LGBTQ rights, she is now a supporter of LGBTQ issues and has apologized for her previous views. Controversy Gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. When she ran for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. \"To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii,\" Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. \"As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\" Gabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. Gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. In January 2017, she visited Syria and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A few months later, the U.S. bombed the Syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. Gabbard called the U.S. bombing reckless and questioned whether Assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other Democratic politicians. In November, she said in a tweet that President Trump is \"Saudi Arabia's bitch\" for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. What Trump says Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Gabbard. The two met briefly shortly after Mr. Trump was elected."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-to-howard-schultz-dont-do-it/", "text": "Democrats are welcoming a wide variety of potential challengers to President Trump's 2020 re-election bid \u2014 with the exception of one.\n\nIn an interview Sunday with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" Starbucks' former CEO Howard Schultz announced he is seriously considering a bid as an \"centrist\" independent. \"I've been a lifelong Democrat.

Kirsten Gillibrand's entrance into the race this week marked the first time that more than one woman competed for the party's nomination -- and still more are expected to join the fray.\n\nWhat may be more remarkable -- and welcome -- is the variety within the field of women. The fact of their sex is not a consideration in their decision to run. \"There's not a 'women's lane,'\" says Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications for Emily's List, which recruits and supports typically Democratic female candidates.

Amy Klobuchar is also seriously considering a campaign for the presidency.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton made history as the first woman presidential candidate nominated by a major political party, and she secured nearly 3 million more votes than Donald Trump in the general election, but she still lost her bid for the White House. If that election raised concerns about whether a woman can win the presidency (though there were certainly other significant factors in Clinton's loss), the 2018 midterms--which sent a record number of women to Congress--appears to have helped to put them to rest.\n\n\"Let's be crystal clear: today, women are the heart and soul of the Democratic base and the fuel that is driving victories up and down the ballot,\" Ilyse Hogue, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, recently wrote.\n\nKelly Dittmar, an associate professor at Rutgers University and a scholar at the university's Center for American Women and Politics, said that having multiple women candidates of different ages, race, and ideological positions would \"push back against the sort of homogeneous ideal type\" of a woman running for higher office.\n\n\"I think that any time we have more women running, and greater diversity among those women, it just challenges those monolithic conceptions of what it means to be a woman candidate,\" Dittmar said.\n\nBut being a woman does not mean that these candidates will be restricted to campaigning on \"women's issues,\" which are often narrowly defined by topics like paid family leave and sexual assault.\n\n\"They're not all running on being a woman. They are running on their records and their visions,\" says Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic strategist who advised Cynthia Nixon's gubernatorial campaign in 2018.\n\n\"I think it's important that we not relegate women to just one set of issues as though they aren't living full lives,\" Senator Harris told Bustle.\n\nHarris promotes her experience as a prosecutor, which could become a key pitch of her presidential campaign. Warren has built a national brand on economic issues, particularly consumer protection and Wall Street accountability. Gillibrand has made combating sexual misconduct, particularly in the military, a hallmark of her political career since entering the Senate.\n\nDittmar said that the number of women in the race would not necessarily mean introduction of new topics to the national conversation, but would provide new perspectives.\n\n\"It's more about the lens by which they're going to be viewing, talking about, and in fact creating their own policy agenda,\" she said.\n\nThose varying lenses have already been on display. During the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, she asked, \"Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\"\n\nKlobuchar also received national attention for her questioning of Kavanaugh. She discussed her own history as a child of an alcoholic father, and asked if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out while drinking. Kavanaugh retorted, \"No, have you?\" While male politicians often use their personal histories to make a point, Klobuchar presented a vulnerability in her questioning which is often missing in politics.\n\nWhen talking about economic disadvantages, Warren has invoked the story about how her aunt helped her watch her two kids while she worked. Otherwise she would have had to give up her career. \"Without child care, I was a goner. And I know how lucky I was because so many working moms don't have an Aunt Bea who can fly in and help out,\" Warren said at a keynote address to the National Women's Law Center in October.\n\nBut just because more women are running for president doesn't mean the stereotypes and other standards have disappeared. Indeed, the \"likeability\" factor that has long been a pesky measure disproportionately applied to women candidates, mustered its way to the national conversation early on.\n\nWarren, to whom critics have drawn misguided comparisons to Clinton, took the issue head on. \"I hear women candidates are most likable in the quiet car!\" she tweeted from her seat on the Acela.\n\nGillibrand has also drawn comparisons to Clinton, as another blonde senator from New York. Clinton was often criticized as shrill and unlikeable, and female presidential candidates are already drawing unwelcome comparisons. Dittmar said that comparing current women candidates to past ones -- and to each other -- showed how women are still considered outliers in the political field.\n\n\"We never assume that Mitt Romney was John McCain,\" Dittmar said, referring to the 2012 and 2008 Republican candidates for president. \"We assume and allow greater individuality and separation among male candidates than among women candidates.\"\n\nDuring a book tour stop at The View, Harris was asked about the \"likeability\" factor.\n\n\"Despite a woman's role in the world, there are still certain myths of what a woman can and cannot do,\" she said.\n\nSill, at least one candidate plans to lean into a gender archetype during her campaign: Gillibrand is aiming to carve out a niche in the crowded field by embracing the gender issue. \"I'm going to run for president of the United States because as a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own,\" she said on the Colbert show."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brett-mcgurk-top-u-s-envoy-in-isis-fight-to-quit/", "text": "Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, had been planning to exit his post in February 2019.

According to Barzani's office, he had raised concern about the fate of Kurds in Syria including the Kurdish-led group of fighters known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). They have been the ground troops in the fight against ISIS and receive help from U.S. advisers, weapons and air strikes.\n\nIt is now unclear what will happen to those fighters after the U.S. troops withdraw, and whether the U.S. will continue to carry out air strikes in support of them.\n\nBrett McGurk listens to questions from reporter during a Pentagon briefing May 19, 2017 in Arlington, Virginia.

He told reporters that ISIS inhabited just one percent of the territory they once held thanks to the success of the U.S.-led campaign but still maintained a dangerous level of influence.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring.\"\n\nMcGurk went on to say, \"it would be reckless if we were just to say, well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now. I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.\"\n\nAt the time he made those remarks, the Trump administration's policy was to remain in Syria to help stabilize areas under the control of U.S. allies and until Iran pulled out its militias. American allies were shocked to learn via tweet that the U.S. was pulling out.\n\nMcGurk has led U.S. efforts to counter the influence of ISIS on the battlegrounds of Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond since 2015. He was one of the few Obama appointees asked by the Trump team to remain in his post. Prior to that, he served in the Bush administration.\n\nMcGurk also led the successful and controversial secret negotiations with Iran that led to the 2016 release of American prisoners, including Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian.\n\nWhile President Trump has been harshly critical of his predecessor's decision to authorize that prisoner swap, he has left at least five Americans imprisoned in Tehran including 82-year-old Baquer Namazi.\n\nMcGurk's resignation takes effect December 31.

His practice does hundreds of these procedures each year.\n\nA lobectomy involves removing a lobe of the lung. There are five lobes in the lungs, three on the right and two on the left, Flores explained.

She was treated for colon cancer in 1999 with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.\n\nBecause of this history, Flores said it's likely that slow-moving cancer cells from one of those cases spread to her lungs.

Flores said patients typically return to their everyday activities, including work, in about six weeks, though at 85, there's a chance Ginsburg's age might delay that timetable.\n\nHowever, her notoriously vigorous workout routine will likely be beneficial to a faster recovery, he said.\n\nWhile Flores said the full pathology report is needed for a clearer picture of Ginsburg's health, if she continues to be free of cancer, her \"prognosis would be excellent,\" he said. \"I don't see her checking out any time.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ruth-bader-ginsburg-lung-cancer-nodules-removed-supreme-court-justice-2018-12-21/", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent surgery Friday to remove two cancerous nodules from her lung.

The justice, 85, was hospitalized in November after she fell in her office and broke three ribs. Ginsburg is notorious for maintaining a strenuous exercise regime, but recent health scares such as the broken ribs and Friday's surgeries raise questions about her health and ability to remain on the court.\n\nDr. Raja Flores, chair of thoracic surgery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, told CBS News that since Ginsburg survived pancreatic and colon cancer, it's likely that slow-moving cancer cells from one of those diagnoses spread to her lungs.

He predicted she will be able to \"live normally\" and \"won't miss that part of the lung.\"\n\nBut for Ginsburg, surgery is the easy part, and recovery will be tougher. Flores estimated that she would stay in the hospital 3-6 days and should be up and walking in the next day or so. Typically he would expect someone who had her procedure to return to work in 6 weeks. Her history of routine exercise will be beneficial to a faster recovery.\n\n\"I think she's gonna be fine,\" Flores said.\n\nHe also praised Dr. Valerie Rusch, the surgeon who performed the procedure. \"She couldn't be in better hands,\" he said. Rusch and Flores were partners at Memorial Sloan Kettering for ten years.\n\nPresident Trump has appointed two justices to the Supreme Court, filling seats vacated by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and retirement of moderate conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy.

The wall was a signature campaign promise for Mr. Trump, a slogan and a rallying cry for his supporters. The Trump administration was going to build the wall, Mr. Trump was fond of saying, and Mexico was going to pay for it.\n\nHowever, in his two years in office, the wall has failed to materialize. Mr. Trump has claimed falsely in rallies that the wall was already being built, and that Congress has already partially funded it. In fact, repairs are continuing on existing pieces of fence on the border, and only the House has passed a bill to fund the wall. Now, Mr. Trump has staked a partial government shutdown on the wall, refusing to sign a spending bill unless wall funding is included.\n\nBut the wall is no longer the wall. His description of the wall he imagined when he was a candidate is evolving. In 2015, Mr. Trump said of his wall, \"It's going to be made of hardened concrete, and it's going to be made out of rebar, and steel.\" Since Thursday, Mr. Trump has taken to referring to the proposed structure as \"steel slats,\" and in one tweet, he suggested they would have a certain aesthetic quality.\n\n\"The Democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it,\" he tweeted earlier this week.\n\nOn Friday, as he talked about the House vote Thursday, he mentioned the slats again as he praised the GOP for \"approving strong border security and the money necessary to take care of the barrier wall or steel slats.\"\n\nHe has been consistent about wanting a transparent quality in his southern barrier, though. Speaking to reporters in July 2017, Mr. Trump said that the wall \"has to be transparent,\" in order to see what is happening on the other side.\n\nIn this Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, photo, a bird rests on a section of 18-foot high border fence in Brownsville, Texas. The idea of a concrete wall spanning the entire 1,954-mile southwest frontier collides head-on with multiple realities, like a looping Rio Grande, fierce local resistance, and cost.

They hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? It's over,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. He doubled down on the need for a transparent wall in a trip to San Diego in March to see prototypes for the wall.\n\nThe \"steel slats\" sound somewhat similar to the fences erected during the President George W. Bush administration. A 2016 Associated Press report described the existing border structures as \"fragmented series of fencing, composed of enormous steel bars embedded in concrete close together\" which \"must reach a height of 18ft loom over the landscape.\" There are significant gaps between these fences, however.\n\nMr. Trump has now started referring to the wall and steel slats interchangeably. On Thursday, he tweeted that the \"Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security.\" He reiterated this point at a bill signing on Friday.\n\n\"Whatever you want to call it, it's all the same,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted a picture of the proposed \"Steel Slat Barrier\" Friday evening, calling it \"totally effective while at the same time beautiful!\" The picture appears to be very similar to existing border fencing."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-congress-youngest-woman-democrat-bernie-sanders/", "text": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be the youngest woman ever elected into Congress following her midterm election win Tuesday.

So what is QAnon, and why are we talking about something this ridiculous?\n\nThe story of Q\n\nThose who subscribe to the QAnon conspiracy theory believe that a person who posts messages on the 4Chan and 8Chan internet message boards under the name \"Q\" is a high-ranking government official. And according to Q, Mr. Trump is on the verge of exposing a cabal of pedophiles, globalists, and celebrities who secretly control America.\n\nSupporters of President Trump shout down a CNN news crew before a rally Tuesday, July 31, 2018, in Tampa, Fla. AP\n\nThat's the central gist of the theory, anyway. The rest is open to some degree of interpretation, which is necessary because Q's posts tend to read like riddles. But YouTube videos created by QAnon believers help fill in the gaps and create a storyline that's more-or-less comprehensible.\n\nQAnon exists as a kind of parallel history which a \"deep state\" took over decades ago. An all-encompassing theory of the world, it's able to tie together and explain everything from \"Pizzagate\" to ISIS to the prevalence of mass shootings and the JFK assassination.\n\nMany Q fans believe that President Kennedy was set to reveal the existence of the secret government when he was assassinated. They also believe President Reagan was shot on the deep state's orders, and that all the presidents since he left office -- with the exception of Mr. Trump -- have been deep state agents.\n\nThe military, eager to see the deep state overthrown, recruited Mr. Trump to run for president. But the deep state, which controls the media, quickly tried to smear him through \"fake news\" and unfounded allegations of collusion with Russia.\n\nDespite the deep state's best efforts, however, Mr. Trump is winning. Q is releasing sanctioned leaks to the public in order to galvanize them ahead of \"The Storm,\" which is the moment when the deep state's leaders are arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay. Q's adherents have called this process \"the great awakening.\"\n\nEnter \"the storm\"\n\nThe storm takes its name from Mr. Trump enigmatic comment last October about \"the calm before the storm.\" Q began posting soon after, and said that the storm Mr. Trump referenced are a coming series of mass arrests that would end the deep state forever.\n\nIn QAnon lore, Mr. Trump is secretly working with special counsel Robert Mueller to bring the deep state down, and the storm is a kind of Judgment Day to in which the evildoers are punished and the faithful are redeemed. Q has repeatedly suggested that the storm would hit in the very near future, and has even said certain people would be arrested at certain dates. When those dates come and go without any arrests, Q says that they needed to be delayed for one reason or another, but that Mr. Trump still has the situation well in hand.\n\nBakers and breadcrumbs\n\nQ's posts tend to be either vague or totally incomprehensible, but QAnon fans are more than happy to try and decipher them. Last year, for example, Q posted a photo of an unnamed island chain. Eager to divine the reasoning behind the post, QAnon adherents tried to prove that the photo must have been taken on Air Force One, which in turn meant that Q was traveling with the president.\n\nThe Q posts are known to the faithful as \"breadcrumbs.\" The people who then try to figure out what they mean are called \"bakers.\" According to The Daily Beast's Will Sommer, QAnon adherents also spend a lot of time trying to figure out who in the government is a \"white hat\" Trump supporter and who is a \"black hat\" in league with the deep state. Their rallying cry is \"where we go one, we go all,\" a line from the 1996 Jeff Bridges sailing adventure \"White Squall\" that they misattribute to President Kennedy.\n\nThe phrase is frequently abbreviated to \"WWG1WGA,\" which Roseanne Barr -- one of several celebrity QAnon promoters -- tweeted in June.

But who's behind the posts is anybody's guess. According to Sommer, the QAnon faithful sometimes point to former national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House aide Dan Scavino as possibilities. Others believe it's Mr. Trump himself.

Kennedy Jr. faked his death and now posts on 8Chan as QAnon."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-a-president-be-indicted/", "text": "So, can a president be indicted?\n\nThis is one of those tricky legal questions with no easy answer. Scholars are divided on the issue, and it's never been definitively settled. But Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, says that a president cannot be indicted, and he says that special counsel Robert Mueller's office agrees with that assessment. However, Mueller's team has not confirmed what its opinion is on the matter.\n\nWhy is it so tricky?\n\nFor one thing, the Constitution is not exactly explicit on the issue, and the Supreme Court has never ruled either way. A president can be impeached, but whether one can be indicted is still a topic of debate. \"It's a fascinating question and I don't think there is a clear answer,\" Scott L. Frederickson, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News.\n\nOn one side of the debate you have people like Yale professor Akhil Reed Amar, who told The New York Times last year that the framers of the Constitution \"implicitly immunized a sitting president from ordinary criminal prosecution.\" This does seem to be the prevailing view among legal scholars, and they may have The Federalist Papers to back them up.\n\nIn Federalist 69, Alexander Hamilton wrote that the president \"would be liable to be impeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.\" But Jonathan Turley, a prominent professor at George Washington University, argues that this line is taken out of context.\n\nIn a piece for The Washington Post last year, Turley said that those relying on the line from Federalist 69 are missing its broader point. According to Turley, Hamilton \"was not expounding on inherent immunity and would hardly be making such an implied argument in an essay designed to quell concerns over presidential powers.\" Instead, Turley argues, Hamilton was explaining that the president, unlike the British monarch, was not above the law and \"could be stripped of his office and still prosecuted under the Constitution.\"\n\nBut beyond what the founders intended, there's a practical question as to whether it's wise to allow a president to be indicted.\n\nWhy would that be a problem?\n\n\"The basic point is that prosecutors should not be able to tie up the work of a president,\" Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under the Obama administration, told CBS News. \"Imagine, for example, that a South Carolina prosecutor had tried to indict Abraham Lincoln in 1864. It would allow a prosecutor from one state to undermine the national will. But federal prosecutors are not amenable to quite the same criticism.\"\n\nThis view was articulated in 1973 by the Justice Department, which insisted that indicting a president would \"hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs.\" In 2000, the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) came to a similar conclusion, stating that the \"indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting president would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.\"\n\nRegardless of his personal legal opinion, Mueller may be bound by the OLC's ruling on the matter, Fredericksen says, because it remains an official opinion of the Department of Justice. If Mueller ever attempted to indict Mr. Trump anyway, the president's lawyers would surely argue that the OLC opinion prevents him from doing so.\n\nBut would that mean that the president is above the law?\n\nThis is where it gets tricky again. \"A fundamental tenet of our political and criminal justice system is that no man is above the law,\" Fredericksen says. For that reason, he says that there \"is a very persuasive argument that can be made that you can indict a sitting president.\"\n\nStaffers working for Ken Starr, the independent counsel during the Clinton years, wrote a 56-page memo in 1998 arguing that the rule of law demands that a president can be indicted. And Turley argued that the \"dysfunctionality caused by presidential immunity should be a greater concern for citizens than the constitutional crisis brought on by an indictment. An indicted president is a terrible proposition. But so is the continuation of a presumed felon in office \u2014 one who clings to power as a shield from accountability.\"\n\nThe stated Constitutional remedy for presidential lawbreaking is impeachment. But only Congress has the power to impeach, and if the president's party also controls the House and Senate, they could instead protect the president from any consequences. \"If a president is immune, his supporters in Congress could prevent his removal while the statute of limitations runs out on certain crimes,\" Turley wrote.\n\n\"Conversely, if Congress is shielding the president, an indictment can force him to address his crimes.\"\n\nIs there some kind of compromise solution to this issue?\n\nThere is, namely a scenario where a president is indicted but the trial is delayed until he or she leaves the White House. \"One of the ways around the concern of indicting a sitting president and interfering with his ability to execute the functions of the office is one can indict and the trial can be delayed until the president leaves office,\" Freidrickson says. \"I think that could be an approach that [a special counsel] could take as well...obviously they can indict others and name the president as an unindicted co-conspirator, which is what [Watergate special prosecutor] Leon Jaworski did with President Nixon.\"\n\nKatyal agrees that the former is a worthwhile solution to the problem. \"Probably the strongest position, which former Solicitors General Walter Dellinger and Ted Olson have put forth, is that a sitting president can be indicted, but cannot be tried until he leaves office,\" he told CBS News. \"Of course, impeachment may be one way to hasten a president's departure from office, so there is a way in which impeachment works together with the Dellinger/Olson view.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-trump-nuclear-weapons-powers-unchecked/", "text": "South Korea's spy agency says North Korea may conduct more ballistic missile tests by the end of the year to boost its ability to threaten the U.S. Meanwhile, Democrats are asking questions about President Trump's authority to launch nuclear weapons.\n\nThe White House considers anxiety about the president's temperament and nuclear weapons misplaced, reports CBS News correspondent Major Garrett.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said the short time available to respond to a nuclear attack or one that may be imminent gives the commander-in-chief special power.\n\n\"The president has to hold in his hands the sole decision to use our nuclear weapons,\" Cotton said Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nSince the Cold War, U.S. presidents have had sole authority to launch nuclear weapons. The codes to do so follow the president in a suitcase: the nuclear football.\n\n\"No one human being should ever have that power,\" Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said.\n\nNow some Senate Democrats want a say in preemptive nuclear war, drafting a bill requiring Congress declare war first.\n\n\"The president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said.\n\nThe hearing where Murphy spoke was the first of its kind since 1976, when Congress learned in the weeks before he resigned President Nixon was sometimes drunk and depressed, raising alarms about nuclear launch powers and instability in the Oval Office. Mr. Trump's advisers says it is all more stable now and that diplomatic and economic pressure against North Korea remains the first priority.\n\n"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-gets-a-trump-pardon/", "text": "President Trump on Thursday pardoned a conservative commentator he claims \"was treated very unfairly by our government!\" and announced he's thinking about clemency for Martha Stewart and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, among \"lots\" of other people.\n\n\"What they did to him was horrible,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking of his decision to clear the name of Dinesh D'Souza, who had pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud.\n\nIt was the latest example of Mr. Trump trying to right a perceived wrong with his presidential pardon power, and a move that makes ever clearer that, in the Trump administration, the odds of a pardon have heavily favored those with a celebrity backer, those who have become a cause celebre among conservatives and those with a reality TV connection.\n\nMr. Trump has been particularly drawn to cases where he believes there was a political motivation to the prosecutions \u2014 a situation that may remind him of his own predicament at the center of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling, which he insists is nothing but a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nLongtime associate of Mr. Trump, Roger Stone, told the Washington Post the president's recent pardons are a \"signal\" to former campaign aides who have been charged with crimes.\n\n\"It has to be a signal to Mike Flynn and Paul Manafort and even Robert S. Mueller III: Indict people for crimes that don't pertain to Russian collusion and this is what could happen,\" Stone told the Post. \"The special counsel has awesome powers, as you know, but the president has even more awesome powers.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was seriously considering commuting the sentence of Blagojevich, the Democratic former governor serving a 14-year prison sentence on numerous counts of corruption, including trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat that was vacated by Barack Obama. The president also said he was considering a pardon for Stewart, the celebrity lifestyle guru who served a stint in federal prison after being convicted of charges related to a stock sale.\n\nBoth had connections to Mr. Trump's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" reality television show: Blagojevich was a contestant in 2010 and Stewart hosted the 2005 spinoff series, \"The Apprentice: Martha Stewart.\" The president said as much on Thursday.\n\n\"Rod Blagojevich -- 18 years in jail for being stupid and saying things that every other politician, you know that many other politicians say,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"And if you look at what he said he said something to the effect like what do I get ... stupid thing to say. But he's sort of saying ... he's gonna make a U.S. senator, which is a very big deal. And it was foolish ...18 years now. I don't know him other than that he was on 'The Apprentice' for a short period of time.\"\n\nStewart, the president said, was once his \"biggest fan in the world.\"\n\n\"I think to a certain extent Martha Stewart was harshly and unfairly treated,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And she used to be my biggest fan in the world.\"\n\nHours earlier, Mr. Trump said on Twitter he would pardon D'Souza. An outspoken critic of Obama, D'Souza claimed his prosecution by the Obama Justice Department was politically motivated.\n\nMr. Trump has issued five pardons as president: The first went to former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, a top Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign, who was spared the prospect of serving jail time after a conviction stemming from his use of racially targeted immigration patrols. Next came Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who had taken photos of classified portions of a submarine. Mr. Trump often mentioned Saucier's case on the campaign trail as he criticized his former Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, for her use of a private email server. Saucier had claimed his prosecution was driven by sensitivity about classified information driven by Clinton's case.\n\nNext came former White House aide I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby. A former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, Libby was convicted of lying to investigators and obstruction of justice following the 2003 leak of the covert identity of a CIA officer. The Libby case was taken up by conservatives who argued he was the victim of an overly zealous and politically motivated prosecution by a special counsel.\n\nThat pardon, especially, was seen as a sign that Mr. Trump might be willing to pardon former aides caught up in the Mueller inquiry.\n\nMr. Trump has also been moved by cases championed by celebrities. Last week, he pardoned Jack Johnson, boxing's first black heavyweight champion, whose case had been brought to his attention by actor Sylvester Stallone. And on Wednesday, he met with reality TV star Kim Kardashian, who urged him to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence for drug offenses.\n\nMr. Trump's predecessors largely relied on a formal, Department of Justice process to identify those deserving of clemency.\n\nNone of the clemencies that Mr. Trump has granted have come through the front door of the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney, which typically assists the president in exercising his pardon power. Instead they've been brought to the president by White House lawyers, advisers and outside confidants and celebrities, according to a senior White House official, who said there are dozens of pardons currently under consideration by White House attorneys and the president.\n\nThe official said Mr. Trump has prioritized actions that have personally affected him \u2014 noting he's been particularly drawn to cases where he believes there was political motivation to the prosecutions.\n\nIn its latter years, the Obama administration searched for candidates like nonviolent drug offenders and those affected by mandatory minimum sentencing policies, viewing clemency as a tool to promote policy goals. There is no such systematic review by the Trump White House.\n\nBut White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was unfair to suggest the only people winning pardons under Trump are those connected to him or with a celebrity backer.\n\n\"Certainly, something has to be brought to his attention and if somebody has the ability to do that it would help, but the president is making decisions based on the merits of the individual cases and what he thinks is the right thing to do,\" she said. \"There's a process, but ultimately the president has the power and the authority to make a decision and he does.\"\n\nSince the beginning of his presidency through May 7, Mr. Trump received 570 requests for pardons and about 2,306 requests for commutation of sentences. But because there were pending requests at the end of the Obama administration, the total number of requests for pardons pending before Trump is 2,271 and 8,932 for commutation.\n\nMr. Trump has denied dozens of pardon and commutation requests, while thousands of petitions have been closed without presidential action.\n\nKevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which worked with the Justice Department during the Obama administration to help identify candidates for clemency, said that many are torn over Mr. Trump's decision-making process, which appears to be more haphazard than in the past.\n\n\"Nobody wants to criticize displays of mercy because we think they're so sorely lacking, but most of these wouldn't be on anyone's 'Top 10' list of people who have been mistreated by the system,\" Ring said.\n\nOthers were more critical. \"The president's ad hoc use of the pardon power is concerning enough. But the possibility that he may also be sending a message to witnesses in a criminal investigation into his campaign is extremely dangerous,\" tweeted Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters Thursday that no one asked him to pardon D'Souza. But D'Souza told the conservative Daily Caller that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas played a key role.\n\nD'Souza said that during a dinner about a month ago, Cruz said he would push for a pardon in conversations with Trump. D'Souza said Cruz called him recently to tell him Mr. Trump was receptive to the idea and action could be imminent.\n\nD'Souza, whose case had become a cause in conservative circles, was sentenced to five years' probation in 2014 after pleading guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a U.S. Senate campaign in the names of others.\n\nWatchdog groups criticized D'Souza's pardon, saying it signaled contempt for the rule of law.\n\n\"Donald Trump has sent a message to his friends and cronies that if you break laws to protect him or attack our democracy, he's got your back,\" said David Donnelly, president and CEO of Every Voice.\n\nMr. Trump is not the only president to draw flak for his pardon decisions. Former President Bill Clinton ignited a major controversy with a last-minute pardon for fugitive financier Marc Rich, the ex-husband of a major Democratic fundraiser. And Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon for his involvement in the Watergate scandal just days after taking over from his predecessor.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Lemire aboard Air Force One, Zeke Miller and Kevin Vineys in Washington, and Michael Tarm in Chicago contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/commentary-george-h-w-bush-was-too-moderate-for-the-gop-base/", "text": "Amid the well-deserved celebration of an American life well-lived, I have an uncomfortable confession to make, as a lifelong conservative.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of President George H. W. Bush.\n\nOf the man\u2014yes. As a husband, a father, a citizen dedicated to service, the 41st president is a person every American should admire and emulate.\n\nBut as the 41st President of the United States? No. And that was a sentiment shared by many of my fellow conservatives.\n\nDuring my talk radio days, I would often refer to myself as a \"Jesse Jackson Republican,\" followed by an audio clip of Rev. Jackson's speech at the DNC in 2000 in which he led the crowd in a chant of \"Stay out the Bushes! Stay out the Bushes!\"\n\nThe conservative talk radio audience got it. It's not that movement conservatives hated Bush '41 the way they hated other problematic Republicans, like the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona or more recently, Sen. Jeff Flake. But conservatives understood that, in the fight for an ideological GOP, as opposed to a pragmatic one, the Bushes were on the other team. On one side -- the tax-cutting, small-government, socially-conservative Reagan Right. On the other -- the elitist, East-Coast accommodationist moderates. Or as conservatives know them: \"Bushies.\" Or \"squishes.\" Or, as H.W. himself was (somewhat unfairly) labelled, \"wimp.\"\n\nThe battle goes back at least as far as Bush v. Reagan in the 1980 GOP presidential primary.\n\nThen, Bush was the candidate of the elite, establishment East Coast GOP. Reagan was the candidate of the conservative, working-class Republicans in the South and West. It's often forgotten, but Bush actually beat Reagan in seven contests in 1980, mostly in the Northeast. In fact, Reagan came in third in the Massachusetts primary that year\u2014a point of pride among Reagan Republicans ever since.\n\nThe battle between conservatives and moderates continued through the Reagan presidency. Many on the Right saw Reagan's endorsement of Bush in 1988 as an act of loyalty, rather than a seal of ideological approval. They believed the he still was the Establishment moderate he'd always been.\n\nAnd when he was sworn in as president, he promptly proved them right.\n\nThe iconic moment was when Bush broke his \"no new taxes\" pledge, of course, but that was far from the only trouble between Bush '41 and the GOP base. Many conservatives were put off by his call for a \"kinder, gentler nation,\" the implication being that America during the Reagan years was somehow unkind or mean-spirited.\n\nConservatives were used to hearing that argument from Democrats, an argument they countered by pointing out the surge in household income during the Reagan boom for low-income and minority families. But to hear it from their own Republican president?\n\nThe Bush '41 administration also undid a great deal of the deregulation of the free-market Reagan years, adding so many new rules that President Bush himself felt the need to issue a 90-day moratorium on new regulations in 1992.\n\nAnd then there was Bush's call for a \"new world order\" after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Sure, it might have been the right geopolitical move, but it was a notion that never sat well with the \"America First\" wing of the GOP.\n\nAdd it all together, and President Bush all but invited a primary challenge\u2014which he got from an unlikely source. Pat Buchanan, a newspaper columnist and TV talking head, threw is hat in the ring, representing (he claimed) the real Reagan legacy. Running on the tax issue and concerns about job losses from unfair foreign trade (sound familiar?), Buchanan got nearly 40 percent of the vote in the 1992 New Hampshire primary.\n\nThis was the seminal moment for the post-Reagan Republican Party: The party leadership and donor class could acknowledge the divide between their college-educated, affluent suburban voters and their rural, culturally-conservative ones. They could have crafted a political platform and approach that addressed some of those issues in a way that said in actions what George H. W. Bush said so inartfully during the 1992 campaign, \"Message: I care.\"\n\nBut did he? Did he and the rest of the GOP Establishment care about the issues that their party's base did? Issues like the negative impacts of trade and globalization. Or mass illegal immigration. Or the cultural war that Americans with traditional values felt was being waged against them.\n\nThese issues didn't resonate with the Bushes\u2014or the McCains or the Romneys. Many in the base believed that these elite Republicans agreed with the New York Times that people in polite society didn't discuss such things -- other than from a progressive point of view. President Bush was never going to be a warrior for the Right in the cultural battles of American politics.\n\nAnd maybe that's a big reason why he's being so highly praised in his passing."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/commentary-could-republicans-hold-the-house-in-2018-yes/", "text": "Could Republicans hold the House in the upcoming midterms? Don't be ridiculous! The odds are awful. History is against them. The polls are all pointing the other way. There's a better chance of an adulterous, loud-mouthed reality TV star being elected president of the United States...\n\nOops.\n\nIn the bright light of day, Democrats appear to have a lock on taking control of the House of Representatives. But as they drift off to complacency, Donald Trump's victory\u2014a win that virtually nobody saw coming\u2014still haunts Democrats' dreams.\n\nAccording to the data-crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com, the odds that the GOP will hold onto the 218 seats they need for a majority in the House are just 1-in-7. A slim 15 percent. These same polling experts, by the way, gave Donald Trump just a 1-in-4 chance of winning the White House.\n\nBut when angry Democrats demanded an explanation from FiveThirtyEight's chief guru, Nate Silver, for getting the 2016 race so wrong, he insisted that he hadn't. \"Things with a 1-in-4 chance of happening happen all the time,\" he noted. And he's right.\n\nAs David Byler, chief elections analyst at the Weekly Standard pointed out to me, a 15 percent probability \"isn't so far off the probability of rolling a one on a six-sided die -- so it's definitely not what you should bet on, but it's far from unthinkable.\"\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that a Democratic win is all but certain, and it's easy to see why: Democrats are raising money at a record pace and outpacing Republicans by a 2-1 margin; the \"generic ballot\" question continues to show a Democratic lead, and President Trump is underwater in virtually all of the swing states where Republicans are struggling to hold onto House seats. Add in the broader historic trend of the party winning the White House doing poorly in the first midterm two years later, and that's how pollsters get to a 85 percent chance that Nancy Pelosi will be picking out new curtains for the Speaker's office. (Assuming Democrats make her speaker again, but that's another story\u2026)\n\nBut what about that 1-in-7 chance? What would have to happen for Republicans to roll snake eyes and sneak by with a win? Here are three reasons why the race for control of the House isn't over:\n\nRepublican motivation is real\n\n\"What we're seeing in our polling the past two weeks is that Democratic enthusiasm hasn't kept pace with Republicans,\" says Brett Loyd, President and CEO of the Polling Company. \"In early September, the Democrats' generic-ballot advantage was around 10 points. Now it's down around 7 percent. Democrats just haven't been winning the news cycles of late.\"\n\nJim Geraghty, who tracks political races for the conservative National Review, acknowledges that about 15 GOP house incumbents are already \"Dead Members Walking,\" but points out that there are a handful of races (CA 39, FL 27, WA 8) where Republicans are proving to be stubbornly strong. And, he says \"remember that if the Democrats pick up 20 seats \u2014 usually a good year \u2014 the result is still a small GOP majority.\"\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, a key player for the GOP during the 2008 campaign when Democrats ran the table, told the Washington Post that this time is different. \"They were resigned in '08. I think the mood now is we have a real shot.\"\n\nDemocratic turnout is uncertain\n\nThere are multiple reports that interest in the midterm election is at a record high. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds nearly two-thirds of registered voters have a high level of interest in the midterms\u2014the highest ever recorded in the Journal/ABC poll for a midterm.\n\nBut \"interest\" isn't the same as \"turnout.\" And as CBS News pollster Anthony Salvanto points out, the turnout models giving Democrats a big win in the house rely on whether \"low-propensity voters who tell us they are going to vote Democratic this year follow through and vote.\" They might\u2026but they might not. The GOP, meanwhile, does best among older, white voters who have some of the highest voter turnout percentages.\n\nIn addition, some of the seats Democrats need to flip are suburban districts where the percentage of these \"low-propensity voters\" \u2014 younger voters, minority voters\u2014aren't as large a segment of the population. \"Remember that in the late-breaking Senate races in 2014, when Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Pat Roberts of Kansas seemed to be in real danger, they ended up winning with solid margins,\" says Michael Barone, co-founder of the Almanac of American Politics. \"That's because voters outside the major metro areas gave them big margins on Election Day.\"\n\nAnd then there's this: While Democrats lead in the generic poll (\"Which party would you rather have controlling Congress\"), the latest CBS News poll actually finds that the GOP is slightly more popular\u2014or perhaps more accurately, \"less unpopular\"\u2014as a party than the Democrats, with a 40 percent favorability vs. the Democrats' 38 percent. It's a slim advantage, but given the media coverage and the assumption of a Republican collapse, still a surprising one.\n\nTrump is peaking at the right time\n\n\"The key to the GOP pulling off a surprise win in the House is that President Trump's approval appears to be surging at the right time in our averages,\" says Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics. That average has the president's approval above 44 percent, which is definitely on his historic high end. Meanwhile, the new WSJ/NBC poll has his job approval up to 47 percent.\n\nLoyd believes it's because voters are finally starting to focus on the fundamentals, like the economy. \"The right track/wrong track numbers have been improving, the consumer confidence numbers are way up, and 60 percent of adults believe their children will be better off than they are. This is movement in the right direction,\" Loyd said.\n\nIn fact, in the latest CBS News poll, 70 percent of Americans say the economy is doing well, the highest number since the tech bubble of 1998.\n\nPresident Trump is making a very simple pitch: \"Democrats produce mobs. Republicans produce jobs.\" He's also seizing on the scenes of thousands of migrants marching north from Central American toward the U.S. border. Democrats may completely disagree with Trump's views on these two issues, but there's little doubt they both play to his strengths.\n\nAnd just in time for an election two short weeks away.\n\nRepublicans holding the House is still a long-shot bet. But their odds may not be quite as long as Nancy Pelosi would like."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/commentary-time-for-bill-clinton-to-go-away/", "text": "Why doesn't he just go away? He has had his moment in history, he has done his work, he has won the applause and borne the calumny...can't he just leave?\n\nBill Clinton won't, of course. Perhaps taking a page from his old foe Newt Gingrich, Clinton is now trying his hand at schlock fiction. His new book, co-written with James Patterson, is called \"The President is Missing.\" Would that it were true. But once again, Bill Clinton is everywhere.\n\nClinton says, in Clintonian fashion, that the titular president of his book is not based on him. \"We didn't design it to be me,\" William Jefferson Clinton told CBS' Mo Rocca of his protagonist, Jonathan Lincoln Duncan, who in the book is staring down impeachment proceedings while going undercover to foil a terrorist plot.\n\n\"The transfiguration of William Jefferson Clinton into Jonathan Lincoln Duncan should be studied in psych departments for years,\" The Washington Post writes in its lukewarm review of the novel. \"Both men lost their fathers early and rose from hardscrabble circumstances to become governors. Both men met their brilliant wives in law school, and both couples have one daughter.\"\n\nThe key difference between Duncan and Clinton, the Post notes, is that the fictional one is a decorated veteran, while the real life president ducked service in Vietnam. There's also this detail: \"[R]ather than being the subject of innumerable rumors about extramarital affairs, Duncan was wholly devoted to his late wife and now lives in apparent celibacy.\"\n\nSo Duncan is basically Bill Clinton except he's a rugged veteran with a dead wife who moonlights as an action hero. Also, he never has sex. This is the alternate history version of himself that Clinton has conjured up: Just like the man himself, only tougher, and without the lechery.\n\nIs lechery too kind a word? In reality, he was a predator, who survived and prospered like so many of his kind in the 1990s. Back then, making a big deal of Clinton's infidelities was portrayed as nothing more than sexual puritanism. The investigations into Clinton's appetites, which the liberal commentariat of the time argued were perfectly normal and even healthy, was compared by no less than Arthur Miller to the witch hunts of the 17th century.\n\n\"Witch hunt\" has a different connotation today, what with our funhouse mirror vision of the Clinton presidency that Donald Trump has given us. Trump has his own history of awful, predatory behavior toward women, but the Democrats realized too late that Hillary Clinton was not the best person they had to make the moralistic case against him. If you spent the 1990s arguing that what Clinton did was the ordinary foibles of an all-too-human president, it's hard to argue that Trump's own grossness makes him unfit to serve.\n\nAs Business Insider's Josh Barro has convincingly argued, the Clintons also normalized the casual corruption that Trump and his family so gleefully indulge in. Democrats, believing that it was necessary to defend the Clintons at all costs, not only excused their extensive financial conflicts of interests, but insisted that people who found them to be lacking in the ethics department did not understand that this is how politics works, and has always worked.\n\nBut Bill Clinton, it has been said, lacks whatever gene it is that produces shame in normal humans. He may understand that his presidency would have been easier if he had restrained himself, but when Monica Lewinsky came up during his Monday interview with NBC's Today, he quickly became his defensive, evasive, self-pitying self.\n\n\"Do you think President Kennedy should have resigned?\" he asked the interviewer. \"Do you think President Johnson should have resigned?\" It's the same old defense they always deploy: everyone does it, so why pick on the Clintons? The \"Today\" segment was far from a grilling of the man very credibly accused of rape by Juanita Broaddrick \u2013 her name and allegation went unmentioned. Still, Clinton appeared upset, even indignant, by the line of questioning.\n\nCertain in his mind that he is the real victim of his affair with Lewinsky, he will never ask for redemption or personally apologize for his part in the hell she went through. He wishes it was still the 1990s, when he got a free pass, but he wants you to know just how much he welcomes the #MeToo movement. He wants you to buy his book and reminisce with him about the good times, and hopes that you'll allow him to reimagine them ever so slightly.\n\nA better Bill Clinton would not be out hawking beach reads right now. He'd be on his knees cleaning a toilet with a toothbrush in a shelter, which is how John Profumo spent much of his later life.\n\nProfumo, the British secretary of war under Prime Minister Harold MacMillan, became synonymous with sex scandals when Clinton was still in high school. He'd had an affair with a London escort whose clientele included the top Soviet spy in the U.K. at the time, and then lied about it to the House of Commons. The resulting scandal led to fall of MacMillan's government, and Profumo spent the rest of his life humbled and doing good works in obscurity.\n\nThis is more than we can expect for the best of our disgraced politicians, let alone Bill Clinton. But failing that, he could do us all a favor, particularly his fellow liberals, and just disappear."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-will-call-for-venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-to-step-down-in-colombia-speech-monday/", "text": "Washington \u2014 Vice President Michael Pence will call for the ouster of embattled Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro next week during a high-profile visit to Colombia, a staunch U.S. ally which shares a border with Venezuela and has taken in more than a million refugees from its crisis-stricken neighbor.\n\nPence will travel to Colombia on Feb. 25 to reiterate the American government's support for National Assembly President Juan Guaid\u00f3, which the U.S. and dozens of countries have recognized as Venezuela's interim president.

According to the Denver Post, the bill has already passed in the state Senate and will get a final state House vote on Thursday. It's expected that Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, would sign the measure.\n\nIf passed, Colorado would join 11 other states and the District of Columbia that have already enacted the National Popular Vote interstate compact into law. Collectively, the states that have signed on control 172 electoral votes. The measure would not take effect until enacted by enough states to secure another 98 electoral votes -- for a total of 270, the number needed to win the presidency.\n\nUnder the compact, the national popular vote winner would be the candidate who received the most popular votes from all 50 states and the District of Columbia on Election Day. When the Electoral College meets in mid-December, the national popular-vote winner would receive all of the electoral votes of the states that enacted the popular vote measure.\n\nState Rep. Lori Saine, a Republican, told CBS News before Thursday's vote that while she expected the bill to pass the state House along party lines, she doubts the bill will have an impact on the 2020 election.\n\n\"President Trump said during the 2016 campaign that he's going to win no matter what...that he'd just campaign differently and I believe him,\" said Saine. She said the idea of \"converting electors to agents of other states would be a breach of public trust.\"\n\nSaine predicted intra-state lawsuits would be filed calling into question the state's rules on how they conduct elections. She added that the states that have already joined the compact are considered \"deep, deep blue. We'd be the only purple state there.\"\n\nAsked if there were any efforts planned by the Republican caucus to block the bill should it reach Polis' desk, Saine said she couldn't say, but she anticipated protests in the state.\n\nHow the Electoral College works now\n\nUnder the Electoral College, each state is allocated a number of votes equal to the number of senators and representatives in its U.S. congressional delegation\u2014two votes for its senators in the Senate plus a number of votes equal to the number of its members in the U.

However, it's unclear if the summit will include any press conference, like Mr. Trump's Singapore summit did. Officials said further details will be released later.\n\nThe overriding goal is \"ultimately about the denuclearization of North Korea,\" an official said. Mr. Trump is also focused on the possibility of prosperity for North Korea in the future.\n\n\"The president is very much focused on a picture of what success looks like,\" one senior administration official said of North Korea's future.\n\nMr. Trump has tweeted similar sentiments, while alluding to his 2017 comments calling Kim \"little rocket man.\"\n\n\"North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse,\" the president tweeted earlier this month. \"He may surprise some but he won't surprise me, because I have gotten to know him & fully understand how capable he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket - an Economic one!\"\n\nU.S. and North Korean delegations have met multiple times since last year's summit, although the Trump administration has struggled to defend what changes North Korea has made since.

But the release of her third album \"Scenery\" has earned her special praise from some of the biggest names in music, including John Legend, Sam Smith, Sara Bareilles and Justin Timberlake.\n\nIt makes sense that the singer-songwriter has music in her blood. Her parents Marion Cowings and Kim Kalesti are both jazz singers and she grew up watching them perform.\n\n\"I think it was always just put in my spirit,\" King said of singing. \"I don't think I was very good as a child. I was not a prodigy or anything. I think I just kind of forced the issue. I was in the bathroom trying to do Mariah, just you know at the top of my lungs as a kid.\"\n\nAt 15, she tried her hand at writing songs.\n\nSaturday Sessions: Emily King performs \"Look At Me Now\"\n\n\"I discovered the Beatles around that age and that was when I was like, 'Okay, songs. I'm a song person. That is what I love. Even more than albums, I love songs. How do people come up with songs? Can I be the person that writes a song? Let me try it,\" she told CBS News' Anthony Mason.\n\nKing said her mom helped her get her first gig at New York's The Bitter End. She did \"terrible\" but got applause thanks to an audience stacked with her friends.\n\nBut by 2004, at just 19, she was signed to Clive Davis' J Records. Her 2007 debut album, \"East Side Story,\" was nominated for a Grammy but a year later she was dropped by her label.\n\n\"You can't fool yourself. I've tried, and it just doesn't work. So I think that's what I took from that situation is, like, just go with your instincts, especially creatively,\" King said.\n\nKing has evolved into an acclaimed songwriter, winning the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Holly Prize in 2012, which honors \"exceptionally talented and inspired young musicians.\" But King still doesn't know exactly how she comes up with them.\n\n\"There is a magic to it. I think part of it is being open to whatever is going to come to you and showing up for the job and saying, 'okay I'm here,\" she said.\n\n\n\nFor King, it usually starts with a melody.\n\n\"Sometimes the words will come out, you know, as a mumble \u2026 like 'Can't Hold Me' is a song on my record that I had mumbled \u2026 I thought that sounds good. But maybe I should try something else.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/saturday-sessions-emily-king-performs-look-at-me-now/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/saturday-sessions-emily-king-performs-go-back/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/saturday-sessions-emily-king-performs-cant-hold-me/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spike-lee-on-blackkklansman-awards-and-an-artists-validation/", "text": "Imagine Spike Lee's pleasure last month, when he and his latest film, \"BlacKkKlansman,\" got six Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture. Actually you don't have to imagine it ...\n\n\"We all got up early to watch it,\" he told correspondent Leslsey Stahl. \"And so my son, Jackson \u2013 we didn't even know he's doin' it \u2013 videotaped on his iPhone. Now, what you see was everybody jumpin' down for Best Picture. We're all jumpin' down!\"\n\nAfter 40 years of directing nearly a film a year, this is Lee's first nomination for Best Director and Best Picture.\n\nIt's a sore point going back decades, when 1989 film \"Do the Right Thing,\" a comedy that turned dark about a single block in Brooklyn on the hottest day of the summer, was overlooked for a Best Picture nomination.\n\n\"A lot of people said you were robbed,\" Stahl said. \"Did it hurt?\"\n\n\"Oh, it hurt,\" he replied. \"And the reason why it hurt is, had they chose a great, great film for Best Picture, I'd have been cool with it. But their choice [\"Driving Miss Daisy\"] hurt like a mother*****r! It did!\n\n\"After 'Do the Right Thing,' and it was solidified with 'Malcolm X' [being snubbed], I was never going to be put in a position myself where I needed someone's \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 to validate my work, to give it value. I know what I do, and the people let me know. People tell me I've changed their life, how they never thought about going to college before they saw 'School Daze,' how they never even thought that black people can make movies.\"\n\n\"Isn't it ironic (I think it is) that now that 'BlacKkKlansman' has been nominated, you're up against 'Green Book,' which is kind of a reverse 'Driving Miss Daisy' \u2014 a white man driving a black man? Isn't that funny, or strange?\"\n\n\"Well, I had a talk with my wife, and we're not speaking about anybody, no other films. Particularly that one!\"\n\n\"If it wins, you're not gonna say a word?\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't say that!\" Lee laughed, loudly. \"Let's not take it too far!\"\n\nThe pitch to Lee for the movie \"BlacKkKlansman\"? \"Six words: 'Black man infiltrates Ku Klux Klan,'\" he said. \"That was it. The greatest ever. Six words!\"\n\nBut it's a true story. In 1978 Ron Stallworth, an African American undercover police officer in Colorado Springs, Colo., infiltrated the Klan, and was even assigned by the police to serve as a bodyguard for the Klan's Grand Wizard David Duke.\n\nStallworth later wrote the book that inspired the movie.\n\nHow did he get away with it? \"With a little bit of luck,\" he told Stahl, \"with a lot of skill, and with the participants that we were investigating being as dumb as they come! Dumb and Dumber and Dumbest!\"\n\nFocus Features\n\n\"To persuade the Klan of your authenticity, you said some vile things over the phone,\" said Stahl.\n\n\"I used their language, the language of hate,\" said Stallworth.\n\nLike what? \"When they asked me why I wanted to join, I said, 'I hate N*****s, Spics, Chinks, Jews, Japs, and anybody else that isn't pure Aryan White like I am, like we are,'\" Stallworth said.\n\nIn the movie as in real life, Stallworth answered a Klan recruiting ad. When he was invited to join, there had to be two Rons \u2014 Black Ron, on the phone, and White Ron, played by Oscar-nominee Adam Driver, who would go to Klan gatherings.\n\nThe real Ron showed us his Klan membership card that he keeps in his wallet, signed by David Duke.\n\nLast summer when the movie came out, Stallworth got a surprising phone call from someone he hadn't talked to in 40 years: Duke himself. \"He had issues with how he was being portrayed, and he wanted to discuss that with me. I guess he thought I was gonna go to Spike and appeal to Spike to tone it down a little bit!\" Stallworth laughed. \"That's the only thing I can think of. That's why he called.\"\n\nStallworth's wife, Patsy recorded the call on her phone:\n\nDAVID DUKE: \"I don't have the same recollection as you did on the some of the terms because I've always prided myself, in fact, all my Klan people always talked about how that I don't use the N-word. But I'm not saying I've never used it in context, obviously.\"\n\nLee was called the N-word many times, when his family became the first blacks to move into Cobble Hill, then an Italian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn. Among the acts of racism he experienced: being told he could not join the local Boy Scout troop. \"They said I couldn't do it 'cause I wasn't Catholic!\" Lee laughed. \"Well, we all knew what it was. My father told me what it was. So after that, I said, 'Eff the Boy Scouts. I don't wanna be in them.'\"\n\nHis father, a jazz musician who wrote the scores for most of Lee's early films, taught him another lesson: An anti-drug policy. For instance, he's never had a joint himself. \"It's well publicized my father had an addiction. So just seeing that, he's a jazz musician of that era. That era, jazz musicians, you know, they were doing stuff. And so that, uh-uh.\"\n\nHis mother, who died when he was away at Morehouse College, was an English teacher. \"My freshman year, I was very lonely. I was homesick. And I was writing my mother every week. And every week, my mother returned those letters that I wrote, and looked like she had cut her wrist on the paper. It was all marked up in red! And she used to tell me, 'I can't believe I have a son that goes to Morehouse that's semi-literate!'\"\n\nTwenty-five years ago, with all the money he'd already made on his movies, the semi-literate (just now nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay for \"BlacKkKlansman\") bought the building in Brooklyn that is now the headquarters of his production company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks. It's where he cuts most of his movies with his editor Barry Alexander Brown.\n\nIt's also where Lee keeps all the stuff he's collected over the years, including shots of him spouting off at Knicks games in a way that's earned him his reputation as an Angry Black Man.\n\nAnd there are reminders of his career as a maker of, and actor in, his famous commercials for Nike Air Jordans.\n\nThere's just one thing missing in all the clutter in his office: An Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Richard Buddenhagen.\n\nWEB EXTRA: One of the great movie title sequences: Rosie Perez dancing to Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" in \"Do the Right Thing,\" with cinematography by Ernest Dickerson:"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/emma-stone-and-rachel-weisz-call-the-favourite-a-high-stakes-mean-girls/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/after-50-years-sam-elliott-has-his-moment/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-oscars-2019-from-black-klansman-to-roma-2019-oscar-nominations-filled-with-historic-firsts/", "text": "The nominations for the 2019 Academy Awards were filled with historic firsts and recognition of diverse films.

The first was Salma Hayek for the film \"Frida\" in 2003.\n\nOnly a handful of women of color have been nominated for best actress. Halle Berry famously became the first black woman to win a best actress award in 2002. She remains the only black woman to receive the honor. That same year, Denzel Washington became the second black man to win an Oscar for best actor.\n\nAnother nominee from \"Roma\" is Mexican actress Marina de Tavira, who is up for best supporting actress. Also in that category, Regina King, who is black, received her first Oscar nomination for her performance in \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\"\n\nFor best actor, Rami Malek, who is Egyptian-American, was nominated for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" Mahershala Ali, who is black, was nominated for best supporting actor for his performance in \"Green Book.\"\n\nFirst best picture nomination for a streaming service\n\nNetflix's \"Roma\" made history as the streaming service's first film to receive a best picture nomination. Director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n was also nominated for best director, best original screenplay and best cinematography.

Lee has directed 30 feature films and has been nominated for best original screenplay and best documentary feature, but did not win. He has one honorary Academy Award and may take home his first best director award for \"BlacKkKlansman.\"\n\nOnly five other black men have been nominated for best director. In 2016, \"Moonlight\" famously won best picture after an on-stage mix-up with \"La La Land,\" but Barry Jenkins did not win for best director. In 2014, \"12 Years A Slave\" director Steve McQueen took home the award for best picture, but not best director.\n\nLee has a chance to take home the trophy for best director, best picture and best adapted screenplay for \"BlacKkKlansman,\" which was nominated in three other categories. Lee famously boycotted the Oscars in 2016, joining Jada Pinkett Smith and the #OscarsSoWhite protest.\n\nSpike Lee attends the photocall for \"BlacKkKlansman\" during the 71st annual Cannes Film Festival at Palais des Festivals on May 15, 2018 in Cannes, France.

The film is nominated for best picture \u2013 a first for a superhero film.\n\nIt also scored a nomination for best original song \u2013 \"All the Stars\" performed by Kendrick Lamar and SZA \u2013 and a nomination for best original score. The diverse cast, however, was snubbed in the acting categories. Some feel the film's star, Michael B.

Those two aside, this year's top awards are dominated by women.\n\nAfter backlash over the lack of female nominees last year, 2019 sees mostly young women in the best new artist category and five women competing with three men for album of the year.\n\nDespite an expanded field of nominees in the top categories this year, there were some notable snubs. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z \u2014 typically a favorite of the academy \u2014 didn't get any love in the main categories for their collaborative album, \"Everything Is Love.\" Kanye West, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande were all shut out of the major categories as well.\n\nShawn Mendes, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Alessia Cara and Apple Music's Zane Lowe joined \"CBS This Morning\" to announce the nominees for some of the biggest awards Friday morning. Mendes and Mon\u00e1e walked away with their own nominations while Cara, a four-time Grammy nominee and last year's best new artist, was not eligible.\n\nA tearful Mon\u00e1e dedicated her album \"Dirty Computer,\" which was nominated for album of the year, to all the \"marginalized voices\" or \"dirty computers\" who may not feel heard. She is now an eight-time Grammy nominee.\n\n\"This album is so much bigger than me. You know, it's not \u2014 I'm sorry. It's not about me, it's about a community of dirty computers, of marginalized voices. Being a young, black, queer woman in America, there was something I had to say and there was a group of people that I wanted to celebrate. And I just \u2014 I'm happy to be representing them. I hope they feel seen, I hope they feel heard and I hope they feel loved,\" Mon\u00e1e said.\n\nMendes earned his very first nominations Friday with nods in two major categories, song of the year and best pop vocal album. Asked what it means to him to write his own music, Mendes said \"everything.\"\n\n\"I think that it kind of brings you to another kind of level of connection with the music and then when you're recognized it means that much more. And when you perform live it means that much more,\" he said.\n\nThe 61st Annual Grammy Awards are set to air live from the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday, Feb. 10, marking the show's return to the West Coast.

Last summer's smash, \"Bodak Yellow\", catapulted her to the top of the billboard charts, and she became the first female rapper to have three Billboard #1 singles. But while her music has attracted attention, it's the Bronx native's personality that people can't seem to get enough of.\n\n\"You just gotta be yourself,\" she told correspondent Maurice DuBois. \"When I talk, I make a lot of mistakes. Like, I might say words, and the words are not even in the dictionary! But people still like it, because you can tell that I'm saying it from the heart.\"\n\nEven if you haven't heard her music, chances are you've heard her name. Cardi B is a pop culture phenomenon. Last summer's smash, \"Bodak Yellow,\" catapulted her from virtual unknown to the top of the Billboard charts.\n\n\"It hit at 85,\" she told correspondent Maurice DuBois. \"And I just felt like, 'All right, I already did enough.' And then when people was telling me, like, 'There's a possibility of going #1,' I was like, 'Oh, my gosh, if I go number one, this is going to be crazy!'\"\n\nAnd then it did. \"I just felt like I was on the top of the world,\" she said.\n\nThe 26-year-old rapper is still on top, with hit after hit, including \"I Like It\":\n\nAnd \"Girls Like You,\" a collaboration with Maroon 5:\n\nShe became the first female rapper to have three Billboard #1 singles, and on Friday she was nominated for five Grammy Awards.\n\nBut her personality that people can't seem to get enough of. \"I feel like people feel like I'm very reachable,\" Cardi said. \"When I talk, I make a lot of mistakes. Like, I might say words, and the words are not even in the dictionary! But people still like it. Because you can tell that I'm saying it from the heart.\"\n\nThe Bronx, New York native has been speaking from the heart for as far back as she can remember. Born Belcalis Almanzar, her nickname was Bacardi. She later shortened it to Cardi B.\n\nAtlantic Records\n\nGrowing up, her bad-girl behavior, including joining a gang, took a toll on her family. \"When I was, like, 17, practically almost turning 18 and everything, I got kicked outta my house. I was, like, a very rebellious teenager,\" she said.\n\nTo make ends meet, she found work at a grocery store, the Amish Market in Tribeca, but said she got fired for being chronically late. The manager suggested (brace yourself) she try out at a nearby strip club. \"I went the next day, and I got hired at the spot,\" she said. \"And literally in five hours I made my whole check or a little bit more.\"\n\nUsing the alias Camilla, Cardi spent a lot of her time at the Satin Dolls strip club in Manhattan. She showed DuBois her locker at the time, number 10.\n\n\"What'd you have in there?\" asked DuBois.\n\n\"Just my stripper shoes,\" she replied.\n\nWith few career prospects, she made the best of her situation. She acknowledges that stripping isn't a conventional calling, but it worked for her.\n\n\"A lot of the women here they taught me to be more powerful,\" she said. \"I did gain, like, a passion and love to performing. It made me feel pretty.\"\n\n\"Did that make you feel powerful?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm glad for this chapter in my life. A lot of people always want to make fun of me, like, 'Oh, you used to be a stripper.' I don't ever regret it. I don't ever regret it.\"\n\nCardi B with Maurice DuBois at the Satin Dolls strip club in Manhattan. CBS News\n\nWhy not? \"Because I learned a lot. And I feel like it matured me. My biggest ambition was money. Because that's what these women put in my head: 'Nothing is important but the money.'\"\n\nShe used that money (she says $200,000) to finance her music dreams. She put out mix tapes, and appeared on the reality show \"Love and Hip Hop.\" She gained some notoriety; but it was her social media savvy that put her on the map, going from 5,000 followers, to 36 million and counting on Instagram. Last year Time magazine named her one of its 100 Most Influential People.\n\nBut along with the fame, comes criticism and internet trolls. \"When I was, like, a nothing, everybody was rooting. And now that I'm finally here, people have a problem for it. Like, I feel like I work so hard, why do people feel like I don't deserve it?\"\n\nDuBois asked, \"Do you ever try to say, 'Snap out of it. Just forget about it. Just ignore it'?\"\n\n\"I do snap out of it. And I do ignore it. It's just like, it drives you insane!\"\n\nThe other part of fame that drives her crazy, she says, is the constant need to defend herself. This fall, her feud with another top female rapper, Nicki Minaj, resulted in a confrontation at a New York Fashion Week party.\n\nDuBois asked, \"Is it embarrassing to be involved in that kind of stuff?\"\n\n\"It's unnecessary. But am I ever embarrassed about anything that I do? No,\" she said.\n\n\"Is it good for business or bad for business?\"\n\n\"I think it's bad for business,\" Cardi replied. \"You know, a lotta people like to say, 'All publicity is good publicity.' To me, it's not. Because that takes away of people paying attention to your craft. It makes people not even care about your craft. They just want to see drama.\"\n\nAnd the drama continues. In true Cardi fashion, she took to Instagram last week to announce her split from her husband, the rapper Offset. The couple has a daughter together.\n\nBut fame does come with an upside. When Cardi and DuBois paid a surprise visit to her old high school, she was welcomed as royalty, and thanked her favorite teacher: \"I know that she's strict, but every single day until this day of my life, Ms. Hill was always in my head,\" she said.\n\nCardi B visits her alma mater, Renaissance High School for Musical Theater and the Arts, in the Bronx, N.Y. CBS News\n\nIt's been an extraordinary year for the woman who keeps beating the odds. But Cardi B says she remains determined \u2013 and hungry for more.\n\nShe said, \"People just feel like it's a, 'Ha-ha. It's almost over for you.' And it's just like, 'I get up every single time, honey.' And even before this fame stuff, I always get up, all the time.\"\n\n\"People can relate to that,\" DuBois said.\n\n\"It's like, you know, 'I've been down nine times, but I get up ten.'

I show it.\"\n\nTo hear Cardi B peform \"Money,\" from her album \"Invasion of Privacy,\" click on the video player below.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Robbyn McFadden."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/her-grammy-nominee-on-finding-purpose-seeing-her-vision-come-to-life/", "text": "She simply goes by the name H.E.R., and at 21 years old, the R&B singer-songwriter is up for five Grammy Awards including best new artist and album of the year.\n\n\n\n\"I don't really have the words for it.

[An earlier version of this story was originally broadcast on November 27, 2016.]\n\nOn a warm day last fall in New York\u2019s Central Park, Lady Gaga came to Strawberry Fields to pay her respects to John Lennon. \u201cI used to come here probably four times a week to John\u2019s memorial,\u201d she told Cowan.\n\nIt was an unannounced visit, and yet it became an event. Everything around Lady Gaga becomes an event.\n\nBut by Gaga standards, it was all pretty tame.\n\nLady Gaga, with correspondent Lee Cowan, in New York\u2019s Central Park. CBS News\n\n\u201cIt seems like you\u2019re more Lady now than Gaga, if that makes any sense,\u201d Cowan said. \u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Today,\u201d she laughed. \u201cWhat about tomorrow?\u201d\n\nThere was a time when the one thing you could count on from the theatrical pop diva was outrageousness. After all, she put \u201cmeat dress\u201d in the fashion dictionary. She wasn\u2019t style over substance, though; her six Grammys are proof of that. It was just part of the package.\n\nBut her latest solo album -- her fifth, called \u201cJoanne\u201d -- was a toned-down diva.\n\nShe said, \u201cI think that when people see me with less makeup on and less of what I was doing before \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense you\u2019ve evolved into something else?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. Oh, it\u2019s less now. But you know, I don\u2019t know that you can put a label on growth, you know? I\u2019m just me. I\u2019m just growing up. I\u2019m 30, you know; this is what I want to do now.\u201d\n\nThe title track, \u201cJoanne,\u201d written with producer Mark Ronson, is about her father\u2019s sister, Joanne Germanotta, who died of lupus at age 19, before Gaga was born. Gaga\u2019s middle name is Joanne \u2026 and it\u2019s also the name of her parents\u2019 Italian restaurant on New York\u2019s Upper West Side, where she and Cowan met.\n\n\u201cPlaying the music for my father for the first time was very powerful, and my grandma, too,\u201d Gaga said.\n\nHow did they react? \u201cIt was interesting: My father was very, very emotional. And my grandmother was, too, but she held my hand and she said, \u2018I hope, my dear, that you won\u2019t be too maudlin while you\u2019re putting this music into the world.\u2019 What I think she meant by maudlin -- it\u2019s an old word -- she didn\u2019t want me to have an obsession with the death of my aunt.\u201d\n\nShe calls \u201cJoanne\u201d her most honest record yet, including a song called \u201cMillion Reasons,\u201d about the heartache of relationships.\n\nGaga\u2019s own engagement to actor Taylor Kinney ended last year after five years together.\n\n\u201cI think women love very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cWe love men. We just love with everything we have. And sometimes I don\u2019t know that that love is met with the type of dignity that we wish it would be met with. You know, we\u2019re not trying to make you less of a man. We just want you to love us as deeply and as wholesomely and as fully as we love you.\u201d\n\nCowan said, \u201cWhen you were promoting your last album, you wore the world\u2019s first flying dress ...\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to laugh!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this time, it\u2019s dive bars is how you\u2019re sort of releasing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s just something fantastic and wonderful and humbling about being in a dive bar where I started making music and being able to sing this music.\n\n\u201cUp close and personal to the fans, looking them in the eye for the first time when they hear it, it reminds me that if this were all to go away tomorrow, all the big success, that I would still be very happy going from bar to bar, playing music for people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you really?\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cYes. The reason that I\u2019m here at all is because of my relationship with my family and their encouragement of me to be a musician and to work hard. So as long as I stay there, in that space, I can do anything -- that\u2019s my truth.\u201d\n\nStaying in that space wasn\u2019t always easy. Her debut album, \u201cThe Fame,\u201d was a huge hit, but Gaga had trouble washing off the persona she had created -- even for her own parents. \u201cI used to come home and I think my mom used to watch me have a real hard time washing it off, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d keep the wigs on and keep the make-up on, and kept the outfits on. I was always trying -- I never wanted to let my fans down, I always wanted them to see me in my art form.\u201d\n\nThe only place Lady Gaga could be Stefani Germanotta was behind the closed doors of her own home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line, I\u2019m not free anymore,\u201d she told Cowan. \u201cAs soon as I go out into the world, I belong, in a way, to everyone else. It\u2019s legal to follow me. It\u2019s legal to stalk me at the beach. I can\u2019t call the police or ask them to leave. And I took a long hard look at that property line and I said, \u2018Well, you know, if I can\u2019t be free out there, I can be free in here (indicating her heart).\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what this album is? Getting to do whatever you want to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd not what people are expecting or imposing on you to do?\u201d\n\nLady Gaga apologized for starting to cry.\n\n\u201cIs it emotional because you feel just that weight on you all the time, that fame is just -- ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI miss, I miss people, sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI miss people.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust having normal conversations with people?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I miss people. I miss, you know, going anywhere and meeting a random person and saying \u2018Hi\u2019 and having a conversation about life. I love people.\u201d\n\nLady Gaga with corespondent Lee Cowan at Joanne Trattoria in New York City. CBS News\n\nThe one barrier fame didn\u2019t put up was between her and her family -- especially her father, Joe.\n\n\u201cMaking your dad happy is, especially for an Italian Catholic girl, I\u2019ll tell you, it feels really good,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel that today. You know, all the awards in the world, you can get into all the nightclubs, they\u2019ll send you the nicest clothes. Nothing better than walking into your dad\u2019s restaurant and seeing a smile on his face and knowing that your mom and dad and your sister are real proud of you. And that, you know, you haven\u2019t lost touch with who you are. That, for me, is real success.\u201d\n\nTonight, that success will take her to Houston and the Super Bowl halftime show, where she\u2019ll have more eyes and ears at one time than ever before.\n\nOn the huge stage she will play, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it since I was a little girl, oh yeah! I just know that I can put a fantastic show together that will speak to the football fans as well as my fans.\u201d\n\n... Fans she still makes time for, whether in a football stadium or on a walk in the park.\n\nAs she left, she saw a man with a bike, and hopped on. Only Lady Gaga would make an exit -- side-saddle -- in a pink dress and heels, and somehow make it seem normal.\n\n\u201cYou gotta love New York!\u201d she laughed.\n\n\n\nFor more info:"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-the-record-janelle-monae-dirty-computer/", "text": "Janelle Mon\u00e1e's performance in the 2016 film \"Hidden Figures\" earned rave reviews.

When drugs came, crack in particular, it ruined a lot of families,\" she said.\n\nMon\u00e1e's own father, Michael -- now sober -- was lost for most of Mon\u00e1e's childhood.\n\nHe told Dokouopil, \"If I'm the perfect father, then she might just be just regular. But since I was who I was, since I had the downfall that I had, it caused her to move forward and to say, 'I'm never gonna be like that.' So it worked out for the positive.\"\n\nDokoupil asked Mon\u00e1e, \"Do you think that's true?\"\n\n\"I think that my parents were examples,\" she said. \"Sometimes good examples, sometimes bad examples.\"\n\nJanelle Mon\u00e1e with her father, Michael.

She made something out of nothing.\"\n\nThat's why Mon\u00e1e decided early on to honor her roots through her style.\n\n\"I wanted black and white to be my uniform,\" she said. \"I wanted people, when they saw me in a tuxedo or in black and white, to remember that this is where I come from. I come from a mother and a father who were custodian workers.\"\n\nIt was Mon\u00e1e's mother, Janice, who first saw in her daughter echoes of greatness, from James Brown to Elvis: \"People say, 'Oh, your daughter's music is really, really different,' And I say, 'You know why it's different? She got 'em all wrapped in one ball!'\"\n\n\"I'm from the future,\" Mon\u00e1e explained to her. \"I'm futuristic!\"\n\nMon\u00e1e cleaned up at local talent contests.

All you talked about was New York, New York, New York. And you mean to tell me you're going to leave?'\"\n\nRather than face her family back home, Mon\u00e1e crashed with friends in Atlanta, and for the first time started writing and performing her own original songs. \"I had to make it work,\" she said.\n\n\"As hard as it was going to be, it was gonna be easier than going back home and feeling like, what, a failure?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"Feelin' like I failed, yeah. I did not want to go home for people to say, 'Man, you really let us down.'\"\n\nBut she was soon signed by hip hop mogul Sean Combs, and mentored by Prince, whose death, she says, left her at a loss and delayed her work on \"Dirty Computer.\" \"I could always call Prince, he was always there.

Shawn Mendes has cheerfully become one of the biggest names in pop music.\n\nAt just 20 years old, he's already a veteran of three world tours, and three hit studio albums. He's also the first artist in history to have four #1 adult pop hits before his 20th birthday.\n\nShawn Mendes performs at the Sziget Music Festival in Hungary. CBS News\n\nAnd as correspondent Tracy Smith saw when she met him in his Malibu studio, his success is even more astonishing when you find out he learned piano by watching videos online.\n\n\"It's amazing, though, that you can become so skilled without having real [lessons],\" said Smith.\n\n\"You shouldn't say 'so skilled.' I'm, like, a very average piano player. But yeah, some people become extremely good at piano off of YouTube,\" he said.\n\nTurns out he also taught himself to play a pretty mean guitar. But self-teaching has its limits. There are some things Mendes was just born with.\n\nHis story begins in Pickering, Ontario, just east of Toronto.\n\nHe said he loved it in Pickering growing up, \"and I still do.\"\n\nSinger Shawn Mendes with correspondent Tracy Smith. CBS News\n\nThe older of two children, Shawn grew up in a music-loving family, and a lot of that music came from him.\n\nSmith asked, \"Did you sing in the shower and stuff?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah. It didn't have to be in the shower, though. It was everywhere.\"\n\n\"And your parents would say \u2026?\"\n\n\"'Shut up!'\" he joked.\n\nYoung Shawn started imitating his favorite singers, and he'd make little videos of himself doing so. And in 2013, lightning struck when he started posting some of those little videos online.\n\nWatch Shawn Mendes' cover of OneRepublic's \"Counting Stars,\" posted in 2014:\n\nIt got him noticed by millions of viewers, and eventually by a record label.\n\nSmith asked, \"What do you think it was that clicked with people?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I have no idea,\" Mendes replied. \"I think I have a good ear for what people like to listen to and want to hear. And I guess the stars kind of aligned for me.\"\n\nIn the space of a few years, Mendes went from his bedroom in Pickering to the recording studio, to a worldwide tour, and to events like the Met Gala in New York City.\n\nHe also won a spot on Time Magazine's list of the Most Influential People of 2018.\n\nShawn Mendes. CBS News\n\n\"Was there a part of you that thought, 'Wow, this is happening too fast'?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"Yeah, there was a moment when I thought things were going too fast, but then I realized that it's much better at going fast than slow in this world,\" he replied.\n\n\"You might as well just embrace it?\"\n\n\"You might as well, yeah!\"\n\nThe hard part of all this, he said, can be stopping long enough to smell the roses: \"Sometimes, like, I think in life we're so focused on the future and, like, where things are going to go, we forget to look at the beautiful parts of what we're living right now.\"\n\n\"Do you feel like you try to enjoy the present?\" Smith asked.\n\n\"Definitely. Every day I wake up and I'm, like, 'Dude, you're 20 and you're doing what you love to do for a living,' and I really have nothing truly to worry about at the moment in life.\"\n\n'Course he might worry about getting mobbed.

To check out our rundown of the most notable, memorable, heartwarming, humorous or ridiculously lame commercials from Super Bowl LIII, scroll through our gallery. Bon & Viv Spiked Seltzer: \"The Pitch\" Mermaid entrepreneurs with heads for business, and tail fins for navigating a real-life \"Shark Tank,\" star in this cute commercial for spiked seltzer that is kept afloat by good visual effects and sound design. Agency: Bullish. Pepsi: \"More than OK\" Not \"great\"? Not \"delicious\"? Just \"OK\"? Fine. Pepsi might be OK with selling its beverage as \"OK,\" repeatedly, but with such enthusiastic pitchmen and -women as Steve Carrell, Lil Jon and Cardi B, we almost believe that it's a greater compliment than it sounds. Carrell's buoyant energy carries the commercial and lifts it, like a shooting star. Agency: Goodby, Silverstein & Partners. Bubly: \"Michael Bubl\u00e9 vs Bubly\" Pepsi's sparking water, Bubly, has an almost-namesake for its brand spokesperson in singer Michael Bubl\u00e9 (eh, close enough). Points to the sound person who got the sharpie's squeaks just right, but if you're going to hire a singer for a commercial, could it have hurt you to have him sing? Agency: Goodby, Silverstein & Partners.\n\nSnacks M&Ms: \"Bad Passengers\" M&Ms candy, which had one of last year's worst ads (Danny De Vito as a human M&M demanding that people eat him), this year brings us a more palatable one, with Christina Applegate as a harried driver threatening her backseat passengers. Anyone with kids has been there, done that. Agency: BBDO New York. Doritos: \"Chance the Rapper x Backstreet Boys\" Of course, Doritos' Flamin' Hot Nacho flavor chips would be so hot they'd produce a fever dream for Chance the Rapper, resulting in Technicolor flop sweats and a dance-off with a '90s boy band. Not much happens of note, but we see some cool hot rods, and a hot jet, along with a remix of a song that will at the very least rack up some royalties for the songwriters of \"I Want It That Way.\" Agency: Goodby, Silverstein & Partners. Pringles: \"Sad Device\" It's a common theme in commercials tonight - robots or artificial intelligence undergoing existential crises because they lack the senses that humans have, like tasting beer or chips. And while we may not experience a Skynet apocalypse, we carbon-based units do have to confront what the sad robots' attitude portends. It must be said that the stars of this Pringles commercial do what many humans do when faced with an uncomfortable situation: Change the subject, and crank up Lipps Inc.'s \"Funkytown.\" Avocados From Mexico: \"Top Dog\" Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth plays the celebrity commentator at a dog show with a difference. Yeah, we might roll over and beg for guacamole, too, but that'd be as silly as this ad. Agency: Energy BBDO. Planters: \"Mr. Peanut is Always There in Crunch Time\" Mr. Peanut drives like a maniac, but for a higher purpose: saving baseball's Alex Rodriguez from having to ingest kale (!), because friends don't let friends eat kale. Charlie Sheen pops up, too, assuring us he is of more sober composure than the giant peanut pushing the pedal to the metal accompanied by the metal of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Planters has even announced a Twitter contest in which one lucky winner can be driven around by Mr. Peanut behind the wheel in the Nutmobile. Uhm, after seeing him drive here, we'll take a pass. Agency: VaynerMedia.\n\nInternet Bumble: \"The Ball Is In Her Court\" \"Don't wait to be given power,\" is the message of this ad from Bumble, a dating and social networking app, promoting the idea that women can and should be willing to make the first move. And who better to spread that message than Serena Williams, who stars in her own life story as an example of a woman whose pursuits made her a champion on the court. \"If I'd waited to be invited in, I never would have stood out,\" she says. And for everyone who makes a first move on Monday (Bumble has declared February 4th \"First Move Day\"), donations will be made to the charity Yetunde Price Resource Center. Agencies: FlyteVu and VMLY&R. Google: \"100 Hundred Billion Words\" A touching commercial that is ostensibly about the use of technology to translate language, both spoken and visual, to better understand their meanings, but which is really about the purpose of communication: to unite and to share.\n\nAutomotive Hyundai: \"The Elevator\" Jason Bateman (\"Ozark\") plays an elevator operator helping passengers get to their destinations, no matter how grueling or off-putting. Luckily, one couple uses Hyundai's Shoppers Assurance, and so get off on the right floor. Hilarious, and time to dig into that beet loaf! Agency: Innocean USA. Audi: \"Cashew\" Audi brought terrific commercials to the Super Bowl in 2016 (\"Commander\") and 2017 (\"Daughter\"), but sat out last year's game. Now they're back touting their electric vehicles with a very winning take on what it means to have died and gone to heaven. Anyone hoping for a fun Super Bowl ad will have the same experience here, without requiring the Heimlich maneuver. Agency: Venables Bell & Partners. Mercedes-Benz: \"Say the Word\"\n\nMercedes Benz's 2019 A-Class listens to your commands. If only life were like that. Cameos by the singer Ludacris and Wile E. Coyote bring some fun to the proceedings. Agency: Merkley & Partners. Toyota Rav4: \"Toni\" An inspiring commercial featuring college free safety Antoinette \"Toni\" Harris, who aspires to break through gender barriers on the gridiron. She's certainly the first female football player to appear in a Super Bowl ad, and her confidence assures us she'll continue to shatter assumptions. Oh, she's also driving a boss hybrid car. Agency: Burrell Communications. Toyota Supra: \"Wizard\" Who doesn't like The Who's \"Tommy\"? Although its story of a \"deaf, dumb and blind kid\" isn't necessarily what you'd want to be reminded of while you're tearing through a pinball machine-like obstacle course behind the wheel of a turbocharged Toyota Supra sports car with 300+ horsepower and eight-speed automatic transmission. A claustrophobic commercial, when what you'd really want to see, and feel, is this baby tearing through the open road. Agency: Saatchi & Saatchi. Wather Tech: \"Scout\" Weather Tech ads have usually been meat-and-potatoes affairs - they make floor mats for your car, that's what they're about, and they make no bones about it. But now they've added animals to their commercials, promoting their Pet Comfort products. Welcome to warm and fuzzy Super Bowl ads, Weather Tech! Agency: Pinnacle.\n\nBeer Stella Artois: \"Change Up the Usual\" Change is good, even for movie and TV characters that we've grown comfortable with over the years. But can we accept change when we see Carrie Bradshaw from \"Sex and the City\" (Sarah Jessica Parker) and The Dude from \"The Big Lebowski\" (Jeff Bridges) turn down their beverages of choice for a Stella Artois? The slapstick is dumb, but it's reassuring to know that The Dude still abides. Agency: Mother New York. Bud Light: \"Special Delivery\" A clever way to underscore how your beer contains no corn syrup is to play up how your competitors' does, by ostensibly doing them a kind favor! Take that, Miller and Coors! Michelob Ultra: \"Robots\" How can you compete against robots that out-run, out-bike, and out-perform humans in just about every way? Well, there are some areas where a robot's AI is no match, like tasting and enjoying alcohol. No kidding, this is one of the saddest commercials we've seen. Agency: FCB Chicago. Michelob Ultra: \"The Pure Experience\" Selling organic light lager without falling back on the bombastic tropes of Super Bowl beer commercials is certainly a challenge. But when you take Zoe Kravitz, put her in Kauai with two microphones and virtually no ambient sound, no music, and a mere whisper of ad copy, all those tropes are pleasantly forgotten. Watch it in stereo - and Shhh! Stop crunching chips while it's on. Agency: FCB Chicago. Budweiser: \"Wind Never Felt Better\" Budweiser's Clydesdales make their traditional Super Bowl appearance in an ad touting Anheuser-Busch's use of renewable energy sources, a nice sentiment (backed by Bob Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\"), and we thank A-B for doing their part. But the ad is certainly less sentimental or emotionally gripping (OK, just downright dull) compared to their past commercials featuring Clydesdale ponies or lost puppies. And while the Dalmatian's flapping jowls and ears cutely make it look as if it's about to take off, the ad does not make us thirsty. Agency: David.\n\nFinancial Expensify: \"2 Chainz x Adam Scott\" Rapper 2 Chainz and actor Adam Scott star in the first TV spot by the receipt-tracking app. Chances are, if you saw the 3:51 music video version released online, you would have thought this but a crude interruption. Agency: JohnXHannes New York. TurboTax: \"RoboChild\" Geez, what heartless people, to insult little RoboChild by telling him he doesn't measure up, emotionally, to a human TurboTax tax specialist! When the Skynet apocalypse comes, our new Robot Overlords will point to this as an example of how we had it coming.\n\nTravel Turkish Airlines: \"The Journey\" OK, our ears perked up when we heard that Sir Ridley Scott (\"Alien,\" \"Blade Runner\") directed a six-minute commercial for Turkish Airlines, shot in Istanbul, and starring Sylvia Hoeks (\"The Girl in the Spider's Web\"). A 30-second version is what was shown during the Game (would you pay for six minutes of Super Bowl airtime, which runs about $5 million per 30 seconds?), so it's frankly a teaser of a much more sumptuous film. There is no story per se, at least not one worth figuring out, but when there are drone shots over the Blue Mosque, you don't much care. Norwegian Cruise Lines: \"Good to Be Free\" \"Free\" is the operative word in this ad for the travel company, not just about the free stuff you get when you buy a ticket, but freedom from the drudgery of a cruise - like stepping off the boat to actually walk on a beach, surf, or paddle a kayak. You're also free to do stuff you might not think you can do on a boat, like race go karts. Agency: BBDO Atlanta.\n\nPersonal Products Olay: \"Killer Skin\" Sarah Michelle Gellar, the scream queen of such films as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Scream 2\" and \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" stars in this well-shot ad which centers on the very last thing that young people chased by a maniac with a knife would care about: the condition of their skin (assuming it hasn't been punctured). The commercial could have worked just as well for smartphone security apps, too. Agency: Saatchi & Saatchi.\n\nHybrid Bud Light: \"Joust\" What a wonderful head fake: Just when we think we're watching yet another goof-ball Bud Light medieval era commercial set at a jousting tournament, it turns into a wonderfully brutal teaser for the final season of HBO's \"Game of Thrones.\" Give the people behind this ad a cold one! Agencies: Droga5 and Wieden + Kennedy New York.\n\nTrailer Park Several trailers aired during the broadcast, with a teaser for \"Avenger: Endgame\" airing before kickoff. But the trailers burst out of the gate in the first commercial break with Hulu's \"Handmaid's Tale.\" Hulu: \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (Season 3) Sure, it looks and sounds like a Reagan-era \"Morning in America\" Super Bowl ad, with gauzy photography and the narrator intoning the advances of women (\"More are working than ever before!\"), but it soon descends into the dystopian territory of the Margaret Atwood tale. Disney/Marvel: \"Captain Marvel\" Oh, snap! Footage of the new Marvel superhero adventure starring Brie Larson, set before \"Infinity War\" wiped out half of the actors on Disney's payroll.\n\nTelecom Mint Mobile: \"Chunky Style Milk\" It's expected for companies to diss their competitors in their ads, but to liken them to past-expiration-date dairy products is really pushing this advertising game, and our stomachs, to the extreme. Fun, and maybe especially appealing to phone users who are lactose intolerant. Agency: In-house/Ruffian. Sprint: \"Best of Both Worlds\" Robots may be cool, but they don't guarantee a cool commercial. Even if you throw a mermaid, a flying horse, and sports legend Bo Jackson into the mix, you still get a lame ad that doesn't make you want to check out Sprint's LTE Advanced Network. Agency: Droga5. T-Mobile: \"We'll Keep This Brief\" T-Mobile brought a few witty ads that spoke to one of modern life's travails: texting. The best one featured that dreaded, lengthy text message that would break many data plans just to scroll through. Verizon: \"The Coach Who Wouldn't Be Here\" NFL coach Anthony Lynn nearly died in a horrendous car accident, and credits the efforts of first responders with saving his life. Taking a pass on cute commercials, Verizon tells his story, allowing Lynn to express his gratitude to a group of first responders, who then reveal their true identities. The ad effectively puts a human face on a service: making sure telecommunication systems are up and running when they're most needed. Agency: McCann More stories of NFL stars who give thanks to first responders can be seen in a documentary on CBS Sports Monday, Feb. 4 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nTech Simplisafe: \"Fear is Everywhere\" A terrific and humorous distillation of modern-day life - an existence filled with terrible news, fear, dread, conspiracy theories, high-tech surveillance, and, natch, robots - that can be protected thanks to, ironically, a home security system that watches over you. Amazon: \"Not Everything Makes the Cut\" Last year's Amazon commercial was a cute example of how a corporation might try to clean up the public relations mess of a product fail after its Alexa virtual assistant lost its voice, only to have it be replaced by celebrities less attuned to providing personal services. This year's spot, while very funny, is decidedly more dystopian, as a series of epic fails by Alexa leads to celebrity customers (like Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker, and \"Broad City\"'s Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson) at their wit's end, and electric utilities across the United States going bonkers. Uhm, is this a warning, Amazon? And if so, can you please not put Alexa into dog collars, let alone the power grid? It's not much to ask. Agency: Lucky Generals. Microsoft: \"We All Win\" (Extended Version) Children with disabilities already face enough challenges having to adapt to a world that doesn't necessarily cater to their bodies. As we see and hear from a gaggle of young gamers, Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller is a welcome example of how technology can be adapted to suit their needs. Consider heart tugged. Agencies: McCann.\n\nFood Devour: \"Food Porn\" Debuting among this year's Super Bowl advertisers is Devour, Kraft Heinz's frozen food brand, which got eyebrows arched with its original ad chronicling a young wife's dismay over her husband's sneaking addiction to \"food porn.\" Devour's racy commercial was originally rejected by CBS because, come on, there are kids watching the game who don't need to see commercials about porn, food or otherwise. A 30-second version, toned down from R to PG, has made it to the broadcast, but Devour stirred a buzz by posting a titillating, 60-second version of the ad online. It only served to prove that shorter, and slyer, is funnier. Agency: David Miami. Burger King: \"Eat Like Andy\" Danish filmmaker Jorgen Leth filmed artist Andy Warhol eating a Burger King hamburger with Heinz ketchup for his 1982 movie, \"66 Scenes from America.\" And really, that's all you need for a Super Bowl ad.

For others, it wasn't such a \"Sweet Victory.\" The beloved cartoon's creator, Stephen Hillenburg, died in November.\n\nMany of the show's viewers hoped he would be honored at this year's Super Bowl halftime show in Atlanta, headlined by Maroon 5, with a rendition of the song \"Sweet Victory.\"\n\nThe song originated in a 2001 episode of the Nickelodeon hit titled \"Band Geeks,\" during which SpongeBob and other characters perform at \"The Bubble Bowl,\" a football game that imitates the Super Bowl. The episode, and song, quickly became an iconic part of the show and is a favorite among many fans.\n\nThe song was so beloved that a Change.org petition titled, \"Have 'Sweet Victory' Performed at the Super Bowl\" garnered over 1,200,000 signatures. The aim was to honor both the show's creator and the tune itself.\n\n\"As a tribute to his legacy, his contributions to a generation of children, and to truly showcase the greatness of this song, we call for Sweet Victory to be performed at the Halftime Show,\" said the petition, started by user Isreal Colunga.\n\nThe moment from the show has also surged in popularity recently and become somewhat of a meme sensation since internet paired it with Travis Scott's hit \"Sicko Mode.\" Word came out that Scott and fellow rapper Big Boi would be joining Maroon 5 as guest performers -- driving fans to suspect that \"Sweet Victory\" could be making an appearance.\n\nMaroon 5 also fanned the flames of speculation when the band's official Twitter account posted a video tease of their Super Bowl performance last month. The clip included a second of SpongeBob footage. While it wasn't a clip from \"Sweet Victory,\" it was the only cartoon featured in the video, reports CBS Sports.\n\nThose who love the song got their wish \u2014 kind of. A short clip of the \"Sweet Victory\" performance featuring SpongeBob, Squidward and other characters was shown on the Mercedes-Benz stadium big screen as an introduction to Travis Scott's rendition of \"Sicko Mode.\"\n\nSome fans, and even the the cartoon's official Twitter account were happy to see the show and its creator seemingly honored. \"So honored and humbled!

Jackson, James McAvoy and Bruce Willis.\n\nIn a career that's also had some misses, it's another thriller \u2013 and part of the thrill this time is that he got to make it all.\n\nHe does not, however, call it a comeback. \"No. I'm happy that everybody is happy. I don't wanna put too much credence into that.\"\n\n\"Glass\" is the final installment in an unexpected trilogy nearly 20 years in the making. It all started with \"Unbreakable,\" back in 2000.\n\n\"Well, the plan, I'm guessing, was not to wait 18 years before you made the sequel!\" said correspondent Tony Dokoupil.\n\n\"'In 18 years I'm gonna make a trilogy!' No, when this came out and it had a kind of wonky reception, I felt hurt,\" he said.\n\nM. Night Shyamalan directing James McAvoy and Bruce Willis on the set of \"Glass.\" Universal Pictures\n\nIn the screening room at Shyamalan's house outside Philadelphia, he showed Dokoupil the script of \"Unbreakable,\" now the first in a three-part series about the rise of a comic book hero. Though now considered a cult classic, audiences were initially confused by \"Unbreakable.\" \"I felt like the reaction was like, 'Ah, what is this? This doesn't make any sense. Is it a comic book? What is this?'\" Shyamalan said. \"'It's not scary,' that was the main thing.\"\n\nSuccess had come scary-fast for Shyamalan, who was just 29 when \"The Sixth Sense\" came out.\n\nVisiting the location where that blockbuster was filmed brought back memories. He said, \"Basically making movies is just full of anxiety to me. Every time we come to a place where I've shot, it's just me feeling anxious, a younger version of myself standing here going, 'Are we gonna get this shot? Or not?' Or 'Does this look believable? Is anybody gonna see this movie?'\"\n\nM. Night Shyamalan with correspondent Tony Dokoupil outside the \"Sixth Sense\" house on Delancey Place in Philadelphia. CBS News\n\nThey did, and the film, with its much-talked-about twist ending [no, we're not giving it away], shot to the top of the box-office. It had young Haley Joel Osment offering one of the most quotable lines in movie history (\"I see dead people\"), and it catapulted a movie-crazed little boy from Philadelphia, the son of Indian immigrants, both doctors who thought their son's filmmaking was just phase, onto Hollywood's A-List.\n\n\"I see dead people.\" Haley Joel Osment in \"The Sixth Sense.\" GETTY IMAGES\n\nNewsweek's cover dubbed him \"The Next Spielberg.\"\n\nDoukoupil said, \"Most people don't get that at that age, to be called 'The Next Spielberg.'\"\n\n\"Yeah. I heard that they originally had the cover say 'The Next Hitchcock.' And they're like, 'Well, he's gonna get killed. So don't do that!' And then they switched it to Spielberg, as if that's not gonna kill you, either!\" he laughed.\n\nBut the young director soon felt boxed in by expectations, and a series of mid-career critical failures, like \"Lady in the Water,\" \"The Last Airbender\" and \"After Earth,\" seemed to damage the Shyamalan brand.\n\nHe said, \"When I look back on it, in terms of the relationship with the audience, I totally get the sense of detachment, that they want a certain drink, Coca-Cola, and I'm giving them tea.\"\n\n\"There were parts of the public that thought you'd become a joke,\" Dokoupil said.\n\n\"Maybe. I just don't know who doesn't do this journey. You're describing the journey of an artist. And every single artist does this, I mean, every single one. And I'm so grateful for that period, because it reminds me what it feels like to not be sure of myself.\"\n\n\"But did it feel like, in those middle years, that you were failing?\"\n\n\"It felt confusing,\" Shyamalan said. \"I was like, 'Wow, I'm wobbly,' in terms of, but that's not who I am. I am not a wobbly person.\"\n\nDirector M. Night Shyamalan on getting accepted into NYU film school\n\nSo, in 2015 the one-time Golden Boy of Hollywood, who gave himself the name Night just before entering film school, mortgaged his home to fund a dark new thriller, \"The Visit.\"\n\nDokoupil said, \"I can't imagine the pressure. Not only is your reputation on the line, but there's your own money and your home.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah, definitely. And think of it this way, I've made a huge income ever since I've been, like, 25 years old, that's been coming in every year, every year. And then I went, not only am I not getting paid, I'm going to pay for the movie. So we're going back in that direction really fast.\"\n\nBut \"The Visit\" was a return to form. And its success gave Shyamalan the freedom and the funds to finish off the comic book story he started so long ago.\n\nDirector M. Night Shyamalan's advice to his younger self\n\nNow at 48, Shyamalan, who never left for Hollywood and is a diehard Philadelphia 76ers fan, is at peace with the plot twists in his own life. \"That sense of gratitude keeps washing over me,\" he said. \"And it keeps you from thinking that this is permanent. It's not. That's what's so beautiful about it. It's not permament.\"\n\n\"The ending keeps changing?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"Yeah, it keeps constantly changing.\"\n\nAnd with \"Glass,\" he's betting once again that the best is still to come.\n\nDokoupil asked, \"So, don't call it a comeback? Forget it, it's not a comeback?\"\n\nShyamalan said, \"Whatever happens with 'Glass,' it's great. It's good. Failure, success, it's good.

That long, long staircase was the stage for one of Hollywood's funniest gags, imagined by one of its funniest duos, Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy.\n\n\"The Music Box\" won an Oscar in 1933, the first Academy Award ever given for a live-action short subject.\n\nHow not to deliver a piano: Laurel & Hardy, and a tall flight of stairs, in \"The Music Box\" (1932). MGM\n\n\"People ask me when did you become aware of Laurel & Hardy, and I'd say, 'Well, when did you become aware of salt and pepper?' They've just always been there,\" said actor John C. Reilly. He and Steve Coogan are huge Laurel & Hardy fans, but that made them more than a little nervous to portray their comic heroes in a new film, \"Stan & Ollie.\"\n\n\"I felt a little proprietorial about him in some ways,\" said Coogan. \"I feel like I'm not going to let anyone else get their dirty hands on this role, because I feel like, despite my anxiety about it, I wanted to have a go.\"\n\nThe film focuses on the team's later years, when they embarked on a stage tour of the U.K. back in 1953.\n\nReilly said, \"Some of the theaters where we shot this film, those were the theaters where they performed. So we're literally, like, channeling these guys in the places where they performed. It was a pretty heady experience I have to say. Being a fan of these guys, it was very special.\"\n\nTheir likeness to them is uncanny. Reilly, who's up for a Golden Globe for his performance, had to spend four hours every day in makeup just to achieve Hardy's 250-pound appearance.\n\nFor director Jon S. Baird, the challenge wasn't just their looks, but getting the laughs, too.\n\n\"I mean, it looks very effortless, it looks like they're just making it up as they go, but for that comedy timing to work, you have to be so on point,\" said Baird.\n\nLaurel & Hardy didn't invent slapstick, but they refined it. They made it charming, almost elegant, inspiring generations of comedians that followed.\n\nA little Old West soft shoe: Laurel & Hardy in \"Way Out West\" (1937).

He became friends with Laurel after he found him listed in the phone book and called him to ask for advice. \"When I talked to him on the phone, I said, 'Mr. Laurel, you know I've always admired you, and I'm afraid I've stolen from you.' And he said, 'Yes, I know!'\"\n\nAlthough he rarely got the credit, Laurel wrote nearly every routine for the pair \u2013 a good-natured workaholic whose gentleness shone through in his work.\n\n\"I was reading something recently that my great-grandfather had written, it was a letter from the studios and they wanted him to do something,\" said Cassidy Cook. \"He replied saying if you can't play it in Sunday school, I won't do it.\"\n\nYes, Cassidy is Stan Laurel's great-granddaughter. \"People say I look like him. I mean, if I told you how many people asked me to scrunch up my forehead and my chin, and I'll do it, because I get a kick out of it, too!\"\n\nCowan met her at the Pig and Whistle, an old L.A. haunt that still has that old Hollywood feel.\n\nEvery story she ever heard about her great-grandfather also included stories about Babe (Laurel's nickname for Hardy) as if the two weren't business partners, but family.\n\n\"He really loved Babe,\" said Cassidy. \"I mean, they were close. So few duos of that time actually liked each other, and they did.\"\n\nWhich is why, she says, they never stopped performing, even when ill health and old age started to get the better of them.\n\nHardy went first, in 1957, leaving Laurel inconsolable. In fact, he kept writing material for the both of them until the day he died, nearly eight years later.\n\nBaird said, \"He was so in love with Ollie, and Laurel & Hardy, that he couldn't give that up.\" He continued to write knowing that it would never get seen.\n\nIt's not just the new movie that has people talking about Laurel & Hardy again.

I could just see at that moment just how much deep, deep love there was in that relationship,\" Jones said.\n\nThe actress said Ginsburg was very involved from the beginning of the project, giving \"meticulous notes\" to ensure that the production accurately portrayed the law.

While Van Gogh has long been a subject of intense interest, having died at just 37 years old after suffering what is believed to be a series of psychotic episodes, this latest film starring Willem Dafoe seeks to make a point about life as an artist.\n\nFor Dafoe, painting was the key to getting inside the troubled artist's mind. The film focuses on the final few years of Van Gogh's life and features Dafoe painting in real time, a skill he had to learn for the role.\n\n\"It's about painting and it was important for me to paint in the movie, and that really became the key to unlocking a relationship to Van Gogh,\" Dafoe told \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nWith more than 100 credits to his name, Dafoe is known for his versatility. This latest role has earned him praise of the highest degree from critics \u2013 some of whom have called it the best work of his career \u2013 and from director Julian Schnabel, a celebrated painter himself, who said he can't picture anyone but Dafoe portraying Van Gogh.\n\nDafoe said of Schnabel, \"He taught me many things about painting, how to make marks, how to paint light. It really changed how I see, and that was essential. And that's really the heart of the movie, because if you can kind of get into how to look at Van Gogh's work, you can get in his head and that's the experience of the movie.\"\n\nInside the entirely hand-painted film about Vincent Van Gogh's life\n\nAsked by \"CBS This Morning\" co-host John Dickerson to describe what he sees at that moment, the Oscar-nominated actor effortlessly slipped into a description that seems only possible from someone with an artist's eye.\n\n\"Well, looking at you right now, initially I would have tried to paint a man there. But right now I'm looking at you, I see that white highlight here, I paint the light,\" he said. \"It's not just deconstruction, you start to see the origin of things, the rise and fall of things. And it really opens everything up and it's a new way of seeing. And really, for me, when you start to see that happen in the movie, and you do as you watch him paint.\"\n\nThough deeply troubled, Van Gogh's final years were his most productive, resulting in some of his best-known works produced at a pace of almost one per day.\n\n\"It appears from his -- from my view, it appears he was happiest when he was painting and he was very productive then. \u2026 I didn't think so much about the tortured aspect, I really concentrated on the painting. It was tortured in that it was hard to reconcile those ecstatic states with everyday life,\" Dafoe said. \"I think that he's deeply steeped in spiritual impulse -- that he was much more joyous than we often think.\"\n\n\"At Eternity's Gate,\" is distributed by CBS Films, a division of CBS."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/at-eternitys-gate-willem-dafoe-julian-schnabel-on-vincent-van-gogh/", "text": "At the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the actor and the artist come face-to-face, as Willem Dafoe studies a self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh. \"It's like a relic, I can't get over that.

CBS News\n\nAnd in a prolific stage and film career spanning 40 years, with parts ranging from soldiers (\"Platoon\") to super-villains (\"Spider-Man\"), Dafoe says nothing compares to this.\n\n\"I love this movie. It was a beautiful experience to make [it],\" he said.\n\n\"He changed you?\" asked correspondent Serena Altschul. \"How did Van Gogh change you? How did the film change you?\"\n\n\"It changes how I see, and not just painting, but how I see things in life.\"\n\nThat new perspective includes a different way to approach this almost-mythical figure. Unlike previous movies about the artist, \"At Eternity's Gate\" focuses on what he created, not the madness that consumed him.\n\n\"Yes, he had lots of challenges, no doubt about that,\" Dafoe said. \"But he was also productive. He was painting practically a painting a day. And you can tell from his letters how happy he was, his feeling of seeing something that's beautiful.\"\n\nWillem Dafoe in \"At Eternity's Gate.\" CBS Films\n\nAt 63, Dafoe is 26 years older than Van Gogh at the time of his death, but for director Julian Schnabel, he was destined for the role.\n\nAltschul asked, \"In your mind, it was Willem Dafoe?\"\n\n\"It was always gonna be Willem,\" Schnabel said. \"He became something else. I don't think it's a performance. He was the incarnation of something.\"\n\nDafoe did undergo a makeup test: \"He invited me over to the house, his place. And they put a beard on me and shot pictures. And I think he sat with those images for a little while. And then shortly after, he said, 'Let's do this thing.'\"\n\nIt seems only fitting that Schnabel, a filmmaker (\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\") and painter known for his outsized art, and personality, would take on this larger-than-life subject.\n\nHe said, \"I wanted to make a movie that wasn't about Van Gogh. I wanted the audience to feel what it was to be him.\"\n\nOscar Isaac (playing Paul Gaugin), director Julian Schnabel and Willem Dafoe during filming of \"At Eternity's Gate.\" CBS Films\n\nSchnabel has the fame and fortune that Van Gogh never had in life. But the 67-year-old, whose works have sold for millions, says the Dutch painter achieved something truly priceless. \"This thing in the film is, it kinda talks about, really, what success is,\" he said. \"I, for one, think that Van Gogh was successful because he achieved what he wanted to do. He is his paintings. And those paintings are still conversing with us. And I say that's a huge success.\"\n\nMuch of \"At Eternity's Gate\" was filmed on location in the South of France, with Dafoe retracing Van Gogh's footsteps, an experience he calls intense and enlightening. \"It's a good feeling when you look out at a landscape and it's almost recognizable,\" he said.\n\nAs for the still lifes, landscapes and portraits, Schnabel did most of them, but not all. Dafoe recreated Van Gogh's 1888 painting \"Shoes,\" with some advice from Schnabel. \"Julian coached me on painting the shoes,\" Dafoe said. \"This is why, even though when I'm painting I'm not painting necessarily in the style of Van Gogh, I'm painting. But there are things [in Van Gogh's brushstrokes] I recognize.\"\n\nVincent van Gogh (Willem Dafoe) painting a pair of shoes, in \"At Eternity's Gate.\" CBS Films\n\nThis is Schnabel's sixth film, but with his paintings hanging alongside works by 19th century masters at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, it's clear the canvas will always be his calling.\n\nAltschul asked if he would ever stop painting. \"No,\" he replied. \"I can't stop painting because if there's anything, the way I mediate the world is through painting. I mean, my way of living or reason to live is to do that.\"\n\nDafoe's performance has drawn raves, and he's been nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, a first for him.\n\nAltschul said, \"This is a moment for you. Do you think, 'I'm now being acknowledged for my work as a leading male'?\"\n\n\"It's nice, it's nice,\" he replied. \"And it feels comfortable, too. Is it a great role of a lifetime?

I've never had to tell someone that I was pregnant \u2013 because I'm not a woman \u2013 but it's not something you rush into.

I just took a trip to Europe and decided I'm going to adapt a James Baldwin novel, and then after the fact realized, 'Oh, in order to make this film I need the rights!'

So that's something I have in common with her.\"\n\nAdams said that most people feel unable to express their true feelings and share their darkest secrets, which is extremely difficult to do everyday.\n\n\"Camille wears her pain and sometimes it would be so freeing, wouldn't it, if everybody could just see the pain that everyone's wearing,\" she said.\n\nFlynn, also a co-executive producer of the series, praised Preaker's mental tenacity despite her struggles.\n\n\"To me, I think Camille is a very heroic character, because I think sometimes if you're in a lot of psychological pain and have been through a lot of psychological damage, the most heroic thing that you can do is keep your head above water,\" Flynn said. \"And that's what Camille does again and again, every single day.\"\n\nAdams added that her character's reconnection with her estranged mother made her think about her relationship with her own daughter, Aviana.\n\n\"I did think about like the way that generationally, we pass down our own dysfunction, intentionally or unintentionally,\" she said. \"So it made me look at how I parent and sort of what I need to own on my own in order to be a really good mom to her and what I need to let go of.\"\n\nFlynn said she hopes viewers find \"comfort\" in the series. She shared that of all the books she's written, people approach her about \"Sharp Objects\" the most.\n\n\"That's the one that people linger in bookstores or book events or that write to me about and want to share a story with me about,\" Flynn said. \"And so I think, again like I said, sometimes keeping your head above water is the heroic thing in any given day.\"\n\n\"Sharp Objects\" premieres Sunday, July 8, 2018 on HBO."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/atlanta-the-new-hollywood-of-the-south/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ben-stiller-directs-prison-break-miniseries-escape-at-dannemora-interview/", "text": "In June 2015, a pair of convicted killers vanished from their cells inside a maximum security prison in upstate New York. It seemed only a matter of time before their brazen escape, and the 23-day manhunt that followed, got its Hollywood close-up. What might surprise you is just who's behind that close-up.\n\n\"I was out of the country shooting 'Zoolander 2' when it happened, so I wasn't as familiar with it,\" said Ben Stiller, one of the funniest actors on the planet, the star of three separate billion-dollar comedy franchises (\"Night at the Museum,\" \"Madagascar,\" and \"Meet the Parents\") \u2013 not to mention favorites like \"There's Something About Mary,\" \"Tropic Thunder,\" and those \"Zoolander\" movies.\n\n\"So, this is what's confusing: It's sort of like, 'There was a big prison break. We should make this into a great drama. Let's get the 'Zoolander' guy to take a look at it!'\" said correspondent Tony Dokoupil.\n\nBen Stiller directing the prison break miniseries \"Escape at Dannemora.\" CBS News\n\n\"Yeah, some people might think that this could actually be funnier than 'Zoolander 2'!\" Stiller laughed. \"I don't blame them for that. Because I would probably think that, too, if I didn't know anything about what I was doing and they said, 'Oh, Ben Stiller's gonna do this?' 'cause they don't know what's going on in my head.\"\n\nAs it turns out, nothing was more serious than directing a real-life drama.\n\nThe result is \"Escape at Dannemora,\" a seven-part miniseries, debuting next Sunday on Showtime (a division of CBS). It stars Benicio Del Toro as Richard Matt, serving 25 years-to-life for the kidnap-murder of his former employer; and Paul Dano as David Sweat, also sentenced to life for murdering a sheriff's deputy.\n\nTo watch a trailer for \"Escape at Dannemora\" click on the video player below:\n\nDokoupil asked, \"How do you even get a hacksaw blade into prison?\"\n\n\"Well, that's why you sleep with the woman who runs the tailor shop!\" Stiller replied.\n\nThe key to their escape was help from a prison employee with a romantic appetite: Joyce Mitchell, played by Patricia Arquette. \"I think she's bored and she's looking to feel something,\" she said.\n\n\"What does Ben do to help you bring out this character?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"I wasn't sure how he was going to be as a director. But he's really generous with actors and gives you a lot of support and listens to your ideas, and really lets you try them out in a really authentic way.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough Stiller, at 52, has directed in the past, this marks the first time he's taken on directing exclusively. Asked how he felt about taking on the job, Stiller said, \"It was a personal revelation, directing and not acting. 'Cause you know, who wants to direct me, right? I don't!\"\n\nStiller says it was the nitty-gritty details of the story that hooked him, so much so that while filming on location last February, he made sure we saw the actual manhole cover where the two escapees emerged to freedom. \"I just kept coming back to the facts. Like, what really happened? And if there were something that seemed kind of almost unbelievable but it was true, that was something I wanted to try to include so that people would have that reaction, and go: Come on, that can't be true!\"\n\nBen Stiller and Tony Doupil at the manhole through which Richard Matt and David Sweat made their escape from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y.

They then cut their way into a steel pipe, and shimmied 15 feet to cut a second hole, to freedom.\n\nStiller shimmied through the pipe as well. \"Yeah, I mean, as a director, I felt like I had to!\"\n\nPerhaps that's because the son of comedy greats Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara didn't always dream of following the family into performing. \"In my mind I was always thinking, I want to be a director. I want to be a director.\"\n\nBen Stiller with Will Ferrell and Milla Jovovich in \"Zoolander.\" Paramount Pictures\n\n\"So the whole got-a-Super-8-camera-at-age-8-or-9, that's true?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. I mean, that was the only option back then!\" he laughed. \"Lots of fake blood. I remember making my sister throw up yogurt once in the elevator.\"\n\nBut after directing the 1996 movie \"The Cable Guy,\" Hollywood executives had a message for Ben Stiller, the director: \"The message being that, like, the phone not ringing!\" Stiller laughed. \"That being, there is no message. Checking your messages and there is no message. Yeah, 'Cable Guy' was not a hit!\"\n\nIn fact, the opening of the New York Times review of \"Cable Guy,\" which starred Jim Carrey as a devious cable technician, announced it as \"the true disaster movie of the summer.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I remember reading that [opening paragraph]. I don't know if I read the rest of it!\" Stiller laughed.\n\n\"I wouldn't have,\" Dokoupil offered.\n\nTwo years later, \"There's Something About Mary\" was a surprise hit, beginning actor Ben Stiller's career as a master of gross-out humor, humiliation and pain.\n\n\"Are there gags that you've looked at in the script and been like, 'I'm sorry. I'm just not doin' that'?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"Sure, yeah. Those are the ones you didn't see.\"\n\nStill, broad comedy has always co-existed with the more serious roles Stiller says he's proud of, but he now admits humor may have to take a backseat. \"I'm not really that interested in doing that kind of stuff,\" he said. \"That's just where I'm at in my life now.\"\n\n\"Are we seeing a kind of semi-retirement from comedy?\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Full-on retirement?\"\n\n\"It always goes well for actors, when they announce their retirement, doesn't it?\"\n\nEven so, \"Escape at Dannemora\" does sound more and more like an escape for Ben Stiller, too. \"That would be a great escape!\" he laughed. \"I would love it.\"\n\n\"You'd be happy with that?\"\n\n\"Yeah, for sure.

And it took me about 15 minutes of silence of just sort of walking around his body and touching different places his arms, his hands to just really let it sit in that I'm going to be forming a relationship with him for the next year of my life,\" Pitts said. \"And it was overwhelming because he is so magnificent.

They talked with our Tracy Smith:\n\nThe Go-Go's, the barrier-breaking 1980's hitmakers, have stood on a lot of stages. But never this one.\n\n\"That's your Broadway theatre!\" said \"Head Over Heels\" director Michael Mayer. \"Barbra was on this stage, too.\"\n\n\"Barbra who?\" asked Jane Wiedlin.\n\n\"Barbra Streisand, remember her?\" he laughed.\n\nWatch the full story here:\n\nThe Go-Go's: Breaking barriers\n\nThey're in Streisand territory because the Go-Go's phenomenon has come to Broadway. They don't actually appear in the new musical comedy, \"Head Over Heels,\" but some years ago, a Broadway producer thought it would be a great idea to artfully insert Go-Go's songs into an Elizabethan-era story about a royal family and a prophecy that could spell their doom.\n\nThis is not their life stories. \"Yes, thank you for clarifying that!\" laughed Kathy Valentine.\n\n\"We were not born in the 1580s!\" said Wiedlin and Belinda Carlisle.\n\n\"Even though, sometimes we might feel like it!\" quipped Charlotte Caffey.\n\nThey may feel that way because they've done the walk from dressing room to stage hundreds, maybe thousands of times.\n\n\"We're all really good at doing this \u2013 we are really, really good at being Go-Go's,\" Valentine said.\n\nOn-and-off for 40 years now, Valentine, Wiedlin, Caffey, Carlisle and Gina Schock get together to show why the Go-Go's have been called one of the most successful all-female bands in the history of rock 'n' roll.\n\nSmith asked, \"When you're up onstage looking out at the audience, what do you see?\"\n\n\"Grandparents, parents, kids,\" said Carlisle. \"It's thrilling, you know, that our music has that kind of appeal.\"\n\nThat's not the way it began in 1978, when Belinda Carlisle and Jane Wiedlin decided, somewhat naively, to form a group. \"We came from the punk rock scene in L.A., where anything went and you could learn as you went along,\" Carlisle said. \"And we had no idea how to play our instruments or do anything.\"\n\n\"We were absolutely rotten when we started,\" said Wiedlin.\n\nRough, maybe, but enough to attract other members who'd actually played music before \u2013 drummer Gina Shock (who missed our interview because of surgery), bassist Kathy Valentine, and guitarist Charlotte Caffey, who was trained in classical piano. \"So, I was in awe, I was a little scared of them. But it was kind of exciting! They were the cool girls that were punky. And I was kind of more, like, you know, reserved and straight. Kind of.\"\n\nHow the Go-Go's got their name\n\nIt's hard to imagine now, but in their early days, each band member made about $40 a week. And they had plenty of proverbial doors slammed in their faces. \"Every door,\" Wiedlin said.\n\nAccording to Carlisle record executives would not sign them \"because we were women, or girls. We were girls then!\"\n\nBut the \"girls\" did make it happen. \"We Got the Beat\" became the Go-Go's first hit in England and then in the United States. Like almost all of their music, it was written, arranged and performed by all women.\n\nSmith asked, \"What did that do to have it be all-female?\"\n\n\"I think it emboldened us,\" Wiedlin replied. \"I mean, especially the five of us, we've always said, like, we're this five-headed monster when we're together. It's this ball of energy that can be a force for good or a force for evil!\"\n\nTruth is, underneath all the fun and fizz was something a little more serious. You can hear it in \"Our Lips Are Sealed,\" upbeat but with lyrics that are a little dark:\n\nCan you hear them?\n\nThey talk about us\n\nTelling lies\n\nWell, that's no surprise. Can you see them?\n\nSee right through them\n\nThey have no shield\n\nNo secrets to reveal.\n\n\"That's kind of a Go-Go trademark that we always make an effort not to make something, like, 100% happy or 100% sad,\" said Wiedlin. \"We like to mix things together to keep things more interesting.\"\n\nCaffey added, \"That kind of dark against happiness, it's really, I love it.\"\n\nAnd the same goes for their 1982 hit, \"Vacation.\" The video seems happy-go-lucky, until you look a little closer.\n\nWiedlin recalled: \"That video, that was, like, a 14-hour shoot, and we were so bored and miserable that we all started drinking. \u2026 This part in the video where it looks like we're on the [water] skis and we were so drunk by then, if you, like, look at our eyes, we're all like \u2026!\"\n\nAnd while they all seemed chummy at a People magazine photo session a few weeks ago, the band's history hasn't been so happy-go-lucky, either: Medical problems, drug and alcohol abuse, and several knock-down, drag-out breakups.\n\nWiedlin said, \"Over the past, we always keep hurting each other and then keep forgiving each other and then healing and then trying to grow. And that's how I feel that we are all at this point.\"\n\nThink a group of sisters who can be extremely close, but at the same time, light years apart.\n\nValentine said, \"There's been times we're in the dressing room, throwing stuff at each other. I think somebody got hit once! There's a lot of conflicting energy. But somehow, out of all of that, something stays very intact and still works very well. There's always a little eye in the hurricane that stays really nice, you know? And special.\"\n\nThey do get along well enough to still play as a band. Recently, to the surprise of the audience, the Go-Go's performed onstage with the \"Head Over Heels\" cast.\n\nThe Go-Go's perform \"Our Lips Are Sealed\"\n\nWhile they can cross Broadway off their bucket list, the Go-Go's still have one more mountain to climb:\n\nSmith said, \"A lot of your fans think that there's a grave injustice that you guys are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\"\n\nWiedlin said, \"You can't take away the fact that we were the very first successful all-female band who wrote all their own songs and played all their own instruments.\"\n\nThe Go-Go's perform \"Head Over Heels\"\n\nHall of Fame honors of not, when you're a Go-Go, it just doesn't seem right to stop.\n\nIn 10 or 15 years time, they could be on stage together, and Valentine noted, \"All the record companies, will say, 'There's never been an all-granny band before'!\"\n\nWhich may be their ticket to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Jay Kernis."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/the-magic-of-harry-potter-returns-on-stage/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/the-hate-u-give-author-angie-thomas-talks-new-novel-on-the-come-up/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/travels-with-the-green-book-the-history-of-the-negro-motorist-green-book/", "text": "Watching Mary Wilson, feeling the love at New York's glamorous Caf\u00e9 Carlyle, it's hard to imagine what she felt at the age of 19 when, as a newly-minted Supreme just out of high school, she went on her first-ever road tour with a regular who's-who of Motown stars.

Taylor told the story of her stepfather's family being stopped and relying on a tried-and-true subterfuge for avoiding trouble: \"His dad worked for the railroad, had a good job. And his mother was sitting in the front seat. So, the sheriff comes to the door and says, you know, 'Who's this car? Where are you going? Who are these people with you?' And his father says, you know, 'This is my employer's car.' And he looked to his wife. And he said, 'And she's the maid. And this is her son.'\n\nA sign of the times in the era of Jim Crow.

And he said, 'It's hanging right in the back, officer.'\"\n\nEssentials for driving in and out of the Jim Crow South: A chauffeur's hat, and the Green Book. \"The 'Green Book' was like a Bible. You did not leave home without it,\" said Alice Clay Broadwater, who was a teacher traveling with her lawyer-husband and small children between Boston and the South. She relied on the book.\n\n\"Black travelers in those days, in the '50s, had to carry the Green Book if they needed to stay overnight someplace, or if they wanted to know where they could eat,\" Broadwater said.\n\nUnless, of course, there were no Green Book listings en route. \"It was not only frightening, it was very unsafe,\" she said. \"If you're stopping on the side of the road, you can't really sleep.\"\n\n\"So, you'd pull off the road to take a nap or to sleep because there was no place else?\" asked Teichner.\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"Green Book\": Traveling while black\n\n\"Route 66\" was a huge hit for Nat King Cole, but here's the irony: for black travelers looking for places to stay along its more than 2,400 miles, good luck. \"Green Book\" sites were scarce. So-called \"sundown towns\" were plentiful.\n\n\"You'd see a sign on the way in, 'N-word, don't let the sun set on you here,'\" recalled Taylor. \"You could have a 'Green Book,' but you could still find yourself in a sundown town at the wrong time. And sometimes you'd be escorted out of town by law enforcement. Sometimes you'd be harassed, or chased, or worse.\"\n\nOften a safe place to stay was a room in someone's house. Since 2014, a historical marker has stood outside a Green Book-listed tourist home in Columbia, S.C., run by Reggie Scott's mother and aunt.\n\nEighty-nine now, Scott grew up in the Harriet M. Cornwell Tourist Home, and became a musician because of the players who stayed here. \"Cab Calloway was my greatest excitement,\" Scott said. \"He came to the house.\"\n\nIf there's one common denominator Teichner found doing this story, it is the musicians, the unbelievably famous names who were also victims of segregation.\n\nThe Rossonian Hotel and Lounge in Denver was one of more than 80 businesses in the area listed in \"The Green Book.\" \"Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday stayed here,\" Taylor said. \"A lot of times they were performing downtown, where they were welcomed to perform, but not welcomed to stay.\"\n\nThe Rossonian Hotel & Lounge, In Denver, was a business listed in the \"Green Book\" that welcomed African Americans. CBS News\n\nAs Taylor took pictures throughout the Rossonian, now undergoing renovation, she said, \"These places carry a spirit with them, you know, which is why it's so important that they're still here.\"\n\nTaylor put 23,000 miles on her car during just one of her trips around the country documenting more than 9,600 of the \"Green Book\" sites. \"If I had to guess, I'd say about at least 85% were black-owned. But there were sites like Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe in Boston. That was in Southie; that was owned by a white man.\"\n\nCharlie Poulous, a Greek immigrant, opened the restaurant in 1927, and with his partner, Christi Manjourides, served all races, possibly the first restaurant in Boston to do so.\n\nCharlie's Sandwich Shoppe in Boston catered to everybody. CBS News\n\nDamian Marciante, who bought Charlie's in 2017, said there was some backlash: \"The original owners did not care. They just welcomed everybody. If you didn't like it, you didn't come in.\"\n\nIt didn't hurt that the Black Pullman Porters Union had its headquarters upstairs. The railroad workers spread the word about Charlie's even before it began listing in the \"Green Book\" in 1947.\n\nAnd of course, the jazz greats read their \"Green Books,\" and came to Charlie's, including Sammy Davis Jr. \"He used to tap dance out in front of the diner,\" Marciante said.\n\nAs times changed, so did \"The Green Book.\" For sale by subscription and at Esso gas stations, in its heyday it sold two million copies a year. But in the 1948 edition, Victor Green wrote: \"There will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. This is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States.\"\n\nGreen, who died in 1960, didn't live to see that day come, when the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 mandating the end of segregation.

If it's not on his desk, if it's not immediately available for action, it goes away.\"\n\nUnelected officials like Cohn and Porter intentionally thwarting the actions of the elected president \u2013 the exact reverse of what a White House staff is supposed to do.\n\nGoing back to Richard Nixon and Watergate, this is the ninth White House Woodward has covered. \"In the eight others,\" he said, \"I never heard of people on the staff in the White House engaging in that kind of extreme action.\"\n\nIn Woodward's telling, President Trump does not see America as the indispensable nation; he sees it as an international sucker taken advantage of by allies and trading partners. He complained his advisors \"don't know anything about business. All they want to is protect everybody \u2026 that we pay for.\"\n\nAccording to Woodward, the president is obsessed by the fact that the U.S. pays $3.5 billion a year to station troops in South Korea as a first line of defense against the North. \"I don't know why they're there,\" he said at one meeting. \"Let's bring them all home.\" At another meeting, Secretary of Defense James Mattis starkly why the U.S. has 28,000 troops in Korea: \"We're doing this in order to prevent World War III.\"\n\n\"The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.\" - President Trump at the United Nation, Sept. 19, 2017\n\n\n\nThe standoff with North Korea has been eased, for the moment, by the Singapore Summit, which brought together two leaders who had been trading nuclear threats and schoolyard insults.\n\nTrump: \"'Rocket Man' is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.\"\n\n\n\nThe president later made that \"Little Rocket Man\" on Twitter, which he told Rob Porter \"may be my best ever.\" When Porter asked if it might provoke Kim, according to Woodward, the president replied, \"It's leader versus leader, man versus man, me versus Kim.\"\n\nThe most dangerous moment of the standoff, Woodward says, came when the president went to work on another tweet: \"He drafts a tweet saying 'We are going to pull out dependents from South Korea ... Family members of the 28,000 people there.'\"\n\nThat tweet was never sent, because of a back channel message from North Korea that it would regard a pullout of dependents as a sign the U.S. was preparing to attack. \"At that moment there was a sense of profound alarm in the Pentagon leadership that, 'My God, one tweet and we have reliable information that the North Koreans are going to read this as an attack is imminent,'\" Woodward said.\n\nThe president surrounded himself with generals \u2013 active duty and retired \u2013 all of whom had served in Afghanistan. But before he decided on a new Afghan strategy, he insisted on meeting with enlisted men who had served there as well. In a meeting the next day, he lashed out at the generals: \"I don't care about you guys,\" he said to Mattis, Joint Chiefs Chairman General Joseph Dunford, and then-National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. \"'The soldiers on the ground could run things much better than you,' he says to Mattis and Dunford, and there is a 25-minute dressing down of the generals and senior officials,\" said Woodward.\n\nIn a recent tweet, the president acknowledged: \"I'm tough as hell on people and if I weren't nothing would get done.\"\n\nWhen he didn't like a trade deal Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had negotiated with China, the president lit into him at a White House meeting: \"It's a terrible deal. We got screwed. ... You're past your prime. You're not a good negotiator anymore. ... you've lost it. I don't trust you.\"\n\nWhen Economic Adviser Gary Cohn was upset over the president's reluctance to condemn white supremacists for the violence in Charlottesville he went into the Oval Office to resign. According to Woodward, \"Trump said, 'You can't resign. I need you to do tax reform. If you leave, this is treason.' And Trump talked him out of resigning.\"\n\nAfterwards, Chief of Staff John Kelly, who had been in the room, pulled Cohn aside: \"Cohn wrote this down, quote from General Kelly: 'If that was me I would have taken that resignation letter and shoved it up his *** six different times.'\"\n\nWashington Post reporter Bob Woodward, interviewed by CBS News' David Martin. CBS News\n\nThe president has been bracing for Woodward's book since last month when the two lamented \u2013 or at least pretended to lament \u2013 that they had not talked.\n\nWoodward recorded the phone conversation, with the president's permission:\n\nTrump: \"It's really too bad because nobody told me about it, and I would've loved to have spoken to you. You know I'm very open to you. I think you've always been fair.\"\n\nWoodward: \"It's a tough look at the world and your administration and you.\"\n\nTrump: \"Right. Well, I assume that means it's going to be a negative book. ... That's all right. Some are good and some are bad. Sounds like this is going to be a bad one.\"\n\nLast week, when the contents of \"Fear\" began to leak ahead of its scheduled publication, the president said it was worse than bad. \"The book is a work of fiction,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"If you look back at Woodward's past, he had the same problem with other presidents. He likes to get publicity, sell some books.\"\n\nMartin said, \"He's added 'fake books' to his complaints about 'fake news.' Are you ready for a tweetstorm directed at you?\"\n\n\"I've been there before,\" Woodward replied.\n\nIn the 1970s Woodward's stories (written with Carl Bernstein) on Richard Nixon and Watergate were repeatedly denounced (Press Secretary Ron Ziegler said, \"We respect the free press, I respect the free press; I don't respect the type of journalism, the shabby journalism that is being practiced by the Washington Post\"), until the White House was forced to apologize.\n\nWorking on this book, Woodward says he went back to the days of his youth when he and Bernstein made late-night visits to the homes of potential sources.\n\nWoodward recalled, \"In one case I called somebody at 11 o'clock at night and said I'd like to talk. 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll get to it.' And I said, 'Well, how about now?' And he said, 'Now? It's 11 at night!' And I said, 'I'm four minutes away.' 'Okay, come on over for a while.'\"\n\nHe doesn't identify his sources, but most readers will conclude he talked to both Gary Cohn and Rob Porter, along with several other White House officials who quit or were fired.\n\nMartin said, \"The criticism would be, 'You've talked to the people who have an axe to grind against the president.'\"\n\n\"Well, that's just not true,\" he replied. \"Look, I talked to dozens and dozens of people, and have notes and documentation on lots of things.\"\n\nWoodward quotes harsh criticism of the president from some of his closest advisers. Chief of Staff Kelly called his boss an \"idiot.\" Secretary of Defense Mattis said the commander-in-chief acted like, and had the understanding of, \"a fifth- or sixth-grader.\" Both men have denied saying such things.\n\nAnd the president continues to denounce the book at every turn. At a rally Friday night Mr. Trump said, \"These guys that write books and they put phony quotes out all over the \u2013 totally phony quotes. I mean, totally, like, fraudulent books. They're, like, fraudulent books!\"\n\nMartin asked, \"He says the quotes are just not the way he speaks and the quotes are fabricated. What do you say to that?\"\n\nWoodward said, \"He's wrong, and my reporting is meticulous and careful.\"\n\nIn a second interview with CBS' \"Sunday Morning,\" Woodward said he had multiple sources for every claim in the book: \"Multiple interviews with key witnesses. One person I interviewed nine times, and the transcripts of those conversations are 700 or 800 pages.\"\n\n\"700-800 pages for one person?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"How many people did you interview?\"\n\n\"Over a hundred. I would say that maybe half of those are key people.\"\n\nThe theme of Woodward's book \u2013 that aides fear what the president might do if allowed to follow his impulses \u2013 received an unusual confirmation last week, when The New York Times published an anonymous article written by a person described as \"a senior official in the Trump administration.\" \"I work for the president, but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations,\" he or she wrote.\n\nWhen asked if he knows the author's identity, Woodward said, \"I have no idea who it is. It's very important, who it is. It's very important whether this is somebody who witnessed and participated. And quite frankly, if there was a person in the White House or the administration who wanted to tell me what's in that op-ed piece, I would say, 'Okay, name me who was there. What is the specific incident?' As you know, from having read my book, the dates and times and participants [are documented].\"\n\nHe said that without that detail on the op-ed author's story, \"I wouldn't have used it.\"\n\n\"Too vague?\" asked Martin.\n\n\"Well, too vague, and does not meet the standards of trying to describe specific incidents. Specific incidents are the building blocks of journalism, as you well know.\"\n\n\"Fear: Trump in the White House\" is Woodward's 19th book, and he says reporting it took him deeper inside a working White House than he's ever been before.\n\n\"This one was in the belly of the beast,\" he said.\n\nMartin asked, \"And what did you conclude about the beast?\"\n\n\"That people better wake up to what's going on.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mary Walsh."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-little-lies-author-liane-moriarty-on-the-inspiration-behind-latest-novel-nine-perfect-strangers/", "text": "The award-winning HBO series \"Big Little Lies\" captivated fans with its strong portrayal of female friendships.

Most of us walk around with devices that give us instant access to all the knowledge in human history. But before you could Google it, and long before we met Alexa, there was Britannica.\n\nAs in Encyclopedia Britannica, which turns 250 years old this month.\n\nCBS News\n\n\"Britannica did something unique,\" said executive editor Ted Pappas. \"It combined long, scholarly essays with short definitional entries and practical information.\"\n\nFounded in 1768 in Edinburgh, Scotland, Britannica was the brainchild of Colin Macfarquhar, a printer, and Andrew Bell, an engraver. They also had an editor, William Smellie. \"He was a very learned man,\" Pappas said, with (he added) a wonderful capacity for drinking.\n\nSo there they were, two guys with no formal training and one very drunk editor managed to write and publish the first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, in three volumes. Its useful, practical information also contained some guesses: a short article from 1768 spells California with two L's, and says it's a large country of the West Indies \u2013 \"It is uncertain whether it be a peninsula or an island.\"\n\nThe 1768 edition's entry for \"Callifornia.\" CBS News\n\nFrom those humble and sometimes factually-challenged roots, grew a great tree of knowledge, considered by many to be the definitive resource of information over the years, all collected in one place.\n\nBut there were also challenging times for the company: the Great Depression of the 1930s, for example.\n\n\"Folks did not have disposable income, a lot of it, to spend on encyclopedias,\" Pappas told correspondent Luke Burbank. \"Britannica had to find a way to stay relevant.\"\n\nTheir answer? The Answer Girls, an elite corps of women who would research and answer any question a Britannica owner might have.\n\nReaders would ask a question of Britannica on a postcard, attach a stamp, mail it to them, and their library research service would research and type up a detailed report \u2013 up to 10,000 words!\n\nKatharine Hepburn's character in \"Desk Set\" is said to be modeled on the Answer Girls' director.\n\nThen there's the Whole Set Club \u2013 people who've read an entire edition of the books, including George Bernard Shaw, Tesla founder Elon Musk, and writer A.J. Jacobs.\n\nIt took Jacobs about a year and a half to do so. \"Reading six hours a day, every day and anywhere.\"\n\nSimon & Schuster\n\nJacobs read the whole set for a book he was writing. The Encyclopedia Britannica, he said, \"like the Mount Everest of knowledge.\"\n\nHe says the hardest part wasn't even reading all 44 million words; it was trying to keep all those facts and figures to himself. \"I had all this knowledge, I kind of wanted to share it!\" Jacobs said. \"And my wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.\n\n\"She would say, 'Oh, I have a headache.' And I would throw in, 'Oh, you know, the Bayer Aspirin Company patented heroin back in 1898.' And then she would be like, 'Well, that's a dollar!'\"\n\nThese days it's rare that students, like fifth graders at Eisenhower Academy in Joliet, Illinois, would even pick up a physical copy of Britannica. Oliver Bailey said, \"When I first saw it, I was kind of amazed because it was kind of a variety of everything \u2013 on this page you see animals, people, ancient illustrations.\"\n\nSchoolchildren at the Eisenhower Academy in Joliet, Ill., check out the Encyclopedia Britannica - it's like Wikipedia, in a book!

He runs the fact-checking website Snopes.com from a tiny office in his home in Tacoma, Washington.\n\n\"My initial goal was to be, like, this Encyclopedia Britannica for urban legends,\" he said.\n\nSnopes.com\n\nThe site started as a hobby debunking odd rumors, like the one about Walt Disney being frozen when he died. Well, was he? \"No, he wasn't!\"\n\nSome 25 years later, the site gets around 20 million users per month \u2013 people hoping to separate fiction from fact.\n\nBurbank said, \" The very idea of what the objective facts of our world are, are really up for debate right now.\"\n\n\"Well, some people you're just never going to reach or ever convince,\" Mikkelson said. \"The people who are willing to take a critical or a skeptical look at something are the ones that you need to reach.\"\n\nAnd those are the people Britannica is hoping it can still reach, through its various online tools.\n\nMembers can access the encyclopedia's information online. Britannica.com\n\nThe hope, and idea really, being that now, maybe more than ever, facts actually DO matter, and not all information is created equal.\n\nBurbank asked, \"So you guys are really trying to sort of fight the good fight of putting real information into the world?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" said Britannica's Ted Pappas. \"We're trying to surface and bring it to people.

Researchers also estimate the fashion industry will use 25 percent of the world's carbon budget by 2050, the estimated amount of carbon dioxide emissions the planet can have without the worst effects of climate change.\n\nFashion accounts for 8.1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 85 percent of unwanted clothing ends up in landfills, piling up to more than 12 million tons annually.\n\n\"It's daunting.

You're not gonna do anything.'\"\n\nBut Lauren made his ties ... wider \u2026 bolder \u2026 pricier \u2026 and called his brand Polo.\n\nThe ties begat menswear. \"Then I made shirts to go with the ties. And I made suits. And they were different, and they were high quality.\"\n\nToday, the company is valued at over $10 billion.\n\nRalph Lauren preps a model in his showroom for a photo shoot during the rollout of the fashion designer's fall collection, in New York, March 1980.

Ultimately, he told Pauley, it came down to one word:\n\n\"In the world I was growing up, the word s*** was a tough word. It was in my name. So, that name change was not about being Jewish or not Jewish or being something else.\"\n\nFrom the Ralph Lauren 50th anniversary show, part of New York Fashion Week, in Central Park, Sept. 7, 2018. Ralph Lauren\n\nThough his name is now one of the most recognizable brands in the world, Lauren isn't too hung up on labels. \"You don't have to wear a label to be important,\" he said.\n\nAnd if you presumed that Ralph Lauren was wearing Ralph Lauren, you'd be wrong. \"This shirt, I bought at Kmart,\" he said. \"This is living proof of what I believe in. I love the aging of it. I love the rips. I love it all. And I like the way I look in it.\"\n\nRalph Lauren, wearing K-Mart.

But remember: It's how clothes make you feel.\n\n\"I feel cooler now than ever,\" he said.\n\nWhy? How? \"Because I've enjoyed my career, and I'm still working really hard and well.\"\n\n\"Fifty years and counting?\" Pauley said.\n\n\"So, let's hope it goes on.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nralphlauren.com\n\n\n\nPhotos courtesy of Bruce Weber\n\n\n\nStory produced by Kay Lim."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stella-mccartney-fashion-with-a-conscience/", "text": "FASHION FORWARD is a phrase synonymous with \"cutting edge\" -- and it's a term that definitely describes the celebrity designer Alina Cho has been watching:\n\nBuckingham Palace, 2013: Stella McCartney, the daughter of music royalty (yes, her father is Sir Paul) was recognized as fashion royalty, when Queen Elizabeth II honored Stella with an OBE, an officer of the Order of the British Empire.\n\n\"I was very lucky to get the Queen, I have to say, 'cause some days you don't get the Queen,\" McCartney said. \"Yes, I got the Queen!\"\n\nDesigner Stella McCartney. CBS News\n\n\"So I go up and she goes -- and I'd just done the 2012 Olympic Games, drop the mic on that -- and the Queen looks at me and she says, 'So, you seem very busy.' And I was like, Oh my God, I was not expecting the Queen of England to say that I was busy. And I said, 'Well, not quite as busy as you, ma'am.'\"\n\nHard to believe, if you saw McCartney in the final moments before her most recent runway show. The venue couldn't have been more glamorous: the Palais Garnier opera house in Paris. For fashion, this event is the Super Bowl and World Series combined.\n\nStill, amidst the chaos, McCartney wanted her team to remember: All you need is love.\n\nDesigner Stella McCartney with correspondent Alina Cho. CBS News\n\n\"My adrenaline's going,\" Cho said. \"I can't imagine, you seem pretty Zen!\"\n\n\"You know, I'm fine,\" said McCartney. She says at her firm, \"we try not to take ourselves too seriously. But you know what, having said that, it's pretty stressful and pretty crazy. So don't believe anything I just said!\"\n\nInternational fashion critics were shoulder-to-shoulder with the world's most important retailers, and McCartney's celebrity friends, including actress Salma Hayek Pinault and singer Kylie Minogue, and Stella's husband, Alasdhair Willis, who's also in fashion.\n\nJerry and Jessica Seinfeld were in the crowd, too, though the comedian wasn't there for the clothes. \"I like the walking, yeah,\" he said.\n\nA little more than just walking, of course -- the runway represents months and months of work for a show that lasted minutes.\n\n\"I think you always think it could be better,\" McCartney said of the result. \"It's never finished.\"\n\nModels present creations by Stella McCartney during the women's 2018 Spring/Summer ready-to-wear collection fashion show in Paris, October 2, 2017. Patrick Kovarik/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt's a work ethic passed down from her parents.\n\nStella's mom, Linda Eastman, was an American photographer and musician. She and Paul, both vegetarian, raised their family in London and on an organic farm in the English countryside.\n\nShe was also raised on the road, where her parents toured, post-Beatles, in the band Wings.\n\n\"There were stage outfits in the wardrobe, you know, my mum's thigh-high glittery boots,\" McCartney recalled. \"And then the other side was sort of Fair Isle knitwear from Scotland or corduroy trousers or jeans from horse riding.\"\n\nMcCartney was also inspired by her father's classic, tailored look -- and the unconventional life her parents led.\n\nCho asked, \"At what point did you realize, 'My parents are famous'?\"\n\n\"I think I always knew it. But it was just the norm, you know? It was this kind of mad upbringing where one minute you're hanging out with Michael Jackson, and the next minute you're back on a horse in a field or, you know, getting on a school bus.\"\n\nAs a student at school, McCartney began to draw. \"I was sketching always. I was 12 when I made my first jacket. And then I went to Paris when I was 15. I went and interned for Saint Laurent and Lacroix.\"\n\n\"What do you remember about those days?\" Cho asked.\n\n\"I remember being really out of my comfort zone. You know, it was the first time I'd been away from home. I was in Paris, and I was young.\"\n\nExtended interview: Stella McCartney\n\nAnd ambitious. She studied design at one of the world's most prestigious fashion schools. But she didn't let on that her father was a Beatle.\n\nWhen she entered Central Saint Martins, she did not enroll as Stella McCartney. \"No, I grew up always using a different name, really, going into school. I was always Stella Martin!\" she laughed. \"I was always aware that I wanted to try and do things on my own merit, you know? 'Cause otherwise you're quite insecure. You spend your whole career trying to think, 'Did I get this because of that, or did that happen because of this?' And I think you get to a certain stage where you just want to walk in the door with a clean slate and with no kind of baggage or heritage, to a certain extent.\"\n\nIt wasn't always easy, especially at first. In 1997, at age 25, Stella was named creative director of the French fashion house Chlo\u00e9. The industry was skeptical, to say the least. Some, like designer Karl Lagerfeld (who held the same title at Chlo\u00e9 years before) aired his doubts in public.\n\n\"You know what he said, obviously,\" said Cho.\n\n\"You're going to tell me \u2026.\"\n\n\"\"I think they should have taken a famous name, and they did -- in music, but not in fashion.'\"\n\n\"I remember when he said that. Look, I was just, like, 'This is amazing, Karl Lagerfeld is even uttering my name!' But I was very na\u00efve. And I think that that na\u00efvet\u00e9 served me really well. Because I just designed, and I just thought, 'Nobody's gonna know. Nobody'll watch this.' And let me just do what I would instinctively do.\"\n\nIt worked. Under McCartney's direction, sales at Chlo\u00e9 quadrupled, and in 2001 she launched her own label. Her name is now on everything from perfume to sunglasses to platform shoes.\n\nMcCartney's brand uses no animal products (for example, her famous Falabella handbag looks like leather, but is actually a coated canvas). Until recently, that was unheard of in the fashion industry. \"I do look at my upbringing; I think it enabled me to not have to compromise,\" she said.\n\nMcCartney says fashion is one of the least environmentally-friendly industries in the world -- and she wants to change that: \"There's a cheap price put on an animal's life in the fashion industry. So I'm here to suggest that maybe it is broke, and it needs fixing.\"\n\nCho asked, \"Wouldn't it be much easier to use leather or fur?\"\n\n\"Yes, it would; it would be much easier,\" McCartney replied. \"And we'd probably be a much bigger company if we did so. But you know what? Life's too short. And I love the challenge.\"\n\nShe's worked closely with tech companies to develop new fabrics, like man-made silk, and materials made from ocean waste. \"For me,\" she said, \"that is the future of everything.\"\n\nIt's fashion, with a conscience. And it all comes back to how she was raised. Stella's mom was able to see her daughter's first show at Chlo\u00e9, and then died from breast cancer not long after, in 1998.\n\nWhen asked what she thinks her mother would say about her success now, McCartney replied, \"You know, I think she'd just want me to be happy and healthy. But I think at the end of the day, because she's a mummy and I'm her baby, I think she'd just wanna make sure that I was doing okay.\"\n\n\"And your dad seems to think it's really pretty great, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think he's very proud. And I think ultimately as a child, you only ever really want to make your parents proud, right? And now I just want to make my kids proud, and my husband, and the people that I encounter.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-kors-still-on-the-cutting-edge/", "text": "Michael Kors made a name for himself designing clothes for celebrities.

But out in the house where the show will start in just minutes, one man is surprisingly serene:\n\n\u201cOver 35 years of putting on fashion shows, and I don\u2019t get nervous,\u201d said Michael Kors. \u201cBut I guess I\u2019m kind of like the expectant dad, you know? This thing has been a long time coming and you want to see that gorgeous baby.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, even hardened fashion critics agreed, it was gorgeous!

Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nFifty-seven-year-old Michael Kors took a victory lap, and why not? It\u2019s been quite a journey.\n\nHe showed his first season when he was 21 years old, \u201cand by the time the clothes arrived in the stores, I was 22,\u201d he told Braver. \u201cI knew nothing, I have to tell you. I don\u2019t know what UPS was. I mean, I didn\u2019t know how you actually delivered the clothes to the stores!\u201d\n\nBorn on suburban Long Island, he started out as Karl Anderson. But his Mom let him change both his first and last names when she remarried.\n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t all: at age 5, she brought him to a fitting for her wedding gown.\n\n\u201cAnd I just sat in the corner making a face,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd my mom said, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just way too busy -- it had a lot of bows.\u2019 And I said, \u2018You know what? I think it would look better without the bows.\u2019\u201d\n\nWithin a few years of graduating high school, he was working at a Manhattan shop where the owners gave him a chance to design his own creations.\n\nMichael Kors. CBS News\n\nThe response to the pieces the boutique started having made based on his designs was \u201cAmazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it was crazy. We\u2019d put it in the window and you know (snaps his fingers) you immediately knew a woman would come in and say, \u2018Oh, can I try it on?\u2019 And you\u2019d say, \u2018Wait, I\u2019m on to something here; let\u2019s do more of that.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis fledgling line caught the eye of one of fashion\u2019s most powerful prognosticators: Anna Wintour, then at New York Magazine:\n\n\u201cI took the collection and I kind of packed it into these big, messy garment bags, and I jumped on the subway, and I went off to see Anna. And I remember it was her fall issue of New York Magazine, and I was her fashion thing to look forward to.\u201d\n\nToday, as Editor-in-chief of Vogue, Wintour still cares enough for Kors to step out on the red carpet with him at a fundraiser he\u2019s hosting for his favorite charity, God\u2019s Love We Deliver, which provides meals to the sick. And yes, she\u2019s wearing Michael Kors.\n\nBraver asked, \u201cWhat is about his work that you like? What gets you into a Michael Kors?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Michael has always understood the modern American woman, that he is trying to make her look the best that she can,\u201d Wintour replied. \u201cHe\u2019s less concerned about clothes wearing a woman. He wants the woman to wear the clothes.\u201d\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t hurt that some of those women are celebrities: Michelle Obama (in her first official portrait), Viola Davis (at this year\u2019s Golden Globes), and Kate Hudson (on many occasions).\n\n\u201cWhen a woman puts something on, and her whole body changes and her energy changes and her confidence changes, he feels like he\u2019s succeeded,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cAnd he really, really lives and breathes it.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of boldface names in the world of Michael Kors, such as the outfit Blake Lively wore while pregnant: \u201cShe wore it during the day and threw, like, a grey hoodie over it.\u201d\n\nAt his flagship store on Madison Avenue, Kors proudly shows off his couture line: sumptuous fabrics, with prices to match.\n\n\u201cThe handwork, all of this, is all done by hand,\u201d Kors said.\n\n\u201cThis dress must cost thousands of dollars,\u201d said Braver.\n\n\u201cIt does. It does. But you\u2019ll have it forever.\u201d And the stretchy fabric will keep fitting.\n\nBut the bulk of his sales -- and most of the almost 800 other Michael Kors stores -- are devoted to his lower-priced lines. He also designs clothes for men. But, Kors says, his clients all have similar aspirations: \u201cThey want to look fashionable and current. They want to feel powerful but sexy. They want to feel youthful but not ridiculous.\u201d\n\nDesigner Michael Kors with correspondent Rita Braver. CBS News\n\nIt seems hard to imagine, but at one time, Kors almost lost it all. In the early 1990s, the chief backer for his lower-priced line suddenly ran out of money.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Well, if this doesn\u2019t work, like, will I still be me? Will I still be Michael Kors? What will I do?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must have been so scary for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cScary. And what I learned from it is, you really have to stick to your guts. You know, you\u2019ve got to stay focused.\u201d\n\nHe rebuilt the brand, and then in 2004 he got a call that would change his life: \u201cCertainly, reality television and fashion had not merged,\u201d Kors said of \u201cProject Runway.\u201d \u201cAnd I knew \u2018Survivor.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Are designers gonna be, you know, eating bugs and killing each other? What are they gonna be doing?\u2019 I thought it was insane!\u201d\n\nThe show, which judged the work of aspiring designers, took off, in part, because of now-legendary quips by Kors like, \u201cIt\u2019s tablecloth-y to me.\u201d\n\nBut after 10 years, Kors left the show to spend more time on his business, and his marriage with Lance LaPere, his one-time intern who is now creative director of the company.\n\nBraver asked LaPere, \u201cDo you ever tell him, \u2018I don\u2019t think so, that\u2019s not a good idea\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. All the time,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s always a back and forth.\u201d\n\nAnd these days, with a net worth estimated at $1 billion, life is very bright for Michael Kors:\n\n\u201cI am still so curious about what is next, and what\u2019s new,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when you lose that curiosity, you know, quite frankly, then you need to do something else. But I feel more juice today than I did when I was 21.\u201d\n\n\n\nGALLERY: Michael Kors\u2019 red carpet looks\n\n\n\nFor more info:"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/versace-joins-the-no-fur-fashion-houses/", "text": "MILAN - Versace has become the latest fashion house to eliminate fur from its collections, joining Gucci, Giorgio Arman, Hugo Boss among others.\n\nThe Humane Society, which campaigns against the sale of fur, welcomed the decision Wednesday, noting that \"Versace is a massively influential luxury brand that symbolizes excess and glamor.\"\n\nThe group quoted an interview in the Economist Group's \"1843\" magazine with designer Donatella Versace, who said: \"Fur?

A few years back, the wreck of an ancient sailing ship, the Apistos, was found off the coast of East Africa. The ship's name translates as \"unbelievable\" in ancient Greek, and the cargo she carried was pretty unbelievable indeed. Divers found treasure by the ton, including gold-plated sculptures and huge bronze statues crusted in coral.\n\nThe salvagers packed it all off to Venice, where crowds marveled at the treasures of the \"Unbelievable.\" But here's the thing: there really was no ancient shipwreck, or any lost treasure; that whole undersea recovery was staged for the exhibit. And the sculptures on display in Venice weren't created by craftsmen in ancient Rome, but by millennials in matching coveralls at a foundry north of London.\n\nThe treasure, and the made-up story behind it, was yet another outrageous creation by British artist Damien Hirst.\n\n\"We want it to look like it's real, not like it's been manmade, the coral anyway,\" Hirst said.\n\nDamien Hirst examines a work at his studio. CBS News\n\nThe coral might be fake, but the treasure is real enough. Most of these pieces have already sold at prices reportedly up to $5 million each.\n\nCloseup view of one of Damien Hirst's spot paintings. Gagosian Gallery\n\nAt 53, Hirst has been described as a genius, and a con-man, but it's hard to argue with his success. An original work like one of his spot paintings at New York's Gagosian Gallery could be worth more than your house, even though his staff might have done the actual painting.\n\n\"As soon as I could afford it, I had other people to make my paintings,\" he said.\n\nWhy? \"I just don't think it's important. What's important is that the end result is exactly what I want.\"\n\n\"Even if it's not your hands doing the work?\" asked correspondent Tracy Smith.\n\n\"But, I mean, I feel like it is my hands doing the work. It is mine whether I have some to do the work or not, as long as I'm making sure that the end result is what I want.\"\n\nAnd what he wants, sells: One auction in 2008 alone reportedly brought him more than $170 million. In fact, Hirst is one of the richest artists on Earth, with a net worth said to be close to a quarter of a billion dollars.\n\nStill, he can remember leaner times: \"I remember when I opened my first bank account. The bank manager said, 'What do you do?' I said, 'Oh, I'm an art student.' He went, 'Uggh,' and he sort of pulled a face.\n\n\"Now, I get Christmas cards from my bank manager. Which I don't like, either!\"\n\nHirst grew up in Leeds, where he says he failed at pretty much everything except drawing, so he became an artist. A 1991 piece really put him on the map: a 14-foot shark swimming in formaldehyde.\n\n\"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\" (1991) by Damien Hirst. Damien Hirst\n\n\"What was it about the shark, about actually getting a [real] shark, that was important to you? You could have just painted a shark?\"\n\n\"My biggest fear was only making an artwork that you could walk up, look at, think Naah, and walk away from. And I just thought, I didn't want art you could choose against. I thought I wanted art that just got you, whether you liked it or not.\"\n\n\"That was the biggest fear?\"\n\n\"Yeah, to be ignored, yeah. I didn't want to make art what you could ignore.\"\n\nDamien Hirst's \"For the Love of God\" (2007): A human skull cast in platinum and studded with 8,601 diamonds. Damien Hirst\n\nTurns out, he was impossible to ignore. In Damien Hirst's hands, anatomical models became giant sculptures; medicine cabinets became shrines for multi-colored pills. His work often showed a preoccupation with death, like the platinum skull set with more than 8,000 diamonds, that sold for around $100 million.\n\nHirst said, \"I realized it was the first thing I made that I couldn't have in my own home without security! You think, 'Wow, you know, that people could probably kill each other for this!' It's like, you know, you've created quite a monster.\"\n\nHe also created a reputation for partying as hard as he worked. \"When I first started drinking, I never used to get a hangover,\" he said. \"And I measured the last one I had, which was 11 years ago, and it was like seven or eight days, and I was still feeling bad.\"\n\n\"A seven- or eight-day hangover?\"\n\n\"Yeah. 'Cause you're just not able to do it anymore.\"\n\nBut that was then: These days, beauty is his drug of choice.\n\nJust look at the colors in these stunning mosaic patterns. They're even more amazing when you see what they're really made of: butterflies.\n\nMosaics by Damien Hirst, crafted from butterfly collections. CBS News\n\nHe doesn't catch them all himself; the butterflies come from old collections he buys up.\n\nAnd close by, there's a group of artists who execute his vision, spending their days in his Gloucestershire studio, hunched over works in progress, using bolts to keep the butterflies' wings from fluttering off before gluing each one oh so carefully into place.\n\nOf course, not every Damien Hirst piece is as meticulous as this. Some are downright messy, like his spin paintings, where he throws paint onto a spinning canvas to create a very colorful, and very expensive, splatter.\n\n\"My business manager said to me, 'That's an amazing painting you're making, Damien,'\" Hirst said. \"And I said, 'But you think everything I make is amazing.' And he said, 'Yeah, but it is!' And so, it's tempting to want to believe that, but you know it's not true. So, it's like not everything \u2013 you know, everybody makes crap paintings at some point.\"\n\n\"Even you?\" Smith asked.\n\n\"Yeah, everyone. Especially me!\"\n\nThe idea is that anyone can make great art, even those of us with no talent at all. And Smith tried her hand at it.\n\nCorrespondent Tracy Smith tries her hand at flinging paint onto a spinning canvas. CBS News\n\n\"So, if anyone can do it, is it art?\" she asked.\n\n\"If it looks good!\"\n\nBut Hirst was never one to play it safe. He then splashed on some paint thinner, and instantly regretted it. \"So, does that happen to you when you go just a teeny bit too far and think you've ruined it?\" Smith asked.\n\n\"I just did,\" he replied.\n\nSo, maybe it wasn't his favorite, but then again, everything he touches is worth something.\n\nAnd now, after three decades creating one outlandish masterpiece after another, the artist is no longer a young man, but Damien Hirst has somehow found a kind of beauty in that, too.\n\nHe said, \"I've definitely got less time in front of me than behind me, I think I can safely say.\"\n\n\"How are you feeling about that? You, who has confronted death so many times with your work?\"\n\n\"I kind of feel, as you get older, hopefully you get a bit wiser. Maybe I feel a little bit wiser? Maybe!\"\n\nCentrifugal art.

In some cases, cities are commissioning him to scrape and chip into buildings. His work also appears in galleries, often touching on the themes of globalization and urban development.\n\nAnd he's constantly tweaking \u2013 or \"blowing up\" \u2013 his technique; using explosives is one of his newer approaches, which the band U2 used in one of its videos.\n\nWatch Vhils' explosive art as featured in the U2 music video, \"Raised by Wolves\":\n\nVhils said, \"I wanted to create something that was kind of a metaphor for how sometimes you just need a spark.\"\n\nBut working outside in public spaces means his art won't last. \"I like the fact that the artwork will evolve \u2013 it will eventually fade away or be destroyed \u2013 because it makes it more human,\" he said.\n\n\"The finishing touch on your work is, it's falling apart?\" Doane asked.\n\n\"It's the nature of things. Nothing lasts forever.\"\n\nWhile it lasts, the idea is to make people look up and see something differently, using destruction to create, and to reveal another dimension beneath the surface.\n\nA Lisbon street mural by Vhils.

Tony Dokoupil says, yes, they can:\n\nHe pushed, prodded and gouged his masterpieces into existence. But for this hard-living, chain-smoking legend of 20th century art, the beauty he sought to create seemed almost unattainable. Alberto Giacometti hoped to make his artwork feel, however faintly, alive.\n\nHis ragged, bone-thin statues and haunting portraits are just some of the works in \"Giacometti,\" a sweeping retrospective at New York's Guggenheim Museum. It includes some 200 pieces from the four-decade career of this restless perfectionist.\n\nAlberto Giacometti painting in his Paris studio, 1958.

Was he ever, at any point, to your knowledge, at the end of the day, lighting a cigarette and thinking, 'I nailed it, I nailed it'?\"\n\n\"Finally satisfied? Gosh, I hope so!\" laughed Megan Fontanella, co-curator of the exhibit. \"Otherwise he was just toiling away.\n\n\"What I hope visitors will take away from the exhibition, or from their engagement with his work, is a more hopeful approach to the anxieties, to the human condition. I think Giacometti, even in his failures, he was working towards success.\"\n\nThe art world has certainly taken notice. In recent years Giacometti's statues \"The Chariot,\" \"Walking Man,\" and \"Pointing Man,\" have each sold for more than $100 million, making them the three priciest sculptures ever sold at auction.\n\nThe Alberto Giacometti sculptures \"The Chariot\" (left), \"Pointing Man\" (center), and \"Walking Man.\" Fondation Giacometti, Paris; \u00a9 2018 Alberto Giacometti Estate/Licensed by VAGA and ARS, New York.\n\nAnd this year, Hollywood took notice, too, with \"Final Portrait,\" starring Armie Hammer as a man sitting for his picture, and Geoffrey Rush as Giacometti, the sullen creator.\n\nGiacometti was born in Switzerland, in 1901, into a family of artists in a sleepy village near the Italian border. But his career unfolded in Paris, with more romance than a French novel. When he wasn't working in a cramped studio, he was drinking, and talking philosophy with Jean-Paul Sartre, and art with Pablo Picasso.\n\nPsychoanalyst Laurie Wilson, author of the biography \"Alberto Giacometti: Myth, Magic, and the Man\" (Yale University Press), was asked by Dokoupil, \"One could look at the details of his early life and conclude it was bliss.\"\n\n\"Well, one would be wrong,\" she laughed. \"It's always more complicated.\"\n\nGiacometti witnessed the horrors of war in France and fled Paris in 1941. The experience would shatter his sense of the world, and shape his artistic sensibilities in the post-war years to come.\n\nBefore the war, his work was often abstract and smooth.\n\nExamples of pre- and post-World War II sculptures by Alberto Giacometti.

Courtesy Gagosian\n\nAnselm Kiefer was born in 1945 in Germany, in the bombed-out wreckage of World War II. But where most saw ruins, the young Kiefer saw raw material for creation. \"It was not a devastating experience; for me, it was fantastic,\" he said. \"I had all the bricks, all the debris. I could do what I wanted as a little boy. So, I liked it.\n\n\"And still, I think an artist does de-constructings, and he reconstructs.\"\n\nKiefer shot to fame as a subversive young art student with a photo series called \"Occupations\" -- pictures of himself giving the Nazi salute.\n\nAnselm Kiefer's \"Occupations,\" 1969, in Interfunktionen no. 12, 1975, Cologne.

But the point, he says, was to confront Germany's silence on its Nazi past.\n\n\"We never spoke at home about that, you know?\" he said. \"In school, they had, I think, 10 days about the Nazis and, like, 10 days about Alexander the Great. And I felt really that there is something underneath, you know? Something heavy and horrible underneath.\"\n\nRobin Vousden, a Director of Gagosian based in London, says Germany back then just wasn't ready for Kiefer. It took Americans and Israelis to embrace his work.\n\n\"The silence that said, 'Well, we won't talk about war, will we?' Well, Kiefer said, 'Yes, we will!' And both an American audience and an audience in Israel accepted and appreciated that and the courage of it and the dignity of it and the sense of moral responsibility,\" Vousden said.\n\nKiefer's art has since veered away from politics. His more recent work includes giant canvases, the poured lead peeled back -- haunting images that hint at collapsing civilizations.\n\nThat's a central idea for Kiefer, says Vousden -- the cycle of decay and renewal.\n\n\"He's a great landscape painter of our age, and at the absolute heart of his practice is the idea that landscapes are the landscape of history,\" Vousden said. \"He's very aware of the fragility of the landscape. And the great cracking that you see on the surface of his paintings is intended to tell you that it all can be swept away by the deluge, by the flood, by the fall of man. And we all have to start again.\"\n\nKiefer's paintings and sculptures feature in many of the finest art collections in the world.\n\nCurrently, his work is part of a joint exhibition at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia along with work of the great sculptor Auguste Rodin.\n\nAn installation view of the exhibition \"Kiefer Rodin\" (2017) at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. Courtesy of the Barnes Foundation\n\nKiefer explained to Palmer that he lives with his paintings: \"Every day, I have to go [past them] to go in my studio. And then sometimes I stay and I look, 'Oh, let's bring it down and change it.'\"\n\n\"And sometimes the opposite? Do you think, 'You know what? That's finished'?\"\n\n\"Sometimes I have to tell 'It's finished' because they want to do a show, a gallery, or, you know, sometimes I have to sell something,\" he laughed. \"Then I decide 'This is finished'!\"\n\nAnselm Kiefer with correspondent Liz Palmer at his Paris studio. CBS News\n\n\"Yeah, but your inclination would be to keep changing all of them?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, sure, all the time, yes.\"\n\nKiefer lives with his teenage children outside Paris in what used to be a department store warehouse. His art is everywhere \u2026 inside, and out on the grounds, where a forest of giant metal sunflowers crowds around sculptures of old planes.\n\nHe moved to Paris after running out of space at his 200-acre estate in the south of France -- transformed into a dystopian landscape of teetering towers and tunnels to nowhere. One day, after his death, Kiefer hopes it will open to the public as a museum.\n\nBut now -- very much alive \u2013 Kiefer remains astonishingly prolific.\n\nPalmer asked, \"If somebody had said to an 18-year-old Anselm Kiefer, 'One day you are going to be one of the greatest living artists'\u2026\"\n\nArtist Anselm Kiefer. CBS News\n\n\"Oh, I didn't need that someone told me that. It was clear for me,\" he replied.\n\n\"You knew?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I noted in my journal. 'I'm the greatest painter.'

War rages in Europe, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt must convince Americans their country will have to enter the war against the Nazis.\n\nSo, in the midst of one of the most dire periods in history, he delivered a speech. Key to that speech, the \"Four Freedoms\" \u2013 goals he believed were worth fighting for.\n\n\"The Four Freedoms, as articulated, did not garner much attention,\" said Laurie Norton-Moffatt, the director of the Norman Rockwell Museum. \"Americans had little appetite to return to war. World War I had been devastating in its consequences. America was still coming out of the Great Depression, and there were many people who were still struggling for housing and jobs and food.\"\n\nSo, the speech fell flat \u2026 until artist Norman Rockwell took Roosevelt's words and translated them into iconic American images:\n\n\"Freedom of Speech\" \u2026 \"Freedom of Worship\" \u2026 \"Freedom From Want\" \u2026 and \"Freedom From Fear.\"\n\nNorman Rockwell's paintings illustrating President Franklin D.

(The exhibit next travels to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich.)\n\nSpeaking of Rockwell's painting of Freedom From Want,\" of a family gathered for a bounteous Thanksgiving dinner, Moffatt acknowledged that, for many Americans at the time, such a feast would have been a luxury: \"This was an aspirational dinner.\"\n\nCurator Laurie Norton-Moffatt (right), with Norman Rockwell's \"Freedom From Want.\" CBS News\n\nBut what do The Four Freedoms mean today?\n\nA companion exhibit, on display at Hunter College in New York City, seeks to answer that question, with reinterpretations of Rockwell's images.\n\n\"United We Stand\" by Benny Bing, 2017.

His reinterpretation of the Four Freedoms combines photography with digital painting techniques.\n\n\"Norman Rockwell was the quintessential, all-American painter. He showed you the American landscape \u2013 everyone being loved, everyone safe, everyone fed, a beautiful American world, except not if you're Mexican, not if maybe you're Hindu, not if you're black.\"\n\nSo, in Peterson's version of Rockwell's \"Freedom of Speech,\" instead of a young white man, there's an African-American woman.\n\nFor \"Freedom from Want\" with its traditional Thanksgiving table, Peterson shows himself with his husband.\n\nArtist Pops Peterson's interpretations of Normal Rockwell's \"Freedom of Speech\" (titled, \"What the Hell?\") and \"Freedom From Want\" (titled \"Thanksgiving Gay Dinner\"). \u00a9 Pops Peterson\n\nHis \"Freedom of Worship\" depicts a Baptist minister preaching to people of varying faiths. And then, there's his \"Freedom From Fear,\" which he titled \"Freedom From What?\"\n\n\"Do we have freedom from fear? No. What do we have freedom from?\" he said.\n\n\"What you're really saying is, for a lot of people, those freedoms don't exist,\" Werner said.\n\n\"Exactly. And the fear does exist.\"\n\nSo, in his image, an African-American man putting his children to bed looks over his shoulder; the newspaper headline here? \"I Can't Breathe,\" a reference to Eric Garner, who died after police put him in a chokehold in 2014.\n\nPops Peterson's \"Freedom of Faith\" (left), and \"Freedom From What?\" \u00a9 Pops Peterson\n\n\"I just want to show what's going on on the other side of the railroad tracks,\" said Peterson, who began to cry.\n\n\"And that's really emotional for you,\" said Werner.\n\n\"Because we're always there, and nobody's looking. I mean, it was really nice in the suburbs for the nice white family to be safe from the Blitzkrieg, I mean, obviously they were representing all Americans. And this is a current image, and the father is just wondering, what is going on on my street?

You don't have to be a raging lunatic to go to therapy to improve. It's just self-love, and taking care of thyself is what really inspires you to take care of each other.\"\n\nBell said that to write the script, she envisioned herself as each character, but she was especially excited to play Alice.\n\n\"It's really fun to take on characters who are not an obvious casting choice for me,\" she said. \"Alice sort of apologizes for the space she takes up in the world and she's extremely low-status and she's repressed and that's just something I haven't gotten to do in my career.\"\n\nBell admitted she has an agenda in making this film.\n\n\"It has a happy ending and it's built that way and I always wanted it that way,\" she said. \"I really wanted this story and investigation to end with hope, because I think ultimately as a previous unromantic, I was hoping deep down to be proven wrong.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kelis-celebrates-national-chocolate-milkshake-day-talks-about-her-life-as-a-chef/", "text": "It's pretty obvious why Kelis is the perfect celebrity spokesperson for Tuesday's National Chocolate Milkshake Day: \"When people see milkshakes, they think of me and the song,\" she told CBS News.\n\nThe singer teamed up with Baileys to create a recipe for the occasion, but the song \"Milkshake\" is not the only thing that makes Kelis uniquely qualified for the job.

I don't care about the fame.\"\n\nThe singer played new songs, his biggest hits and a special cover of Train's \"Drops of Jupiter\" on the radio show on Tuesday.

Maybe I'll go once a week to make sure they're shiny,\" he joked.\n\nThe singer explained why he got so excited about the project.\n\n\"I love all forms of art,\" he said. \"When the idea was brought to me about Jim Bachor transforming rugged, unloved potholes into beautiful art, I was very fascinated by it. It's a unique way to get it in the streets of Nashville where tons of people walk by to see it and promote my album and music. There's one that says 'No Stopping You' -- it's a reminder for people to stay present and focused.\"\n\nBrett Eldredge and Jim Bachor teamed up for a series of mosaic pieces in Nashville and Chicago, inspired by Eldredge's music.

It's such a high from my fans. A smile on their face is what I live for, and the lyrics on their lips and their sense of wonder is that feeds my sense of wonder.\"\n\nHe also added that meditation has helped him become mindful and appreciative.\n\n\"You can always make time for 10 minutes for your day, to take it all in and be still and be thankful and grateful for what you got, and sit there in silence and let the world go by,\" he said. \"It'll still be there in 10 minutes.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/christina-milian-talks-share-your-care-day-and-new-show-90s-house/", "text": "As the co-host of MTV's new \"90's House,\" Christina Milian has a special place in her heart for throwbacks, so the singer and actress was happy to team up with the Care Bears for their annual Share Your Care Day on Sept. 9 that encourages acts of kindness.\n\n\"It's basically a celebration of sharing with your children how to care with other people around the world and we teach them how to care through basic actions, like being nice to others, sharing your toys or giving to others as well,\" Milian explained to CBS News. \"There's a beauty in Care Bears -- it's all about positive encouragement.\"\n\nMilian said she is especially happy she and her daughter, Violet Madison Nash -- a Care Bears fan -- will celebrate the day together.\n\n\"She was pleasantly surprised to see I knew about it as a child, too,\" said Milian. \"Every generation thinks they're new to something, but it's come with passing generations and it's really great.\"\n\nMilian said her daughter is most proud of sharing her toys.\n\n\"We go through her room every couple of months and gather toys she doesn't use,\" said Milian. \"She says, 'You know what?

And let's just say, most have not been very kind, or accurate; they are usually stereotyped as brutish, howling and stupid.\n\nSo, why have Neanderthals gotten such a bad reputation?\n\nOn the latest episode of CBS News' podcast \"Mobituaries,\" Mo Rocca explores the bad rap our extinct human cousins have received.\n\nKate Wong, a senior editor of Scientific American, tells Rocca of a Neanderthal skeleton found in the town of La Chapelle-aux-Saints in France in 1908 and how it was badly misinterpreted by biologist Marcel Boule. \"The image that kind of came out of his work was hairy and pretty apelike,\" she said.\n\nThat fossil, called \"the Old Man of La Chapelle,\" just happened to be an older arthritic individual, which explained why it did not stand upright. It set back the public's perception of Neanderthals for generations.\n\nBut things are changing for the Neanderthals. Recent incredible breakthroughs in the field and in the laboratory have shown that our extinct human cousins were pretty amazing, and on par with modern humans, cognitively and creatively.\n\nNeanderthals did cave paintings, wore jewelry, and created sticky pitch in a complicated process to attach their tips to their spears when hunting.\n\nSaid professor John Hawks from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, \"If I had to assign an engineering class to figure out how this was done, they would have a hard time of it.\"\n\nPerhaps the most incredible recent breakthrough on this topic has been that most humans of today carry with them a certain percentage of Neanderthal DNA. Rocca talks to Princeton professor of genomics Joshua Akey to find out what it means to be part Neanderthal. \"We have always said that our genomes are a mosaic of different ancestors, and I think what we've learned more recently is it's a mosaic of both recent ancestors and very distantly-related different types of human ancestors,\" said Akey.\n\nRocca also welcomes comedian and author Michael Ian Black, whose genetic test results showed he was a whopping 2.9% Neanderthal.\n\nListen to this week's episode of \"Mobituaries.\" You can download the episode on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Megaphone, Stitcher, or Spotify.

The federation is now providing lightsabers to fencing clubs and training lightsaber instructors in the ways of the Jedi.\n\nCompetitors battle during a national lightsaber tournament in Beaumont-sur-Oise, north of Paris. AP\n\nFederation secretary general Serge Aubailly told the AP he hopes the popularity of Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader will draw more young people to fencing. \"Cape and sword movies have always had a big impact on our federation and its growth,\" Aubailly said. \"Lightsaber films have the same impact. Young people want to give it a try.\"\n\nThe new sport will be governed a new set of rules, some of which are more typical of fencing than others. Fighters still need to wear masks and armor for protection, but matches take place inside a circle taped on the floor rather than a rectangular strip. Five points are awarded for strikes to the head or body, three points for the arms or legs, and one point for the hands. The first to reach 15 points \u2014 or the highest score after three minutes \u2014 wins the match. \"Sudden death\" occurs if both fighters reach 10 points; in this case, the first to strike the head or body wins. To add to the entertainment value of the fight, strikes are only awarded if the fighter firsts swings their lightsaber behind them as they do in the films.\n\nThe Dark Side that the federation is fighting is the childhood obesity epidemic and the popularity of more sedentary video games. \"With young people today, it's a real public health issue. They don't do any sport and only exercise with their thumbs,\" Aubailly told the AP. \"It's becoming difficult to [persuade them to] do a sport that has no connection with getting out of the sofa and playing with one's thumbs.

Pink gets these associations of dumb, immature girls, then a lot of girls and women go, 'That's not me.'\"\n\nBut, Steele says, pink entered the world gender-free \u2013 and has led quite a colorful life. \"People want to believe very simple stories about color,\" she said. \"And in fact, like culture in general, it's more complicated.\"\n\nIn the 18th century, an expensive South American dye made pink fabric chic. \"Paris was the center of fashion, and so pink became the ultra-fashionable color,\" said Steele. \"Men wore it, women wore it. Boys, girls wore it. Interiors were pink.\"\n\nPink as worn by the French aristocracy, male and female. CBS News\n\n\"So, it wasn't about gender?\" asked correspondent Faith Salie.\n\n\"It was about class. It was about being fashionable and aristocratic.\"\n\nJust after the Civil War, pink hit mainstream America. In the novel \"Little Women,\" one of the characters has twins - a girl and a boy: \"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French fashion, so you can always tell.\"\n\nSteele said, \"By 1840s the French had decided pink was for girls or women, and blue was for boys. The Americans decided that you could really make money out of color-coding children's clothes.\"\n\nBut first, there was confusion: many stores in America thought pink was for boys. Steele said, \"And the other half go, 'Oh no, no, no, no. Pink is for girls and blue is for boys. 'Little Boy Blue come blow your horn \u2026' [and] pink is for girls.\"\n\nCorrespondent Faith Salie with curator Valerie Steele, at a recent Fashion Institute of Technology exhibition in New York City devoted to the color pink. CBS News\n\nThe \"dye,\" shall we say, was cast. Businesses started seeing green once pink was linked with notions of sugar and spice and everything nice. Adam Alter, who teaches marketing at NYU's Stern School of Business,\" said, \"There's a lot of inertia in an association like that. Once it's established, it's tough for it to change.\"\n\nBut decades later, a little girl bounded on the scene who shook up pink's sweet image: Eloise.\n\nThe children's book heroine Eloise, from an illustration by Hilary Knight. Simon & Schuster\n\n\"She basically owned a version of pink and said, 'Pink can also be mischievous. It could be a little bit more playful,'\" Alter said. \"That was a really good thing for the color pink. Gave it this extra dimension, and meant that pink didn't just mean being very well-behaved and doing exactly the right thing all the time. It also meant being yourself, and being the real version of who you are.\"\n\nHilary Knight created the illustrations for the book \"Eloise.\" He decided she'd be only black, white, and bathed in bright pink.\n\n\"When we started the book, the concept of the background color was never planned \u2013 'This will empower little girls,'\" Knight said. \"But it did. It absolutely did.\"\n\nThe book became a sensation. \"Life Magazine published six pages directly from the book,\" Knight said. \"It was on the bestseller list.\"\n\nSoon its author, Kay Thompson, was on the big screen, playing a fashion editor with a rosy idea in \"Funny Face\": \"Red is dead, blue is through, green's obscene, brown's taboo. Think pink!\"\n\nKay Thompson, the author of \"Eloise,\" played fashion magazine editor Maggie Prescott, throwing shade on non-pink colors, in the 1957 musical \"Funny Face.\" Paramount Pictures\n\nKnight said, \"Everybody knew about Eloise and the color pink. The book was a giant success. The color was a big success. It was why she is saying, 'Pink.'\"\n\nBut 1950s America had a less spirited message to spread. Steele said, \"Pink became a part of the whole sort of feminine mystique. Push women back in the home and get them to do feminine things.\"\n\nAnd so began pink's dark period. While some of the \"gentler sex\" embraced pink, some '60s feminists saw red.\n\n\"So, when the little girls want to buy all the pink toys, a lot of mothers go, 'I don't really like that kind of bubble-gum Barbie thing. I don't want my daughter to just buy into that.'\"\n\nThat is, until recently. As filmmakers, they showed off the shade's smarts (like Reese Witherspoon's resume printed on pink, scented paper in \"Legally Blonde\"), and its sass (as in \"Mean Girls,\" in which Wednesday is Pink Day).\n\nOne of these things is not like the others: Reese Witherspoon in the 2001 comedy \"Legally Blonde.\" MGM\n\n\"They're emphasizing they're girls, and they're girls empowered,\" Steele said.\n\nEspecially girls \u2013 and women \u2013 with a cause. The pink ribbon brought awareness to breast cancer, and other groups saw its power.\n\nWomen with pink hats gather Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017 for the Women's March on Washington. Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\n\"A lot of activist movements have embraced pink as a political color for women,\" Steele said. \"When you saw all of those pink pussy hats, you realized if you want to be noticed, wear pink.\"\n\nAnd that, Steele says, leaves everyone \u2026 in the pink.\n\n\"Over the last twenty years, different genders, sexualities and races have gotten together and said, 'Pink doesn't have to be childish and feminine. Pink can be powerful, androgynous, political, cool.' It's kind of a dream color.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mary Raffalli."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dionne-warwick-a-singular-voice/", "text": "In a recording studio in 1966, a classic came to life.

Over a six-decade career, she's charted 56 hits in the Billboard Top 100, and won five Grammy Awards, with songs that generations have swayed to \u2026 sobbed to \u2026 and loved to.\n\nShe said, \"You know I say it all the time, and I truly mean it: to be a part of people's 'smile times' in their lives, you can't beat it.\"\n\nMo Rocca met with Warwick near her home in South Orange, New Jersey, not far from the church where it all began. She started singing there when she was six years old: \"I'm standing on books, so people can see me over the lectern,\" she said. \"And all of a sudden I opened one eye and I noticed that everybody was smiling, and that was my very first standing ovation!\"\n\nSinger Dionne Warwick with correspondent Mo Rocca. CBS News\n\nBy 18, she was singing backup for Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and The Exciters. Her voice was too distinctive to remain in the background for long, and it was exactly what the songwriting team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David needed.\n\nRocca asked, \"Were you surprised that they wanted you to sing lead vocal?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I was, yeah,\" Warwick said. \"Why me? I haven't a clue as to why he chose me. Although I did read music.\"\n\n\"Because these songs are not that easy to sing.\"\n\n\"These songs are horrendously not easy to sing!\"\n\nIn 1963, the trio put out their first release, \"Don't Make Me Over.\" Her actual last name, Warrick, was misspelled on the album.\n\nThe name stuck \u2026 and so did the success, including the 1963 song \"Walk On By,\" about someone who's been jilted. \"It's a way of saying, 'You know what? Skeedaddle,'\" Warwick said.\n\nRocca asked, \"What was the Bachrach-David song you liked singing the most?\"\n\n\"All of them,\" she replied.\n\n\"Well, not all of them.\"\n\n\"All of them \u2026 except 'San Jose'!\" she laughed.\n\nWhy does she hate it? \"'Whoa whoa whoa whoa uh huh\"? No, I don't think you wrote this song!\"\n\nIf Warwick seems unclassifiable, unique in sound and style, it may be because of the surprising variety of musical mentors who raised her: Her godmother was jazz singer Sarah Vaughan (\"She was Aunt Sass to us\"); Ol' Blues Himself took her under his wing (\"Frank Sinatra, who I affectionately still refer to as Poppy, I became his surrogate child\"); screen legend Marlene Dietrich taught her how to dress; and Lena Horne, who, she says, gave her the most valuable advice of all: \"Always, always be you. You cannot be anyone but you.\"\n\nAnd in 1973, being Dionne meant breaking with Bacharach and David.\n\nRocca asked, \"Was that a tricky period for you?\"\n\n\"You know what, it was actually a blessing,\" she replied. \"It gave me an opportunity to enjoy my home, have my babies, be a housewife.\"\n\nAfter a hiatus, Warwick was back, and in a big way. In 1974, she had her first number one:\n\n\"Then Came You.\" That was followed by a couple of Grammy-winners: \"I'll Never Love This Way Again\" and \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu.\" \"So it was like, 'Oh, she really didn't need Bacharach-David to continue her career.' No, I didn't.\"\n\nWarwick would reunite with Bachrach, and team with Gladys Knight, Elton John and Stevie Wonder, for the most popular song of 1986: \"That's What Friends Are For,\" which helped raise awareness and money for AIDS research.\n\nWarwick was also the host of TV's dance music show, \"Solid Gold,\" and more controversially, as the pitchwoman for the Psychic Friends Network.\n\nHow does she look back on that experience? \"I think it was wonderful,\" she said. \"Made a wonderful living. The exposure was incredible. Thought people forgot that I sang for a living \u2013 they thought I was a psychic!\"\n\nShe's comfortable talking about that experience, but not much else that's personal. She declared bankruptcy, battled with the IRS, and in 2012 her cousin, superstar Whitney Houston, died. In an unsubstantiated claim in a recent documentary, Warwick's late sister, Dee Dee, was accused of molesting Houston as a child.\n\nOf Whitney as a girl, Warwick said, \"I loved her very deeply; still do. Enormously talented young lady. Gorgeous to look at. She's a sweetheart, you know, and will always be. And that's all I'm gonna say about Whitney.\"\n\nAt 78, and a proud grandmother, Dionne Warwick still performs, and has a new album coming out this year. We've been listening to her for so long, she's become a part of our lives.\n\nShe admitted, \"I like me, and apparently, all those who I call my friends, and I have a lot of them, kind of like Dionne, too, right?

His crime trilogy will soon be made into big-budget movies by acclaimed director Ridley Scott. \"It's about internal borders, about ethical borders, moral borders, political borders and whether we cross them or not \u2013 and if we cross them, can we ever cross back?\"\n\nWinslow has been a fierce critic of President Trump on Twitter, and even took out a full-page ad in The New York Times criticizing his border policy.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump, You've corrupted the news cycle but I know how much you like tweets I sent you one today - a full page ad in @nytimes pic.twitter.com/ZNX9CwjCqY \u2014 Don Winslow (@donwinslow) June 25, 2017\n\nGlor asked, \"Can you imagine seeing a wall out there someday?\"\n\n\"No,\" he laughed. \"I've been on every mile of this border, every mile.

Those gates are always open.\"\n\nWilliam Morrow\n\nWinslow believes a wall would make the drug situation worse, by driving small-time smugglers into the hands of big-time dealers. \"What we critically have to understand is that a border is also something that joins two communities, two countries and two cultures,\" he said.\n\n\"You think we forget that sometimes?\"\n\n\"We've completely forgotten it.\"\n\nGlor asked, \"What is it that people don't understand about what's happening there right now?\"\n\n\"There is no invasion of the United States through this border. These are not armed people,\" Winslow said. \"There are people, for the most part, hard-working, family people trying to find a better life, something we used to welcome in this country. Are there bad people in these caravans? Are there some criminals? Of course. I would also argue to you there were bad people on the Mayflower. There were bad people who came into Ellis Island. But that's what built this country.\"\n\nDon Winslow didn't expect to be spending his sixties speaking his mind about politics. With 21 novels to his name, he is now one of the most in-demand crime writers in America. But for many years, it wasn't that way.\n\n\"You're a late bloomer,\" said Glor.\n\n\"It's an overnight success, but it was an arctic night, you know?\" he said. \"It's the job I've always wanted, and I'm grateful now that I have it.

We were always allowed to read anything we wanted.\n\n\"And I thought, you know, if I could make my living telling stories, that's the way I'd like my life to go.\"\n\nWinslow published his first book in 1991. He sold just enough to barely pay the bills, but he kept at it. He said there were multiple times when he thought about packing it in.\n\nGlor asked, \"So, what is it that gets you through that? You just continuing to work?\"\n\n\"Yeah, write a new book.\"\n\n\"Stop complaining, stop thinking; just work?\"\n\n\"That's it. That's always it.\"\n\nFinally, four years ago, Winslow hit the big-time, with the blockbuster international bestseller, \"The Cartel.\" It's this view, he says, as viewed in the hills east of San Diego, that gives him his inspiration. \"It's a lotta times where I come to think, come to create characters,\" he said.\n\nCharacters like those in his 2017 bestseller \"The Force,\" a raw and profane tale of an anti-hero cop in New York City.\n\nThe novel is set in Upper Manhattan, where Winslow once worked as a private investigator. It describes a heroin mill run out of an apartment complex. Remarkably, just before the book was published, a real-life heroin mill was uncovered in the very building Winslow used to base his fictional building. [Editor's Note: There were no drug busts in the Park Terrace Gardens buildings.]\n\nWinslow is a meticulous researcher. A team of one, he spends years digging for details, writing 12 hours a day, in an old converted gas station near his California home.\n\n\"You're addicted to it,\" said Glor.\n\n\"I think addiction might be the accurate phrase, yeah. Yeah. You know, it's an addiction, and I love doing it,\" he said.\n\n\u2026 a love and a passion that's given Don Winslow a platform to speak his mind: \"I'm not interested in apologizing.

Chuck Schumer said Friday, after President Trump announced he would sign legislation to reopen the government for three weeks. \"We will do everything we can to make sure they won't have to, and this past month has proven just how vital government services are to the American people, whether it's our food safety, our airports, our national parks, our economy, our national security and so much else.\"\n\nHere's a look at what was affected by the 2018-2019 partial government shutdown, and some of the longer-term impacts as things get back up and running.\n\nWhat was shut down during the shutdown\n\nThe FDA initially did not do routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities. It recalled workers to restart inspections of what are considered \"high-risk\" foods in mid-January after the routine inspections were briefly halted due to the shutdown.\n\nThe Smithsonian museums and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., shut their doors on January 2. The National Zoo also closed, although animals were still cared for by zoo workers.\n\nBoth the Smithsonian museums and the zoo are set to reopen on Tuesday, January 29.\n\nMany national parks also closed, but several remained opened during the shutdown, albeit without services. Sanitary conditions rapidly deteriorated at many of the nation's parks, with restroom toilets overflowing and trash piling up.\n\nThe National Park Service said in a statement that it is \"preparing to resume regular operations nationwide though the schedule for individual parks may vary depending on staff size and complexity of operations.\" Independence National Historical Park, including the Liberty Bell Center, in Philadelphia has already opened.\n\nVolunteer Alexandra Degen cleans a restroom at Joshua Tree National Park on Jan. 4, 2019, in Joshua Tree National Park, California. Getty\n\nImmigration courts closed, forcing judges to indefinitely postpone hearings scheduled months in advance.\n\nE-Verify, the government immigration system and database employers use to check and confirm employees are eligible to work in the United States, was out of service during the shutdown. It typically takes just a few seconds for E-Verify to compare an employee's records against DHS and Social Security records. A few hundred E-Verify employees were allowed to return to work this week, although they were temporarily assigned to non-E-Verify related tasks during the shutdown.\n\nAgencies including the NSF, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Parks Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and NOAA had to stop most of their work during the shutdown.\n\nLarge-scale instruments like NASA's Stratoscopheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy \u2013 the \"flying telescope\" \u2013 had to stop operations. Eventually bringing such instrumentation back up to speed requires over a week. NASA managers and engineers working on the agency's high-priority commercial crew program remained on the job without pay, continuing preparations for the first unpiloted launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft on a long-awaited test flight in February\n\nSome airlines who took delivery of new aircraft in December and January forced to park those new planes as they have to receive Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) certification to carry passengers, and the people who certify the aircraft are furloughed. That does not impact an airlines' operations, but it did cost them revenue to have planes sitting unused, CBS News' Kris Van Cleave reported.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has been unable to investigate the 97 major accidents that have occurred since the shutdown began. They resume service on Monday.\n\nWhat was open and operating\n\nMail was still delivered. Social Security checks were still going out to recipients, and Medicare and Medicaid are unaffected by the partial shutdown.\n\nWhile TSA officers were working without pay, screeners working at the 22 airports that have private contractors handling airport security continued to get paid during the shutdown.\n\nOn January 7, the White House promised that tax refunds would not be affected by the shutdown, and later that day, the IRS confirmed it will begin to process tax returns for refunds on January 28. However, the IRS recalled thousands of workers later in January specifically to work processing on refunds.\n\nIRS employee can't afford to return to work without pay\n\nThe National Hurricane Center website continued to be updated and maintained because its information is needed for the protection of life and property.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation continued because it does not depend on a congressional appropriation for its funding. Trump associate Roger Stone was indicted and arrested as part of the investigation on Friday, the last day of the shutdown.\n\nNutrition benefits issued through the USDA, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), were available through January and February. Child nutrition programs, like School Lunch and School Breakfast, were guaranteed to keep operating into February.\n\nForest Service law enforcement and emergency response efforts continued.\n\nU.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, which deals with naturalization and citizenship, was uninterrupted because its operations are funded by user fees.\n\nVeterans still got their benefits because the Veterans Affairs Department was among those funded through September 2019.\n\nPassport services were still offered during the shutdown.\n\nConsequences of the shutdown\n\nThe Associated Press reported that despite the IRS continuing to process tax returns, the absences of large contingents of recalled workers during the shutdown could still lead to delayed tax returns.\n\nThe shutdown particularly affected the aviation industry. Flights in and out New York City's LaGuardia airport were delayed on Friday morning due to government shutdown-related staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, according to a notice issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nFinancial hardship due to the government shutdown has prompted some federal airport workers to call out of work causing some passenger interruptions. On Friday morning, an American Airlines flight out of Monroe, Louisiana, bound for Dallas with 26 passengers was canceled due to a TSA officer shortage in Monroe, according to an airline's spokesperson.\n\nAbout 7.6 percent of the TSA workforce had an \"unscheduled absence\" on Thursday, up from 3 percent a year ago, according to the federal agency. Earlier this week, the TSA requested 250 screening officers volunteers to make up for the call outs.\n\nThe union for flight attendants expressed concern about the impact of the shutdown. \"This is exactly what AFA and other aviation unions have been warning would happen,\" wrote Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, in a statement. \"The aviation system depends on the safety professionals who make it run. They have been doing unbelievably heroic work even as they are betrayed by the government that employs them.\"\n\nAir traffic controllers also sounded the alarm, saying in a statement that flying could be less safe with more air traffic controllers taking unscheduled absences due to financial difficulties. \"Air traffic controllers are required to report fit for duty every shift. It is a very high threshold of fitness demanded by the seriousness of the job,\" the statement said. \"This shutdown has caused a tremendous amount of added stress for them on top of what is already a difficult and stressful job.\"\n\nThe FBI Agents Association also warned this week that the shutdown was not only hurting individual FBI employees and their families, but hampering key operations. Some of those affected operations, according to a series of statements the association released Tuesday, included efforts to thwart the same criminal enterprises Mr. Trump claims the shutdown is meant to defeat in the long run.\n\nEconomic impact\n\nFederal workers and their families were particularly affected. Several food banks opened around the country to assist federal employees who could not afford to buy groceries. In Washington, D.C., one pop-up kitchen providing free meals to affected workers is run by the non-profit organization World Central Kitchen, which was founded by celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s.\n\nAmericans who rely on certain services from the federal government were also impacted by the shutdown, such as people who relied on federal assistance to pay their rent.\n\nHundreds of furloughed federal workers line up outside the World Central Kitchen in downtown January 22, 2019 in Washington, D.C. Getty Images\n\nThe shutdown also dragged down economic growth. Analysts from S&P Global recently estimated the economic damage from the shutdown was surpassing the $5.7 billion in proposed funding for Mr. Trump's southern border wall that prompted the Washington breakdown in the first place.\n\nWhen will federal workers be paid?\n\nIt's unclear when federal employees will be receiving their paychecks, despite Mr. Trump's assurances. A senior administration official said Friday, \"Recognizing the urgency of getting federal employees paid quickly, the administration is taking steps to ensure they receive pay as soon as possible. Since specific payroll issues vary by agency, employees can find more information about paycheck details by reaching out to their agency.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said Friday he expects federal employees to receive paychecks next week.\n\nA Democratic Senate aide said the Congressional Research Office told Collins' office the agencies should be able to process paychecks within a few days after the continuing resolution is signed. That will include backpay.\n\nThe next scheduled paycheck for most federal workers is February 8. That is the latest they would receive their first paycheck of 2019.\n\nThe Coast Guard, which is on a different pay schedule for active duty personnel, said it will take three to five days to get paychecks processed once a continuing resolution is signed.\n\nGrace Segers, Kate Smith, Kathryn Watson, Ellen Uchimiya, Kris Van Kleave and Arden Farhi contributed reporting"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economy-likely-to-resume-steady-growth-but-some-money-will-never-be-made-up/", "text": "The U.S. economy will likely resume its steady growth now that the government has reopened, though economists say some scars \u2014 for the nation and for federal workers \u2014 will take time to heal.\n\nMost analysts estimate that the 35-day partial shutdown shaved a few tenths of a percentage point from annual economic growth in the first three month of 2019. They say growth should pick up in the coming months, though some of the money federal workers and contractors didn't spend in the past five weeks \u2014 on such items as movie tickets, restaurants and travel \u2014 will never be made up.\n\nHaving gone without two paychecks, many federal workers were forced to visit food banks or to borrow money.\n\nFederal workers will be compensated when the government reopens. But workers in the roughly 4 million private-sector jobs that depend on the federal government won't receive back pay.\n\nS&P Global Ratings estimates that the economy lost $6 billion because of the government closure \u2014 a sizable but relatively negligible sum in a $19 trillion-plus U.S. economy.\n\n\"If the shutdown had lasted much longer, the economic impacts would have snowballed \u2014 travel problems, tax refunds, etc.,\" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.\n\nStill, the damage isn't likely to lift immediately. And some federal employees had expressed anxiety during the shutdown about the stability and security of their jobs. The most skilled or talented among them may be likelier to leave government service, a potential problem for an economy already facing worker shortages in some areas.\n\nJob searches by employees at multiple federal agencies jumped during the shutdown, according to clicks tracked by the jobs site Indeed. Employees who had gone unpaid at the Department of Homeland Security, Census Bureau, the IRS and the Transportation Safety Administration were much more likely to be hunting for a new job compared with the past two years of searches.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a shortage of airport security and air traffic controllers disrupted travel at such major hubs as LaGuardia Airport in New York and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. The pressure on Mr. Trump to reopen the government intensified Friday after a delay of about 3,000 flights by mid-afternoon because six of 13 air traffic controllers didn't show up to work at a critical center in Virginia.\n\nThe FBI Agents Association warned this week that the shutdown was not only hurting individual FBI employees and their families, but hampering key operations. Some of those affected operations, according to a series of statements the association released Tuesday, included efforts to thwart the same criminal enterprises Mr. Trump claims the shutdown was meant to defeat in the long run.\n\nPresident Trump agreed to reopen the government for three weeks on Friday after having forced the shutdown in hopes of compelling Democrats to approve billions for a wall on the Mexico border. One lingering risk now is if Mr. Trump chooses to shutter the government again after the agreement lapses on February 15. Should that occur, it would sabotage consumer confidence and hurt the economy, predicted Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n\n\"It would wipe out confidence,\" Zandi said.\n\nHowever, six Republican senators voted for the failed bill to refund the government without wall money on Thursday, showing discontent in the GOP ranks. Mr. Trump has threatened to declare a national emergency if Congress does not agree to provide funding for the wall."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/frozen-cat-covered-in-ice-revived-after-being-found-in-snowbank/", "text": "A nearly-unresponsive cat who was covered in snow and \"essentially frozen,\" was revived by vets at a Montana animal clinic.

McCabe was not at the meeting.\n\n\"The president launched into several unrelated diatribes. One of those was commenting on the recent missile launches by the government of North Korea. And, essentially, the president said he did not believe that the North Koreans had the capability to hit us here with ballistic missiles in the United States. And he did not believe that because President Putin had told him they did not. President Putin had told him that the North Koreans don't actually have those missiles,\" McCabe said his colleague told him.\n\nMcCabe said U.S. intelligence officials at the briefing tried to tell the president otherwise.\n\n\"Intelligence officials in the briefing responded that that was not consistent with any of the intelligence our government possesses,\" McCabe said. \"To which the president replied, 'I don't care. I believe Putin.'\"\n\nWhen asked what he thought of the president's comments, McCabe said he was shocked.\n\n\"It's just an astounding thing to say,\" McCabe told Pelley. \"To spend the time and effort and energy that we all do in the intelligence community to produce products that will help decision-makers and the ultimate decision maker \u2014 the president of the United States \u2014 make policy decisions. And to be confronted with an absolute disbelief in those efforts and an unwillingness to learn the true state of affairs that he has to deal with every day was just shocking.\"\n\nIn the interview, McCabe also describes efforts he made to ensure FBI investigations into the president would not be ended \"were I removed quickly of reassigned or fired.\" And he also recounts discussions he said he had with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein during \"incredibly turbulent, incredibly stressful\" times after President Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/andrew-mccabe-bizarre-job-interview-with-president-donald-trump-and-other-clips/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab0g", "text": "\"It's absolutely astonishing,\" says Scott Pelley when 60 Minutes Overtime asked for his reaction to Andrew McCabe's recollections of the days just after FBI director James Comey was fired.\n\n\"Imagine the deputy attorney general talking about how to remove the president of the United States.

I said, 'I have no idea who people in the FBI voted for. It's not something that we discuss at work.'\"\n\nThe conversation also turned to McCabe's 2016 presidential vote.

McCabe says Rosenstein wanted Comey's advice\n\nIn this extra 60 Minutes clip, Andrew McCabe describes the tumultuous days after FBI director James Comey was fired. McCabe says Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein carefully weighed whether to appoint a special counsel to investigate President Trump, and it was during those deliberations that McCabe says Rosenstein made a curious request:\n\nANDREW MCCABE: He mentioned to me how highly he thought of Jim Comey. And he mentioned that he would like to speak to Jim Comey about it.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: After Comey was fired?\n\nANDREW MCCABE: That's correct.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Rosenstein had been the one who wrote the memo that got Comey fired. And now, he wants to reach out and ask him for advice?\n\nANDREW MCCABE: He did. He did. He raised the issue with me twice.\n\nWho let Comey fly on an FBI plane?\n\nAfter firing Comey, Trump calls McCabe about FBI plane use\n\nAndrew McCabe tells 60 Minutes he received his first phone call from President Trump shortly after he fired FBI director James Comey.\n\n\"He said, 'Hello, Mr. Director, this is Don Trump,'\" recalls McCabe. Then Mr. Trump demanded to know why James Comey had been allowed to fly home on an FBI airplane, says McCabe.\n\n\"It was a presidential order after 9/11 that the director of the FBI travels on a government plane because he needs to be within reach of secure communications,\" explains McCabe, \"so the director typically travels on an FBI plane, and he [Comey] had done so that day to California, which is where he was when he found out by watching the television that he'd been fired.\"\n\nOn the call, McCabe told President Trump he was the one who decided to fly Comey and his team home on the FBI plane, and Mr. Trump \"was mad about it,\" says McCabe. Then the president pressed further, McCabe tells Pelley.\n\n\"He asked if Jim Comey would be allowed back in the FBI building, if he would come into the building to collect his personal effects,\" recalls McCabe.

The social media campaign to return the girls became an international sensation, with a hashtag demanding #bringbackourgirls. Michelle Obama tweeted it, so did Malala.\n\nThe Nigerian government eventually negotiated the release of 103 girls, fewer than half of those taken. As 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl reports this week on the broadcast, most of the girls who were released now attend a school paid for by the Nigerian government and a few donors. The school is set up specifically for the girls, and it includes therapy sessions, English language lessons, and laptops connected to Wi-Fi.\n\nMany of the Chibok girls now attend a school set up specifically for them. It includes therapy sessions, English language lessons, and laptops connected to Wi-Fi.\n\nWhile the international spotlight has shined on the schoolgirls from Chibok, however, Boko Haram has also kidnapped or displaced thousands of other women and girls whose stories are seldom told.\n\n\"We have tried to stress to the press that it doesn't do any good to focus on this tiny group that have had the same experience as all these others,\" said Fatima Akilu, the executive director of the Neem Foundation, which provides pyscho-social care for victims of violence in Nigeria. \"We think you should focus on these few, but you should [also] show the others who are suffering. This is something that is going to affect a generation of girls, not just a few hundred.\"\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that Boko Haram has displaced more than 2 million people in Nigeria. The Nigerian government runs camps for internally displaced people (IDP) that house hundreds of thousands, including women who, like the Chibok girls, escaped after being kidnapped by the militant Islamic group.\n\n\"Apart from humanitarian assistance, [IDP camp residents] also need psychological trauma support,\" Akilu said. \"A lot of them have experienced repeated rapes [under Boko Haram], and some of them continue to suffer in the camps. It's not a picnic in the camps. Access to education is poor for a lot of them.\"\n\nResidents of the Malkohi camp, a government-run IDP camp just 30 minutes away from where the Chibok girls attend school\n\nA 60 Minutes team recently observed the stark disparity between the Chibok girls' lives and those living in IDP camps. Stahl, along with producers Alexandra Poolos and Kate Morris, first visited the Chibok girls at their school in Nigeria's Adamawa State, then traveled to the Malkohi camp, a small IDP camp only 30 minutes away.\n\n\"The contrast was striking and almost painful to see,\" Stahl told 60 Minutes Overtime in the video above.\n\nMany of the children in the Malkohi IDP camp do not attend school\n\nThe women 60 Minutes spoke with in the Malkohi camp said they don't have enough food to eat; the monthly rations are meager and must be shared among many. Some forage for wild leaves in the bush to supplement their diets.\n\nWoman at the Malkohi IDP camp told 60 Minutes they must forage for wild leaves to supplement their diets\n\n\"Why that's so striking is because that, eating grass, was the condition that the Chibok girls were in under Boko Haram,\" Stahl said.\n\nOne of the women in the camp, a middle-aged woman named Fatima, told 60 Minutes that she, too, had been kidnapped by Boko Haram. She said she was held for four months before escaping with the help of a Boko Haram militant, who quietly released her at the Cameroon border.\n\nFor more than four years, she has lived at Malkohi camp, where she said the conditions are awful.\n\nFatima, a resident of the Malkohi IDP camp, told 60 Minutes she had been kidnapped by Boko Haram and held for four months before escaping\n\n\"They only give two measures of rice for the whole month,\" she said. \"See how our children are really getting no soap, no nothing, no sleep mat, no lodging.\"\n\nFatima brought the 60 Minutes team into the area where she sleeps, a small room with mats on the floor that she said she shares with five others. As she began to complain about the setup, a representative with the camp interrupted her, pulled her aside, and told her not to let cameras film inside.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera last March, Bitrus Samuel, the National Emergency Management Agency's head in Abuja, said the Nigerian government says it is doing everything in its power to meet the humanitarian needs of IDPs across the country.\n\n\"IDPs issues have always been and will always be a priority for our government,\" Samuel said.\n\n60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl speaks with a young girl named Fatima, who is about the same age as the Chibok girls. Fatima said her family cannot afford for her to attend school\n\nThe 60 Minutes team saw the contrast between the Chibok girls and the women in the IDP camp most acutely with another, younger woman named Fatima, who is about the same age as those in school 30 minutes away.\n\n\"I had just come from the school, where these girls, I mean their lives are all about their future, wide open,\" Stahl said. \"And here is a girl, same age, seeing no path out for herself.\"\n\nThe younger Fatima told Stahl that Boko Haram insurgents had chased her family away from their home, and because the group is still killing people in her hometown, her family thinks it's safer to stay in the IDP camp. Fatima does not attend school; she said her family cannot afford it.\n\n\"I'm very unhappy because I'm not doing anything,\" she said. \"I don't have a job. I don't have a vocation.\"\n\nWhen Stahl asked her if she has hope for the future, she simply shook her head: \"No.\"\n\nTo watch Lesley Stahl's 60 Minutes report about the Chibok girls and their new school, click here.\n\nThe video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and Will Croxton.

Her career ended with bronze in the downhill at the world championships in Are, Sweden, making her the first female skier to win medals at six different world championships. Below is a transcript of Sharyn Alfonsi's January 2017 profile on Vonn for 60 Minutes Sports.\n\nYou probably know Lindsey Vonn as a skier or a swimsuit model or the woman who used to date Tiger Woods. But what most people don't realize is that Lindsey Vonn isn't just a skier, she's on the verge of becoming the greatest skier of all time. Vonn is chasing a nearly three-decade-old record that no skier in the world, man or woman, has come close to breaking. The only thing standing in her way is gravity. If Lindsey Vonn wants to make history, she has to stay vertical and given her recent history, that's become a pretty big if.\n\nVonn in 2017\n\nLindsay Winninger: Two more. You got it. One more.\n\nThis is the penance. The painful price an athlete must pay for demanding too much of her body.\n\nLindsay Winninger: Good?\n\nLindsey Vonn: I don't need help. Don't--\n\nLindsay Winninger: I'm not going to-- I'm not going to.\n\nLindsey Vonn: Get your hand off me. Don't touch me.\n\nLindsay Winninger: I'm not going to. Good.\n\nThere is no video of exactly what happened on Copper Mountain during a training run two months ago. But the X-rays of Lindsey Vonn's right arm look like something from a dinosaur exhibit, a complete fracture of the humerus bone, the worst injury of her spectacular career.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What the hell happened?\n\nLindsey Vonn: Yeah. I mean, unfortunately, I was just training. It was like any other normal day. And I caught my edge funny, my ski came off, I did the splits and kind of got my arm caught behind me. And I broke it.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How bad was the pain?\n\nLindsey Vonn: It was definitely, I would say, the most excruciating pain I've ever been in.\n\nVonn with correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi in 2017\n\nHer trainer, Lindsay Winninger, didn't see the crash but she sure heard what followed.\n\nLindsay Winninger: I was standing at the top and we have radios out there for-- for safety and when I got the call on the radio to come down, you could hear her screaming in the background on one of the coach's radios. So I knew that it was bad.\n\nLindsay Winninger: Check out.\n\nLindsey Vonn: What do you think I am? Think that was my first time?\n\nLindsay Winninger: What number is that? I would have said, that was 30 already.\n\nLindsey Vonn: This is not my first rodeo.\n\nLindsay Winninger: No, it's definitely not.\n\nIndeed, it is not. If one didn't know better, it might seem as if crashing is what Vonn does best.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Can you give me Lindsey Vonn's greatest hits of injuries?\n\nLindsey Vonn: The greatest hits is really just my right knee, two ACLs, MCL, meniscus, broken my risk, my thumb, my pinky, just a couple of random broken bones. But, mostly, it's-- oh, my ankle. I forget there's just a lot.\n\nLindsey Vonn competing in the women's World Cup downhill in St. Moritz, Switzerland on Jan. 24, 2015 Marco Trovati / AP\n\nThat all-or-nothing style has made Lindsey Vonn the winningest female skier in history. She's on the verge of becoming the greatest skier, male or female, of all time. With 76 World Cup victories, she's just ten short of the record held by Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark, a slalom and giant slalom skier who raced in the 1970s and '80s. Vonn has won in all five racing disciplines, and now focuses exclusively on the downhill and super-G, the highest speed events.\n\nLindsey Vonn: Fear is just not part of the equation for me. I never think about it. It's not something that enters my mind. My-- I mean, I-- of course, I weigh the risk of doing certain things but I don't fear what I'm doing, I'm just trying to be calculated in how I try to win.\n\nIn alpine skiing World Cup victories are considered more valuable than even Olympic gold. But when Vonn won the downhill gold in Vancouver in 2010, she became the first American female skier to win that event.\n\nLindsey Vonn: I remember being in the start. I remember being in the finish. But I really don't remember the run itself. I was just-- I don't know, I put everything I had into that run. And when I watch the video, I was on the limit, you know, my line was-- if I had been just a little bit here or there, I would have gone out of the course or would have lost my speed. I mean it was-- it was the most aggressive I have skied in an Olympics, especially but probably ever.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Do you remember the moment you realized that you had won when you looked up?\n\nLindsey Vonn: Yeah, when I crossed the finish line. And I saw my time and I just collapsed and screamed.\n\nLindsey Vonn celebrates her 63rd World Cup win with her team after winning a super-G in Italy on Jan. 19, 2015 Giovanni Auletta / AP\n\nBorn Lindsey Caroline Kildow in Burnsville, Minnesota, 32 years ago she was taught to ski by her father and displayed no early talent.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you win right away?\n\nLindsey Vonn: Oh, no, I was really bad.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You were bad?\n\nLindsey Vonn: I was really bad. My coach used to call me a turtle. Yeah.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: A turtle?\n\nLindsey Vonn: Yeah. And everyone made fun of my dad, because you know, he was so excited that I wanted to ski race and-- and then here he was producing this turtle of a skier.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: I heard you were like nine years old and you went to Austria, is that right, to like professionally train, so something happened between seven and nine where you went from turtle to savant.\n\nLindsey Vonn: Yeah. I mean I just saw how the Europeans were training and how dedicated and driven they were. And then I met Picabo Street when I was, that same year, when I was nine. And she really was the reason that I wanted to become an Olympian, you know, seeing her and seeing how charismatic and amazing she was. It was like that's what I want to be.\n\nWhen Vonn made the U.S. team for the first time at the age of 16 she was a nobody who wanted very much to be a somebody.\n\nLindsey Vonn: I want to be most dedicated and hardworking and decorated skier of all time.\n\nBut she says her teammates and coaches saw nothing special about her or her skiing.\n\nLindsey Vonn: I heard them talking about me sometimes, you know, in the halls of the hotel rooms and--\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Saying what?\n\nLindsey Vonn: Saying that they don't think I'm going to be anything. And it's a-- it's pretty harsh when you're, you know, sixteen, seventeen years old and that's the only dream you've ever had and you're hearing people that are supposed to support you and help you and guide you, say that they don't believe in you.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did it get you down or did it fuel you?\n\nLindsey Vonn: Oh, it fueled me. I'm the kind of person that if you tell me I can't do something, I will do everything I can to prove you wrong.\n\nShe did in 2013 after she blew out her knee. And now she has combined fanatical conditioning with a super-aggressive style to not only become the unquestioned star of the team, but one of the most recognizable athletes in the world.\n\nJust google Lindsey Vonn and what you'll see is red carpet turns, a lot of skin, and much ado about her relationship with Tiger Woods.\n\nHardly anything about her four World Cup overall titles, a fact she acknowledges with a mixture of pride and regret.\n\nLindsey Vonn: I mean, I did the swimsuit issue this last time because I felt like I was with a group of girls that was strong and successful and powerful and I felt like it sends a really good message. But I would prefer that people know me for-- as being a skier as being, you know, a very successful skier and sometimes I feel like that line gets blurred and I am known for what I do outside of skiing.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You admitted to suffering depression at one point. Can you tell me about that? What was going on?\n\nLindsey Vonn: Oh, I still-- I mean, I-- I still take meds and I am-- sometimes it's really hard and, you know, I don't want to get out of bed.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why?\n\nLindsey Vonn: I-- I don't know. I just-- like I said, I lack-- I lack self-confidence. And I-- skiing is what makes me happy. And when I don't ski, I have a hard time just being happy. The thing is, like everyone thinks that, you know, being a successful athlete is really great and everyone knows who you are, and you have all these medals and trophies and magazines and whatnot, but you come home at the end of the day and you're still alone.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You're lonely?\n\nLindsey Vonn: I am lonely. I'm really lonely. So when I don't have skiing, it's-- it's-- it's hard.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Explain to me how you don't feel confident, because you're articulate, you're successful, you can rock a bikini like nobody's business. It looks like you've got the world figured out.\n\nLindsey Vonn: Well, I'm glad you think that.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: I mean you look like the picture of confidence to me. Is that?\n\nLindsey Vonn: That's-- it's like what I want to be.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Mm-Mm.\n\nLindsey Vonn: It's not necessarily what I am. I mean, I am successful. I feel like I'm somewhat smart. I'm good at ski racing. I'm in great shape. But I'm just-- I don't know-- I have a strong feeling of just not being good enough.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: At?\n\nLindsey Vonn: Everything.\n\nShe's put out a book equating strength with beauty, part memoir, part training tips. And she's now dating Kenan Smith, an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Rams, her first public romance since dating Tiger Woods.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you hear from him after the accident?\n\nLindsey Vonn: No, I didn't. But I think, you know, he's probably just focused on coming back, you know, came back a couple of weeks ago. So I'm sure he was just focused on that.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Surprised you didn't hear from him?\n\nLindsey Vonn: A little bit.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Yeah. And you're going to leave it at that.\n\nLindsey Vonn: Yep.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Okay.\n\nAt 32 the clock is ticking. She believes she can return to the World Cup circuit later this month, praying to heaven that hell freezes over. Just weeks after the broken arm, she posted a video online, doing some foolish pull-ups, which got the attention of her trainer.\n\nLindsey Vonn: Yeah, I got in big trouble for that.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Yeah.\n\nLindsey Vonn: Oops.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And that seemed like a good idea?\n\nLindsey Vonn: Yeah.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Yeah.\n\nLindsay Winninger: I think I fired off a few texts at first and then a few phone calls and, you know, definitely I was like, what are you doing? She's like, it feels good. It feels good. I'm like, it doesn't matter, like, you're three weeks out from the surgery. The plate could shift, the screws could shift, the bone fragments could shift, like, what are you doing?\n\nHer priorities right now are competing in the 2018 Olympics in South Korea and racing and beating a top flight male skier.\n\nLindsey Vonn: There's a lot of men that don't want to see that happen. I mean I beat half of them when I train with them.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: They don't want to be embarrassed?\n\nLindsey Vonn: They don't want to be embarrassed. And I'm not going to beat all of them, I can assure you that. But I at least want a chance to see what my skiing is capable of against the best.\n\nAnd above all, winning eleven more World Cup races to break Ingemar Stenmark's Ruthian Record. The record that would make her the greatest alpine skier of all time.\n\nLindsey Vonn: It's very important. I mean I-- you know, I can try to trick myself and, you know, pretend like it doesn't mean everything to me, but it really does. And if I can break it, then I think that solidifies me, you know, in skiing and in the history of skiing. And that's something that I want. I want people to remember my accomplishments, not, you know, that I was hurt all the time, but that I won all the time."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-el-chapo-a-look-back-at-60-minutes-reports/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab0g", "text": "The story of notorious Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n has it all: dozens of murders; billions of dollars of drugs smuggled around the world; two prison escapes that made Guzm\u00e1n into something of a folklore hero.\n\nHis nickname may mean \"Shorty\" in Spanish, but his reach was long. On Tuesday, jurors found Guzm\u00e1n guilty on all 10 counts in his drug trafficking and murder trial at a federal court in New York City.\n\n60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker has been covering the almost-mythical criminal pedigree of the Mexican drug lord since he was captured in Mexico in 2014. Here are some of those reports.\n\n2014: Public Enemy Number 1 is caught\n\nWhen Mexican marines captured Guzm\u00e1n in 2014, he had been on 13-year run from the law after escaping from a Mexican prison in 2001. He was the most wanted man in the world; his international drug cartel put him at the top of the list.\n\n\"Making billions of dollars, having a reach around the world in Asia, Australia, in Africa, in Europe; putting poison on the streets, not just in the United States, but all over the world,\" Derek Maltz told Whitaker in the video above. Maltz was in charge of the DEA's Special Operations Division tasked with finding Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nAfter years of independent searching, Mexican law enforcement had teamed up with several U.S. law enforcement agencies to track the drug lord. After streamlining their efforts, the group tracked Guzm\u00e1n to a non-descript house in the midst of a middle-class Mexican neighborhood. But as soon as the Mexican marines arrived, Guzm\u00e1n escaped down a tunnel underneath his bathtub.\n\nMaltz feared the drug lord would continue evading arrest. \"I never believed that he would ever be captured,\" he said.\n\nBut the Mexican marines were relentless. With the help of American law enforcement, they tracked Guzm\u00e1n to a beachfront building in Mazatl\u00e1n, where they finally captured him and arrested him.\n\n\"We did not ever anticipate that he'd be captured alive,\" said Jim Dinkins, who was head of Homeland Security Investigations and had pursued Guzm\u00e1n for more than a decade. \"We thought he'd fight to the death.\"\n\n2015: \"El Chapo\" escapes from prison\n\nGuzm\u00e1n had already escaped from prison once. In 2015, he did it again.\n\nAlmost from the moment he was delivered to Altiplano Prison, a maximum security facility in Mexico, a construction crew from his Sinaloa cartel began digging a tunnel to free him. From almost a mile away, Guzm\u00e1n's men dug down about three stories and then burrowed 4,921 feet straight toward Altiplano. The tunnel went under the prison wall and beneath the plumbing \u2014 and with remarkable accuracy, emerged straight into Guzm\u00e1n's shower stall.\n\n\"It's very difficult to navigate underground,\" Dinkins said. \"This tunnel, I believe, went from point A to point B with only minor deviations, if any. And that is an engineering marvel in and of itself.\"\n\nDEA Chief Chuck Rosenberg told Whitaker how he thought it might be possible: corruption and bribes within Mexican law enforcement.\n\n\"I don't know specifically how high up they reach,\" Rosenberg said. \"My sense is that they're both broad and deep, that they go throughout the Mexican government.\"\n\nJoe DiMeglio, the chief of the San Diego Tunnel Task Force, told Whitaker that he wasn't sure Guzm\u00e1n would ever be caught again.\n\n2015: The greatest escape\n\n2016: Recapturing \"El Chapo\"\n\nBut unlike the first time Guzm\u00e1n escaped from prison, he became sloppy the second time around. After his daring breakout in 2015, the drug lord seemed to become almost delusional.\n\n\"He became drunk on his own wine,\" said Peter Vincent, a senior official and legal adviser of both the Justice Department and Homeland Security during the international manhunt for Guzm\u00e1n. \"He started to believe the hype that he was special, that he was almost a demigod, that he was something truly magical. And he became so incredibly arrogant that he thought he was untouchable.\"\n\nHe wasn't. Only 20 days after his escape, the Mexican marines had picked up on Guzm\u00e1n's trail.\n\nIntelligence tracked him to a house in the coastal town of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. Wiretap intercepts picked up on a visit planned by \"grandma and aunt\"\u2014code names for Guzm\u00e1n and his lieutenant. Then, \"grandma\" finally showed up. As an assault force moved into position, an armored truck left to go pick up food for a party.\n\n\"For an incredibly savvy, clever, almost a criminal genius that El Chapo Guzm\u00e1n was, he ultimately was done in by very simple tastes: tacos, tequila, and chicas,\" Vincent said.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n was arrested again. Mexican federal police took him to a motel instead of jail \u2014 a move Vincent said indicates that Guzm\u00e1n had likely threatened his captors. But the Mexican marines appeared and apprehended Guzm\u00e1n for a last time, flying him to Mexico City for booking.\n\nThe trial began in November, and jurors deliberated for more than 30 hours over six days before reaching their verdict.

At that time, Zuckerberg was just 23 years old and Facebook had 60 million users. Since then, Zuckerberg has watched the social network he created in his Harvard dorm room amass over 2 billion users, impact presidential elections and spark privacy and data-sharing concerns. The following is a transcript from Stahl's 2008 story.\n\nAre you on Facebook yet? The site is up to 60 million users so far, with a projection of 200 million by the end of the year. If you're not on Facebook, here's how it works: you set up a profile page with details about yourself and then decide who gets to see it. Friends use their pages to share personal news, exchange photos, team up on political causes, or just play long-distance Scrabble. It can be a useful tool or an addictive waste of time. Either way, Facebook is having a dramatic impact on the World Wide Web and it's estimated to be worth $15 billion. Sitting atop this growing company, directing an Internet revolution is a young, geeky computer programmer who created the site only four years ago.\n\nThis is the face of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, the mogul who's guiding its extraordinary growth. What everyone wants to know is, is he old enough to be running a company some people say is the biggest thing since Google.\n\nLesley Stahl: Tell everyone how old you are.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: I'm 23 right now. So that...\n\nLesley Stahl: And you're running this huge company.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: It's not that big.\n\nLesley Stahl: You're 23!\n\nAnd here he was helping me set up my own Facebook page with a profile of my likes and dislikes.\n\nLesley Stahl: Guess what my favorite TV show is.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: I can't.\n\nLesley Stahl: All right. Put 60 Minutes there.\n\nNext, we added my friends, family--that's my son-in-law--old classmates. Within a few minutes, I got a friend request.\n\nLesley Stahl: Here's a guy I haven't talked to in two years, and I'm so thrilled to hear from him. Mark...\n\nThis is why so many find the site addictive. In a world with no cell phone or e-mail directories, Facebook has become a way to find lost friends.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: It used to be the case, like, you'd switch jobs, and then maybe you wouldn't keep in touch with all the people that you knew from that old job.\n\nLesley Stahl: Right.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Just because it was too hard. But one of the things that Facebook does is it makes it really easy to just stay in touch with all these people.\n\nOf course, if someone tries to friend you, you can ignore them. And privacy settings allow you to deny access to your page, say to your boss or your parents.\n\nGood afternoon, Facebook. How may I help you?\n\nFacebook headquarters in downtown Palo Alto looks like a dorm room. The 400 employees, who get free food and laundry, show up late, stay late, and party really late. Zuckerberg, who's made the cover of Newsweek and is reportedly worth $3 billion, sits at a desk like the other software engineers writing computer code.\n\nLesley Stahl: Have you changed your lifestyle? You don't look like you're buying really expensive clothes?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: No, I'm not buying really expensive clothes. No.\n\nLesley Stahl: Are you buying things? Are you buying things that you would...\n\nMark Zuckerberg: No. I have a little like one-bedroom apartment with a mattress on the floor. That's where I live.\n\nLesley Stahl: It's almost like a Disney movie.\n\nKara Swisher: Right.\n\nLesley Stahl: Twenty-three-year-old kid takes over major company.\n\nKara Swisher: Right. Right.\n\nKara Swisher, who used to write about Silicon Valley for The Wall Street Journal and now has a blog, \"All Things Digital,\" has called him \"The Toddler CEO.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: What do you think it's done to him as a person, to be 23 years old...\n\nKara Swisher: I think it's hard. I think when all of a sudden you're the smartest person in the world and you're the meal ticket for everybody, and this is the big hit. This is the new--this is the new Google at this point. And so Mark is under a lot of pressure because everybody wants something from him.\n\nLike the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg is looked up to in Silicon Valley as a visionary.\n\nLesley Stahl: You seem to be replacing Larry and Sergey as the people out here who everyone's talking about. You're just staring at me.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Is that a question?\n\nWe were warned that he can be awkward and reluctant to talk about himself. So we turned for help to his Facebook page, which says he's a Harvard alum.\n\nLesley Stahl: You're not a Harvard alum.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: That's true. We don't have a setting for dropout. No.\n\n\"I think because politicians can communicate with tens of thousands of people at the same time, it's pretty effective for them in campaigning.\"\n\nHe dropped out of Harvard in 2004 where he was intending to study psychology. His mom is a psychiatrist. Here she is on Facebook. His dad's a dentist. Mark was a computer whiz early on, writing software in sixth grade. In his second year at Harvard, he built a site where students could rate or berate the looks of classmates through ID photos he lifted off Harvard's computers.\n\nLesley Stahl: You got into deep trouble from this little prank.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah, well, Harvard was just not happy that I was using their images and...\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, well they said you hacked...\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Mm-hmm.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did they punish you?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah, I was put on some sort of--I don't know what you call it.\n\nLesley Stahl: Probation?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Sure.\n\nSoon thereafter, he and his two roommates created an online version of the Harvard student directory where kids could message each other. They called it \"The Facebook\" and launched it from their dorm room. Within four months, they had expanded to 40 colleges, and over the summer, moved to Palo Alto. But Mark had done code writing for some upperclassmen with a similar idea and they have filed a lawsuit.\n\nLesley Stahl: Three Harvard students are suing you, claiming that you stole their idea for Facebook.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Well, I mean, we knew that we didn't steal any ideas or code, so we're just kind of waiting until that comes out in court.\n\nLesley Stahl: In the lawsuit, they claim that you were duplicitous. Are you worried about it?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: No, I don't really spend a whole lot of my time worrying about that. I mean, we have lawyers at the company who deal with that stuff. And it's just--it's not a huge concern. I mean, probably about half my time is spent on business operation type stuff.\n\nDespite his young age, Zuckerberg seems to have made one savvy business decision after the next. He expanded access to Facebook from college students to high schoolers. Then in 2006, to adults, his fastest growing demographic. Now he's inviting everyone on the site to create new software and pocket the profits themselves. It's a way to keep the next big thing on Facebook. New programs emerge daily like Facebook Scrabble.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: I actually have a couple games going on now with my grandparents. So they got on Facebook, and we started playing Scrabble together.\n\nSo Facebook is changing the way we communicate with our friends and with our grandparents. It's also changing politics. Every major candidate has a page. Zuckerberg says there seem to be more Republicans on the site than Democrats. And among them, Barack Obama with his young persons following, is hugely popular. Hillary Clinton is hugely unpopular.\n\nLesley Stahl: You know, it used to be, first, you went on \"Face the Nation\" if you were a candidate; then well, no, you went on \"Letterman.\" Now it seems the candidates have to be on Facebook. Are you changing the way candidates are running for president?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Well, I think because politicians can communicate with tens of thousands of people at the same time, it's pretty effective for them in campaigning.\n\nFacebook is growing so quickly, there's talk of it becoming a giant-slayer.\n\nLesley Stahl: Is Facebook a challenge to Google?\n\nCharlene Li: I think they are.\n\nCharlene Li, an analyst at Forrester Research, a technology consulting company, says Facebook is a threat to Google because it could become the first site people go to to search. Say you want information about a family vacation in Maui. Li says when you check Google, you could get a list of almost 200,000 hits.\n\nCharlene Li: Versus I can go on Facebook, I can go and ask my friends, and people will write back to me, 'Oh, I've done things, and this is what I recommend, and, knowing you and your kids, they will really like doing this.' So, the next time I do something very specific like that, chances are I'll probably go to Facebook.\n\nWhich is why Yahoo! offered by buy Facebook in 2006 for $1 billion in cash. Zuckerberg declined. But then Microsoft swooped in and bought 1.6 percent of the company for $240 million. That meant that Bill Gates valued Facebook at $15 billion, roughly the same as Ford or CBS. Some analysts say that's wildly unrealistic, since Facebook has yet to figure out how to make money off its huge audience.\n\nLesley Stahl: Is it true that you don't make that much money?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: I think that's a pretty relative thing. But, I mean, as a private company, we just have the advantage of not necessarily having to report to the outside world all of our financials.\n\nHe may duck the question, but there's no getting around the fact that Facebook needs to find a way to generate revenue. And so Zuckerberg is experimenting with ads, trying to cash in on his users' own recommendations. Say you write on Facebook that you like a certain movie. That's turned into an ad. Or maybe you like a scarf from Bloomingdale's.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: So this isn't an ad that's going to go to a lot of people. Basically, when you put that information in your profile that you bought a scarf and that you like that scarf, or that's something that your friends might find interesting, right? So, what we'd do is we might show that information to your friends a little bit more proactively as an ad. Right? So...\n\nLesley Stahl: But with me in the ad?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah, but that would basically be the ad.\n\nLesley Stahl: OK, but it's almost like an endorsement, like Michael Jordan for Nike. I become the spokesman for that ad.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Well, that's what you're doing when you're putting that information in your profile.\n\nThe real trouble started when they began using a tracking program called Beacon that monitors what you buy on over 40 websites and automatically reports it to your friends, without explicit permission.\n\nLesley Stahl: People signed up for Facebook thinking that it was a way to just stay in touch with their friends. And now some of them feel that there's some snooping going on. Is there any concern you're turning Facebook into something much more commercial?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: I actually think that this makes it less commercial. I mean, what would you rather see, a banner ad from Bloomingdale's or that one of your friends bought a scarf?\n\nBut when a Facebook user bought his wife a diamond ring online, the surprise was ruined because Beacon notified all his friends, and his wife, about it on Facebook. With stories like that, criticism of Beacon began to build. But Zuckerberg dug in his heels until he had a full blown PR disaster on his hands, including petitions and bloggers writing obituaries.\n\nLesley Stahl: Well, I guess this shows how difficult it is for a company like yours to make money through advertising and protect people's real privacy and their sense of privacy.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: You know, it might take some work for us to get this exactly right. This is something that we think is going to be a really good thing.\n\nNot a real answer to the privacy question, more like the canned response of a typical business executive.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: There have to be ads either way because we have to make money. I mean, we have 400 employees and, you know, I mean, we have to support all that and make a profit.\n\nBut three big advertisers threatened to pull out, and Zuckerberg was forced to relent. He agreed to amend Beacon, making it easier for users to turn it off. And he apologized.\n\nLesley Stahl: So do you think that Mark failed as a leader in the Beacon...\n\nKara Swisher: Absolutely.\n\nLesley Stahl: ...fiasco or what you want to call it?\n\nKara Swisher: Yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: What were his mistakes?\n\nKara Swisher: His mistake was doing it.\n\nLesley Stahl: Doing it?\n\nKara Swisher: Doing it, period. His mistake was not explaining it to people. His mistake was not backing off very quickly when it was clear that it was a problem. I just feel like you see some of these mistakes they're making very early on, and you worry where the judgment is. Now...\n\nLesley Stahl: Is he a good CEO?\n\nKara Swisher: I don't know. I think he's very young.\n\nBut those around Zuckerberg say he is learning fast. He might still wear a hoodie and no socks, but he's becoming a suit, as he ponders whether to take his company public this year.\n\nLesley Stahl: This would be a good place to announce that.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: I think what I can announce is that it is highly unlikely that we will go public in 2008. When going public makes sense to do, we'll do that, and maybe that's two years out, maybe it is three years out.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think that your age is an asset or a liability?\n\nMark Zuckerberg: I mean, there's probably a little bit of both, right? I mean, there are definitely elements of experience and stuff that someone who's my age wouldn't have. But there are also things that I can do that other people wouldn't necessarily be able to."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-commercial-satellites-be-used-for-espionage-60-minutes/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab0g", "text": "For decades, the U.S. has relied on spy satellites to look deep into the territory of American adversaries, and for years, these were the cameras dominating Earth's orbit.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nAs David Martin reports on 60 Minutes this week, there are now commercial companies putting small satellites in space and allowing customers to purchase panoramic images of Earth. As a result, the U.S. government no longer holds a monopoly on the photos taken from orbit\u2014and has no power to classify commercial images as top secret.\n\nOne of those companies, Planet Labs, has put about 300 satellites into orbit, enough to image the entire landmass of Earth every day. The company has done it, in part, by reducing the dimension of its satellites. Government satellites are the size of a pickup truck; Planet Labs' are the size of a loaf of bread.\n\nPlanet Labs' commercial satellites are no bigger than a loaf of bread. For comparison, government satellites are about the size of a pickup truck.\n\nThe U.S. government sets limits on commercial satellite use and mandates that American companies obtain a license. It also restricts the optical resolution of satellites; commercial cameras are not allowed to zoom down to the same detail as a spy satellite.\n\nStill, the resolution comes relatively close. Martin told 60 Minutes Overtime that U.S. military officers could use commercial satellites for 90 percent of the intelligence they need.\n\nThese new satellites make close monitoring\u2014if not outright espionage\u2014an option, particularly for governments that do not have their own advanced satellite technology. The first spy photos that American satellites took of the former Soviet Union were not as high quality as the photos that Planet Labs is now taking.\n\nThe National Geospatial Intelligence Agency even uses Planet Labs images to get a more complete look at the world, particularly in places where U.S. spy satellites are not focused.\n\nThe humanitarian uses for commercial satellite images are numerous. Planet Labs' photographs monitor change, creating before-and-after pictures of environmental transformations, such as deforestation, receding glaciers, and melting ice caps.\n\nPlanet Labs\n\nPlanet Labs\n\nSatellite images captured by Planet Labs Planet Labs\n\nBut there is also plenty of potential for people to use commercial images in nefarious ways.\n\nFor example, people with access to satellite images could keep a daily record of the number of U.S. Navy ships in port. \"If the United States were trying to move an army, as they did in the first Persian Gulf War,\" Martin said, \"move an army without the enemy seeing it, the satellite would see it.\"\n\nAnyone who obtained the images would also see an army on the move. Dictators wanting to cleanse an ethnicity would similarly be able to track movements of refugees, Martin said.\n\nSatellite images captured by Planet Labs\n\nHow, then, do commercial companies prevent their images from falling into the wrong hands? Will Marshall, a Planet Labs co-founder, told Martin his company hired an ethics officer to monitor this specific question.\n\n\"We have a process to review every single new client on a case-by-case basis,\" Marshall said. \"Is it in line with our values?\"\n\nU.S. sanctions prohibit companies like Planet Labs from selling to countries like North Korea or Russia. But, Martin said, that's what front companies are for.\n\n\"You can, I think, rely on Planet to operate in good faith,\" Martin said. \"Whether or not they can be fooled is another question.\"\n\nTo watch David Martin's 60 Minutes report on small satellites, click here.\n\nThe video above was produced by Will Croxton and Brit McCandless Farmer.

But today, as one of the most successful venture capitalists in the field of artificial intelligence, Lee has decided that best place to be an AI capitalist is in communist China.\n\nLee's firm, Sinovation Ventures, has funded 140 AI startups, including shared-bicycle companies, education companies, and a firm that's developing dishwashing robots. Lee says that the future for AI companies in China offers more promise than anywhere else, because of the simple fact that in a country of 1.4 billion, there's just more data than anywhere else. In China, data has become its own kind of abundant natural resource.\n\nLee has called China \"the Saudi Arabia of data.\"\n\n\"People are ordering takeout 10 times more than the U.S. They're doing mobile payment 50 times more than the U.S. They're ordering shared bicycles 300 times more than the U.S.,\" Lee says in the clip above. \"And all that data can be fed into an engine to make money as well as to improve user experience.\"\n\nNot only is there more data, Lee says, but in China there's a different expectation of privacy than in a Western democracy such as the U.S.\n\n\"Chinese users are not scrutinizing protection of privacy as much as the American users,\" he says. \"I think some of it is cultural. Some of it is due to the fact that China grew up in technology, whereas Americans have been using technology for a long time.\"\n\nWhat data does China have on its citizens?\n\nBut that raises an immediate question: In a country run by a centralized, one-party, authoritarian government, does handing over so much information about its citizens give the Communist party incredible control over its people?\n\nLee says that it's not that simple.\n\n\"Theoretically, all the data goes through servers that are managed by Chinese telecom companies,\" he says in the clip above. \"But that total amount of data is both too large and too raw to be useful for artificial intelligence. The potential accessibility is there. But I do not think right now anyone in the Chinese government is mining the massive data in the internet or commerce. It's just too big.\"\n\nLee was educated in the U.S., first as a teenager in Tennessee, then at Columbia University, and later at Carnegie Mellon. But when it comes to the idea of \"Big Brother,\" he believes China and the U.S. aren't as different as one might think.\n\nLee points out that the American government can already access all the transactions in Visa or MasterCard for tax purposes. \"So I think we're talking about maybe a matter of degree, not that there is something unique about China that the U.S. doesn't have,\" he says.\n\nInstead, Lee suggests that the course of history\u2014 following the long trajectory of where technology is taking us \u2014 will leave citizens living in a world that generally offers far less privacy than before.\n\n\"I think left unchecked, all companies will attempt to get more data and use it for their ability to profit,\" Lee says. \"And all governments are going to want to get more data to understand the citizen behaviors, to protect them and to make sure they don't evade taxes, or do something that's criminal.

The movie is up for 10 awards, including nominations for best director and original screenplay for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, a celebrated director known for critically acclaimed films like \"Gravity\", \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" and \"Children of Men.\"\n\nHe took a deeply personal and semi-autobiographical approach to \"Roma,\" looking back at his youth in Mexico City where he was raised by a single mother and their selfless housekeeper. When Cuar\u00f3n's father left, his family struggled to remain whole. He channeled those emotions into the film.\n\n\"It was not necessarily a pleasant period in my life and maybe it's a period that created fears that lasted for many years,\" he told CBS News' Jamie Yuccas. \"I think the core of it is pretty universal because at the end, the film deals with this shared experience of loneliness \u2026 but only the bonds of affection, they give meaning to that loneliness.\"\n\nCuar\u00f3n admits he was caught off-guard when his highly personal project went mainstream.\n\n\"What was really surprising was the overwhelming response, emotional response when we start showing the film around in different countries all around the world, gave me hope, that at the end we are the same,\" he said.\n\nYalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira in \"Roma\" Netflix\n\nThat universal truth has led to \"Roma\" being showered with awards, including two Golden Globes. At a time when President Trump frequently calls Mexican immigrants criminals as he pushes for a wall at the southern border, Cuar\u00f3n hopes his film is a reminder that they are people, too.\n\n\"When you have all this rhetoric of talking about Mexicans as rapists and dangerous and all of that stuff, you have an experience that, 'Hey, it's people. It's people like you and me.' \u2026 And we share the same dreams and we share the same need for love,\" he said.\n\nCuar\u00f3n is already well known for blockbusters like 2004's \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" which grossed $800 million worldwide. He's also recognized for pushing boundaries like when he stranded Sandra Bullock in space for the 2013 thriller \"Gravity,\" an effort that made him the first Latino director to win an Oscar.\n\nOn screen, a bond is forged between Sofia, the single mother played by Marina de Tavira and Yalitza Aparicio's character, Cleo the housekeeper. Together they find strength to cope with the shame and pain of being abandoned by men. Both have received Oscar nominations for their roles.\n\nCuar\u00f3n auditioned nearly 3,000 women before casting Aparicio as Cleo, who had no acting experience, and dedicated the film to Libo Rodriguez, the servant who raised him and remains his friend. When he sees billboards for the movie, he can't help but see her in Cleo.\n\n\"I was trying to deal with the wounds in the film, Cleo's wounds, the family wounds,\" he said.\n\nThe film is also getting a lot of love in Roma, the Mexico City suburb where it was shot. They're planning to throw a huge party the night of the Oscars.\n\n\"Well, it's Mexico. Anything is an excuse for a party!

Hard-scrabble farmers and villagers sing old songs of broken hearts, sounding as if they'd been dug from the soil. Wiktor, a music anthropologist, eagerly records them, hoping to document an authentic, timeless sound.\n\nHolding auditions for parts in his new troupe that will perform folk songs and dances, he spots a comely young blonde, Zula. She may not have the best vocal range of those trying out, but she sure has something \u2013 it's evident in the curl of her lips, her tussles of hair, her languorous movements. There is also an air of mystery about her \u2013 did she actually kill her father, as some reports suggest?\n\nTomasz Kot and Joanna Kulig in \"Cold War.\" Lukasz Bak/Amazon\n\nSo begins \"Cold War,\" a new film from director Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski, whose last picture, \"Ida,\" won the Oscar in 2015 for Best Foreign Language Film. In that movie, a young novitiate who learns she is actually Jewish leaves her convent to investigate the fate of her family. In a most memorable scene, she removes her shoes, and her nun's habit, and dances with a young man in a jazz club. Music becomes a doorway to other possibilities in life. Music serves a similar function in \"Cold War,\" as a way to survive the suffocating effects of Soviet oppression \u2013 or as a means of escape.\n\nAs Wiktor's folk troupe tours Eastern Europe, including East Berlin, the dissatisfactions he experiences over the political strait-jacket being tightened around his creativity draw him to look to the West, and to bringing Zula with him.\n\nBut their relationship, while passionate, is hardly straightforward. Zula is flighty, given to drink, and when she explodes on the dance floor, gyrating to Bill Haley and His Comets' \"Rock Around the Clock,\" she pours herself into the arms of any nearby dance partner. Despite Wiktor's invitation to cross the border with him, she does not. And so begins a long-distance attachment that transcends politics, musical genres, and their own mismatched temperaments.\n\nThe story was inspired by the director's parents, who got together, split up, married other people, then got back together; it seems they couldn't bear to be together, or apart. Wiktor and Zula have a similar push-pull, and even when we see them sharing a bed with someone else, we know that must be a temporary refrain. The life force that attracts the two of them is indomitable.\n\nJoanna Kulig in \"Cold War.\" Amazon Studios\n\nWinner of the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and Poland's entry for this year's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, \"Cold War\" is one of the year's best movies, even despite a third act that is more muted than this fiery couple would suggest is in their cards.\n\nPawlikowski has a gift for letting the camera capture the intimacy of moments regardless of crowd size. The film is elegantly shot in stunning black-and-white by cinematographer \u0141ukasz \u017bal, producing inky chasms of darkness in which the characters' electric attraction shines.\n\nJoanna Kulig is mesmerizing as Zula, wielding the sultry looks and sounds of a chanteuse with an untamable spirit that awakens Wiktor, played by Tomasz Kot. Despite escaping the East, Wiktor is a tragic figure. One can tell part of him was left behind the Iron Curtain, and that aching hole he carries with him delivers a striking lesson: Art and artistic expression may not cure every malady, even a wrongfully chosen love affair, no matter how valiantly pursued.\n\n\"Cold War\" (distributed by Amazon Studios) opens in theatres on Friday in selected cities. In Polish, German and French with English subtitles. The film is not rated, but contains nudity and sexual situations. 90 minutes.\n\nTo watch a trailer for \"Cold War\" click on the video player below."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/the-oscars/2/", "text": "Willem Dafoe: Actually painting was the key to unlocking Van Gogh for \u201cAt Eternity\u2019s Gate\u201d\n\nWith more than 100 credits to his name, actor Willem Dafoe is known for his versatility.

And suddenly, our devices have opened their eyes and ears and cars have taken the wheel. Today, artificial intelligence is not as good as you hope and not as bad as you fear, but humanity is accelerating into a future that few can predict. That's why so many people are desperate to meet Kai-Fu Lee, the oracle of AI.\n\nKai-Fu Lee is in there, somewhere, in a selfie scrum at a Beijing Internet Conference. His 50 million social media followers want to be seen in the same frame because of his talent for engineering and genius for wealth.\n\nScott Pelley: I wonder, do you think people around the world have any idea what's coming in artificial intelligence?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: I think most people have no idea, and many people have the wrong idea.\n\nScott Pelley: But you do believe it's going to change the world?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: I believe it's going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.\n\nLee believes the best place to be an AI capitalist is communist China. His Beijing venture capital firm manufactures billionaires.\n\nKai-Fu Lee in a scrum of selfie seekers\n\nKai-Fu Lee: These are the entrepreneurs that we have funded.\n\nHe's funded 140 AI start-ups.\n\nKai-Fu Lee: We have about ten billion-dollar-companies here.\n\nScott Pelley: Ten, $1 billion-companies that you funded?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: Yes, including a few $10 billion-companies.\n\nIn 2017, China attracted half of all AI capital in the world. One of Lee's investments is Face++, not affiliated with Facebook. Its visual recognition system smothered me to guess my age. It settled on 61 which was wrong. I wouldn't be 61 for days. On the street, Face++ nailed everything that moved. It's a kind of artificial intelligence that has been made possible by three innovations: super fast computer chips, all the world's data now available online, and a revolution in programming called \"deep learning.\" Computers used to be given rigid instructions. Now they're programmed to learn on their own.\n\nKai-Fu Lee: In early days of AI, people try to program the AI with how people think. So, I would write a program to say, \"Measure the size of the eyes and their distance. Measure the size of the nose. Measure the shape of the face. And then, if these things match, then this is Larry and that's John.\" But today, you just take all the pictures of Larry and John and you tell the system, \"Go at it. You figure out what separates Larry from John.\"\n\nLet's say you want the computer to be able to pick men out of a crowd and describe their clothing? Well, you simply show the computer ten million pictures of men in various kinds of dress. That's what they mean by deep learning. It's not intelligence so much. It's just the brute force of data having ten million examples to choose from.\n\nSo, Face++ tagged me as male, short hair, black long sleeves, black long pants. It's wrong about my gray suit and this is exactly how it learns. When engineers discover that error, they'll show the computer a million gray suits and it won't make that mistake again.\n\nAnother recognition system we saw, or saw us, is learning not just who you are but how you feel.\n\nScott Pelley: Now what are all the dots on the screen? The dots over our eyes and our mouths?\n\nSongfan Yang: The computer keeps track of all the feature points on the face.\n\nSongfan Yang developed this for TAL Education Group, which tutors 5 million Chinese students.\n\nScott Pelley: Well let's look at what we are seeing here now. According to the computer, I'm confused, which is generally the case. But when I laughed I was happy. That's amazing.\n\nSongfan Yang: Exactly.\n\nThe machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher those students who are struggling or gifted.\n\nScott Pelley: It can tell when the child is excited about math?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: Yes.\n\nScott Pelley: Or the other child is excited about poetry?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: Yes.\n\nScott Pelley: Could these AI systems pick out geniuses from the countryside?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: That's possible in the future. It can also create a student profile and know where the student got stuck so the teacher can personalize the areas in which the student needs help.\n\n\"AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.\"\n\nWe found Kai-Fu Lee's personal passion in this spare Beijing studio. He's projecting top teachers into China's poorest schools. This English teacher is connected to a class 1,000 miles away in a village called Duh-Fang.\n\nMany students in Duh-Fang are called 'left behinds' because their parents left them with family when they moved to the cities for work. Most 'left behinds' don't get past ninth grade. Lee is counting on AI to deliver for them the same opportunity he had when he immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a boy.\n\nKai-Fu Lee: When I arrived in Tennessee, my principal took every lunch to teach me English. And that is the kind of attention that I've not been used to growing up in Asia. And I felt that the American classrooms are smaller, encouraged individual thinking, critical thinking. And I felt it was the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\nAnd, 'the best thing that ever happened' to most of the engineers we met at Lee's firm \u2013 they too are alumni of America \u2013 with a dream for China.\n\nScott Pelley: You have written that Silicon Valley's edge is not all it's cracked up to be. What do you mean by that?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: Well, Silicon Valley has been the single epicenter of the world technology innovation when it comes to computers, internet, mobile and AI. But in the recent five years, we are seeing that Chinese AI is getting to be almost as good as Silicon Valley AI. And I think Silicon Valley is not quite aware of it yet.\n\nChina's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. The more data, the better the AI. Just like the more you know, the smarter you are. China has four times more people than the United States who are doing nearly everything online.\n\nScott Pelley: I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their hand.\n\nCollege student Monica Sun showed us how more than a billion chinese are using their phones to buy everything, find anything and connect with everyone. In America, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings. Not in China.\n\nScott Pelley: Do you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with?\n\nMonica Sun: I never think about it.\n\nScott Pelley: Do you think most Chinese worry about their privacy?\n\nMonica Sun: Not that much.\n\nScott Pelley: Not that much.\n\nWith a pliant public, the leader of the Communist Party has made a national priority of achieving AI dominance in ten years. This is where Kai-Fu Lee becomes uncharacteristically shy. Even though he's a former Apple, Microsoft and Google executive, he knows who's boss in China.\n\nWhy China is the \"Saudi Arabia\" of data\n\nScott Pelley: President Xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. What does he mean by that?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: I am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts. I don't know.\n\nScott Pelley: There are those, particularly people in the west who worry about this AI technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dissent.\n\nKai-Fu Lee: As a venture capitalist, we don't invest in this area, and we're not studying deeply this particular problem.\n\nScott Pelley: But governments do.\n\nKai-Fu Lee: It's certainly possible for governments to use the technologies, just like companies.\n\nLee is much more talkative about another threat posed by AI. He explores the coming destruction of jobs in a new book, \"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.\"\n\nKai-Fu Lee: AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.\n\nScott Pelley: What sort of jobs would be lost to AI?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: Basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40 percent of the jobs in the world.\n\nScott Pelley: Forty percent of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: I would say displaceable.\n\nScott Pelley: What does that do to the fabric of society?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: Well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions. The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. And we've gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions.\n\nWhat data does China have on its citizens?\n\nThere's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence, and it's important to understand this is not general intelligence like that of a human. This system can read faces and grade papers but it has no idea why these children are in this room or what the goal of education is. A typical AI system can do one thing well, but can't adapt what it knows to any other task. So for now, it may be that calling this \"intelligence,\" isn't very smart.\n\nScott Pelley: When will we know that a machine can actually think like a human?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: Back when I was a grad student, people said, \"If machine can drive a car by itself, that's intelligence.\" Now we say that's not enough. So, the bar keeps moving higher. I think that's, I guess, more motivation for us to work harder. But if you're talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence, I would say not within the next 30 years, and possibly never.\n\nScott Pelley: Possibly never? What's so insurmountable?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: Because I believe in the sanctity of our soul. I believe there is a lot of things about us that we don't understand. I believe there's a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computation algorithms. And I currently see no way of solving them. Obviously, unsolved problems have been solved in the past. But it would be irresponsible for me to predict that these will be solved by a certain timeframe.\n\nScott Pelley: We may just be more than our bits?\n\nKai-Fu Lee: We may.\n\nProduced by Guy Campanile and Andrew Bast"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/after-firing-fbi-director-james-comey-president-trump-calls-andrew-mccabe-about-fbi-plane-use-60-minutes/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/pope-francis-calls-for-action-at-catholic-summit-on-sex-abuse/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/andrew-mccabe-bizarre-job-interview-with-president-donald-trump-and-other-clips/", "text": "\"It's absolutely astonishing,\" says Scott Pelley when 60 Minutes Overtime asked for his reaction to Andrew McCabe's recollections of the days just after FBI director James Comey was fired.\n\n\"Imagine the deputy attorney general talking about how to remove the president of the United States. One of the investigations that McCabe started is a counterintelligence investigation. In other words, is the president of the United States an agent of Russia?

I said, 'I have no idea who people in the FBI voted for. It's not something that we discuss at work.'\"\n\nThe conversation also turned to McCabe's 2016 presidential vote. Hear him tell it, above, in an extra clip from the 60 Minutes' interview.\n\nRosenstein wanted advice from Comey?\n\nCalling Comey? McCabe says Rosenstein wanted Comey's advice\n\nIn this extra 60 Minutes clip, Andrew McCabe describes the tumultuous days after FBI director James Comey was fired. McCabe says Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein carefully weighed whether to appoint a special counsel to investigate President Trump, and it was during those deliberations that McCabe says Rosenstein made a curious request:\n\nANDREW MCCABE: He mentioned to me how highly he thought of Jim Comey. And he mentioned that he would like to speak to Jim Comey about it.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: After Comey was fired?\n\nANDREW MCCABE: That's correct.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Rosenstein had been the one who wrote the memo that got Comey fired. And now, he wants to reach out and ask him for advice?\n\nANDREW MCCABE: He did. He did. He raised the issue with me twice.\n\nWho let Comey fly on an FBI plane?\n\nAfter firing Comey, Trump calls McCabe about FBI plane use\n\nAndrew McCabe tells 60 Minutes he received his first phone call from President Trump shortly after he fired FBI director James Comey.\n\n\"He said, 'Hello, Mr. Director, this is Don Trump,'\" recalls McCabe. Then Mr. Trump demanded to know why James Comey had been allowed to fly home on an FBI airplane, says McCabe.\n\n\"It was a presidential order after 9/11 that the director of the FBI travels on a government plane because he needs to be within reach of secure communications,\" explains McCabe, \"so the director typically travels on an FBI plane, and he [Comey] had done so that day to California, which is where he was when he found out by watching the television that he'd been fired.\"\n\nOn the call, McCabe told President Trump he was the one who decided to fly Comey and his team home on the FBI plane, and Mr. Trump \"was mad about it,\" says McCabe. Then the president pressed further, McCabe tells Pelley.\n\n\"He asked if Jim Comey would be allowed back in the FBI building, if he would come into the building to collect his personal effects,\" recalls McCabe.

The social media campaign to return the girls became an international sensation, with a hashtag demanding #bringbackourgirls. Michelle Obama tweeted it, so did Malala.\n\nThe Nigerian government eventually negotiated the release of 103 girls, fewer than half of those taken. As 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl reports this week on the broadcast, most of the girls who were released now attend a school paid for by the Nigerian government and a few donors. The school is set up specifically for the girls, and it includes therapy sessions, English language lessons, and laptops connected to Wi-Fi.\n\nMany of the Chibok girls now attend a school set up specifically for them. It includes therapy sessions, English language lessons, and laptops connected to Wi-Fi.\n\nWhile the international spotlight has shined on the schoolgirls from Chibok, however, Boko Haram has also kidnapped or displaced thousands of other women and girls whose stories are seldom told.\n\n\"We have tried to stress to the press that it doesn't do any good to focus on this tiny group that have had the same experience as all these others,\" said Fatima Akilu, the executive director of the Neem Foundation, which provides pyscho-social care for victims of violence in Nigeria. \"We think you should focus on these few, but you should [also] show the others who are suffering. This is something that is going to affect a generation of girls, not just a few hundred.\"\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that Boko Haram has displaced more than 2 million people in Nigeria. The Nigerian government runs camps for internally displaced people (IDP) that house hundreds of thousands, including women who, like the Chibok girls, escaped after being kidnapped by the militant Islamic group.\n\n\"Apart from humanitarian assistance, [IDP camp residents] also need psychological trauma support,\" Akilu said. \"A lot of them have experienced repeated rapes [under Boko Haram], and some of them continue to suffer in the camps. It's not a picnic in the camps. Access to education is poor for a lot of them.\"\n\nResidents of the Malkohi camp, a government-run IDP camp just 30 minutes away from where the Chibok girls attend school\n\nA 60 Minutes team recently observed the stark disparity between the Chibok girls' lives and those living in IDP camps. Stahl, along with producers Alexandra Poolos and Kate Morris, first visited the Chibok girls at their school in Nigeria's Adamawa State, then traveled to the Malkohi camp, a small IDP camp only 30 minutes away.\n\n\"The contrast was striking and almost painful to see,\" Stahl told 60 Minutes Overtime in the video above.\n\nMany of the children in the Malkohi IDP camp do not attend school\n\nThe women 60 Minutes spoke with in the Malkohi camp said they don't have enough food to eat; the monthly rations are meager and must be shared among many. Some forage for wild leaves in the bush to supplement their diets.\n\nWoman at the Malkohi IDP camp told 60 Minutes they must forage for wild leaves to supplement their diets\n\n\"Why that's so striking is because that, eating grass, was the condition that the Chibok girls were in under Boko Haram,\" Stahl said.\n\nOne of the women in the camp, a middle-aged woman named Fatima, told 60 Minutes that she, too, had been kidnapped by Boko Haram. She said she was held for four months before escaping with the help of a Boko Haram militant, who quietly released her at the Cameroon border.\n\nFor more than four years, she has lived at Malkohi camp, where she said the conditions are awful.\n\nFatima, a resident of the Malkohi IDP camp, told 60 Minutes she had been kidnapped by Boko Haram and held for four months before escaping\n\n\"They only give two measures of rice for the whole month,\" she said. \"See how our children are really getting no soap, no nothing, no sleep mat, no lodging.\"\n\nFatima brought the 60 Minutes team into the area where she sleeps, a small room with mats on the floor that she said she shares with five others. As she began to complain about the setup, a representative with the camp interrupted her, pulled her aside, and told her not to let cameras film inside.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera last March, Bitrus Samuel, the National Emergency Management Agency's head in Abuja, said the Nigerian government says it is doing everything in its power to meet the humanitarian needs of IDPs across the country.\n\n\"IDPs issues have always been and will always be a priority for our government,\" Samuel said.\n\n60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl speaks with a young girl named Fatima, who is about the same age as the Chibok girls. Fatima said her family cannot afford for her to attend school\n\nThe 60 Minutes team saw the contrast between the Chibok girls and the women in the IDP camp most acutely with another, younger woman named Fatima, who is about the same age as those in school 30 minutes away.\n\n\"I had just come from the school, where these girls, I mean their lives are all about their future, wide open,\" Stahl said. \"And here is a girl, same age, seeing no path out for herself.\"\n\nThe younger Fatima told Stahl that Boko Haram insurgents had chased her family away from their home, and because the group is still killing people in her hometown, her family thinks it's safer to stay in the IDP camp. Fatima does not attend school; she said her family cannot afford it.\n\n\"I'm very unhappy because I'm not doing anything,\" she said. \"I don't have a job. I don't have a vocation.\"\n\nWhen Stahl asked her if she has hope for the future, she simply shook her head: \"No.\"\n\nTo watch Lesley Stahl's 60 Minutes report about the Chibok girls and their new school, click here.\n\nThe video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and Will Croxton.

We have not had a high-ranking executive from the pharmaceutical industry sit before our cameras, until now. Tonight, Ed Thompson, a drug manufacturer who spent decades managing and producing opioids for Big Pharma, breaks ranks to denounce his industry and its federal regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, which he says opened the floodgates on the crisis with a few little changes to a label.\n\nEd Thompson: The root cause of this epidemic is the FDA's illegal approval of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\nBill Whitaker: The FDA ignited this opioid crisis?\n\nEd Thompson: Without question, they start the fire.\n\nEd Thompson speaks with correspondent Bill Whitaker\n\nEd Thompson told us when the top selling opioid, Oxycontin, was first approved in 1995, it was based on science that only showed it safe and effective when used \"short-term.\" But in 2001, pressured by Big Pharma and pain sufferers, the FDA made a fateful decision and, with no new science to back it up, expanded the use of Oxycontin to just about anyone with chronic ailments like arthritis and back pain.\n\nEd Thompson: So this is what a package insert looks like.\n\nBill Whitaker: Wow\n\nThe FDA did it by simply changing a few words on the label, that lengthy insert no one ever reads. Today the label says the powerful pain pills are effective for \"daily, around-the-clock, long-term\u2026 treatment.\" And that small label change made a big change in the way drug companies would market all opioids, allowing them to sell more and more pills at higher and higher doses.\n\nEd Thompson: A drug's label is the single most important document for that product. It determines whether somebody can make $10 million or a billion dollars.\n\nBill Whitaker: How so?\n\nEd Thompson: Because it allows you to then promote the drug based on the labeling.\n\nEd Thompson owns PMRS, a successful Pennsylvania pharmaceutical company that manufactures drugs for Big Pharma. It's made him a rich man. But now he's putting his livelihood at risk. He's doing what no other drug maker has ever done, he's suing the FDA in federal court to force it to follow the science and limit the opioid label to short term use.\n\n\"There are no studies on the safety or efficacy of opioids for long-term use.\"\n\nThompson is challenging the FDA to start with his newest opioid. It's Thompson's creative way to sabotage the system. He may lose money rolling out his new drug, but if he is successful, it would set a precedent. Other manufacturers would be forced to change their labels and limit their marketing.\n\nBill Whitaker: A decision going in your direction could pull down a multi-billion-dollar industry.\n\nEd Thompson: Correct. Probably somewhere between $7 and $10 billion a year would come off the market. We made a decision to stop selling snake oil to U.S. citizens in 1962.\n\nBill Whitaker: Snake oil?\n\nEd Thompson: Yes, sir. You're using high-dose, long-duration opioids when they've never been designed to do that. There's no evidence that they're effective. There's extreme evidence of harms and deaths when you use them.\n\nBrandeis professor Dr. Andrew Kolodny is one of the country's most-recognized addiction specialists and has been an expert witness in litigation against Big Pharma, including Purdue, the maker of Oxycontin. He has been trying to get the FDA label changed since 2011 to make clear opioids are not for everyone.\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny: These are essential medicines for easing suffering at the end of life and when used for a couple of days after major surgery or a serious accident. If you're taking them around the clock every day, quickly, you become tolerant to the pain-relieving effect. In order to continue getting pain relief, you'll need higher and higher doses. As the doses get higher, the treatment becomes more dangerous and the risk of death goes up.\n\nBill Whitaker: That sounds exactly like heroin addiction.\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny: It's essentially the same drug.\n\nTo understand how this began we traveled to this small courthouse in Welch, West Virginia, where we uncovered the minutes of secret meetings in 2001 between Purdue Pharma and the FDA. The files were part of the state's lawsuit against Purdue for deceitful marketing.\n\n60 Minutes got a court order to obtain these documents. They reveal it was at those secret meetings the FDA bowed to Purdue Pharma's demands to ignore the lack of scientific data, and changed the label to, \"around the clock\u2026for an extended period of time.''\n\nEd Thompson: I can't think of anything more harmful taking place that took place then. It opened the floodgates. It was the decision of no return for the FDA.\n\nPurdue told us Oxycontin always was approved for long-term use. But an internal document shows the company was jubilant about the labeling change. Quote: \"The action by the FDA\u2026has created enormous opportunities\" to expand the market. The drug company's ads soon extolled the virtues of Oxycontin's effectiveness and sales tripled.\n\nDr. David Kessler: It was a marketing tsunami. And the agency didn't catch it.\n\n60 Minutes has called on former FDA commissioner David Kessler many times for his expertise on drug safety issues. He ran the FDA in the 1990s when Oxycontin was first approved, but he left before the labeling change. Today, he's been retained by cities and counties suing Big Pharma for the opioid crisis. After reviewing the documents we obtained, and checking on his own, he says changing the label to long-term use was a mistake.\n\nDr. David Kessler: There are no studies on the safety or efficacy of opioids for long-term use.\n\nBill Whitaker: But there's a law that says that a drug cannot be promoted as safe and effective unless it's proven to be safe and effective. But yet, with FDA sanction, these opioids are being used in that way that you say have not been proven.\n\nDr. David Kessler: That's correct. The rigorous kind of scientific evidence that the agency should be relying on is not there.\n\nThe label change was a blank check \u2013 one the drug industry cashed in for billions and billions of dollars. Now, Big Pharma had a green light to push opioids to tens of millions of new pain patients nationwide.\n\nBill Whitaker: Let me remind you of some of the words that you have used to describe the pharmaceutical industry, your industry.\n\nEd Thompson: Yeah?\n\nBill Whitaker: Corrupt.\n\nEd Thompson: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: Immoral?\n\nEd Thompson: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: Depraved?\n\nEd Thompson: Yes. They're appropriate for the behavior that's taken place.\n\nBill Whitaker: You are a drug executive. You manufacture drugs.\n\nEd Thompson: Many drugs.\n\nBill Whitaker: Are you at fault in this epidemic in any way?\n\nEd Thompson: I wish I was smart enough to have seen this epidemic before-- before I got three or four years into it. Absolutely. But once you find out that it's not correct, you have to do the right thing. Is there anything more important?\n\nEmily Walden: My son wanted to fight for his country. His country failed him.\n\nIf there is one victim who confirmed for Ed Thompson that turning on his industry was the right thing to do, it was Emily Walden, who would become an unlikely ally. Thompson manufactured an opioid oxymorphone. The same drug that took the life of Walden's son TJ, a private in the Kentucky National Guard.\n\nEmily Walden: He was getting ready to be deployed to Africa and a few weeks prior to that he went on a camping trip with a group of friends and a police officer knocked on my door the next morning telling me that he had passed away.\n\nTj had grown addicted to the drug and was easily able to get it without a prescription. Walden went to Washington, D.C. to ask the FDA why her community was being flooded with pain pills. It was there she met Ed Rhompson.\n\nBill Whitaker: What did you say to him?\n\nEmily Walden: \"You manufactured the drug that killed my son.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: He is now on your side.\n\nEmily Walden: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: That just seems like an odd connection.\n\nEmily Walden: It is. But Ed might be my only hope in getting this fixed. The FDA's responsibility is public health and the safety of drugs, and they're not doing their job. They haven't been doing their job for 20 years.\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny agrees. The Brandeis addiction specialist began his own investigation into why the FDA would approve the long-term use of opioids when there was no credible science to back it up.\n\nBill Whitaker: What did you find?\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny: We found out that a group of experts and FDA and pharmaceutical companies were having private meetings and at these meetings, changing the rules for how opioids get approved.\n\nHe filed Freedom of Information Act Requests. In email after email between the FDA, Big Pharma and consultants, he learned of closed-door meetings at luxury hotels, like this Four Seasons in Washington, DC, where for $35,000 a piece, drug makers paid consultants to, \"sit at a small table with the FDA,\" \"hobnobbing with the regulators.\" Emails show one participant worrying it might be seen as \"pay to play.\"\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny: They had drugs in their pipeline, pain medicines that they wanted approved. And through these meetings, they were able to get those products on the market.\n\nBill Whitaker: That sounds unethical.\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny: It is unethical.\n\nBill Whitaker: If not illegal\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny: If it's not illegal, it should be illegal.\n\nEqually suspicious but legal, the large number of key FDA regulators who went through the revolving door to jobs with drug manufacturers. The two medical officers, who originally approved Oxycontin, Curtis Wright and Douglas Kramer, went to work for the opioid maker, Purdue Pharma, not long after leaving the FDA.\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny: The culture at FDA continues to be much too cozy with the industry it's supposed to be regulating.\n\nThe agency bills drug companies more than $800 million a year in fees and depends on that industry money to pay the salaries of staffers who not only changed the opioid label, but also review new drugs like Dsuvia, the most powerful opioid pill ever approved.\n\nDr. David Kessler\n\nBill Whitaker: Just a few weeks ago the FDA approved a new opioid that is 1,000 times more powerful than morphine. And this is in the middle of this opioid epidemic. How is that possible?\n\nDr. David Kessler: I don't get it. I get your question; I don't get the agency's action.\n\nBill Whitaker: Isn't the FDA supposed to be our watchdogs to protect us?\n\nDr. David Kessler: How many people do you think were working in a division that oversaw promotion or when this epidemic started to occur?\n\nBill Whitaker: I have no idea.\n\nDr. David Kessler: Five.\n\nBill Whitaker: When I'm looking at the carnage in American towns and cities, that just doesn't seem like a good excuse to me.\n\nDr. David Kessler: It's not an excuse. It's the reality. You have a system of pharmaceutical promotion that changed the way medicine practiced and no one, all right, stopped it.\n\nCurrent FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb declined our request for an interview but, in a statement said, \"the FDA has taken aggressive steps to confront the crisis,\" but he admitted \"many mistakes were made along the way... While the agency followed the law in approving and regulating opioids, we at the FDA include ourselves among those who should have acted sooner.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: You say they have to do things to fix the label. The label has been in place since 2001. I-- I'm not a scientist, but that doesn't seem like that's that hard to do.\n\nDr. David Kessler: And it needs to be done.\n\nEd Thompson: We got a real problem here.\n\nEd Thompson isn't waiting. He has now joined a growing movement of doctors, lawyers, and patient activists who want Big Pharma to kick its addiction to opioid profits. That's why he made the decision to take on his industry and the FDA.\n\nBill Whitaker: If you succeed, you could pull down a multibillion-dollar industry.\n\nEd Thompson: And if I fail, you're gonna have ever-increasing deaths every day as well. It's a pretty good decision, isn't it?\n\nProduced by Ira Rosen and Sam Hornblower"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/revisiting-the-calls-for-change-after-the-parkland-shooting-60-minutes/", "text": "Editor's Note: A year ago Thursday, a gunman killed 14 students and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The following month, 60 Minutes' Sharyn Alfonsi spoke with a group of survivors from the school who demanded lawmakers offer more than just \"thoughts and prayers\" in response to the shooting. Below is a transcript of that story.\n\nBy now the story is familiar but no less heartbreaking. On Valentine's Day, a former student walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida, pulled an AR-15 out of his duffle bag and began shooting. Students hid in closets and played dead. When it was over 17 people were killed -- 14 of them students. In the hours that followed, there were vigils and a string of lawmakers offered their \"thoughts and prayers.\" Then, something different happened. The students of Stoneman Douglas gathered in living rooms and in front of cameras, declaring never again. In less than a month, the teens did what few thought possible, they changed gun laws in Florida and ignited a national movement. We wondered how a generation with a notoriously short attention span plans to hold the nation's attention. You'll hear from them later. But we begin with another classmate who hasn't been seen or heard from since the shooting.\n\n\"He told me, 'Dad I got shot.' I just said, 'keep talking to me, ok, don't go. Don't leave me, keep talking to me.'\"\n\nThis is Anthony Borges. He is 15 years old and should be at soccer practice. But when we met him on Tuesday, he was struggling to breathe. He'd just come off a ventilator the day before. Anthony's father Roger told us his son has had eight surgeries already. Another is being scheduled. He was shot five times just outside his classroom at Stoneman Douglas High.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: He was face to face with the shooter?\n\nRoger Borges: Yeah. He got shot in the leg, and he tried to shut the door.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: He tried to shut the door?\n\nRoger Borges: In that moment he received another in the back.\n\nThe Borges family is from Venezuela. Roger wanted the world to see what happened to his son.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: He called you, right?\n\nRoger Borges: Yeah he called me right at the moment he laid down on the floor and he told me 'Dad I got shot'. I just said keep talking to me -- ok -- don't go-- don't leave me-- keep talking to me.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And where was he shot?\n\nRoger Borges: Right here. Right here.\n\nOne shattered his thigh bone. Another damaged a lung and liver.\n\nRoger Borges: That's a miracle for me.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: This is a miracle that he's still alive?\n\nRoger Borges: Yeah.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: That he is not number 18\n\nRoger Borges: No. No.\n\nRoger, a handyman, is now praying for another miracle: help paying his son's medical bills. Stories like Anthony's unfold quietly in hospitals after every mass shooting. But what happened in Parkland is different. Instead of retreating into their gated neighborhoods, and asking for privacy or saying it was \"too soon\" to talk about guns, Parkland decided it was exactly the right moment to talk about guns. It was the students who stepped forward first and said never again. You've probably heard a lot from them over the last month, but we were surprised about what they had to say about the fate of the gunman.\n\nAlex Wind, Jaclyn Corin, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez speak with correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi CBS News\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: The Florida prosecutor announced today that he's gonna seek the death penalty against Nikolas Cruz. And I just wanna get your thoughts on that. Emma?\n\nEmma Gonzalez: Good.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Good why?\n\nEmma Gonzalez: Good that he's seeking the death penalty for Nick Cruz.\n\nCameron Kasky: I don't wanna think about Nick Cruz. I think the more we think about him, the more he wins. That being said, in a way I disagree with Emma. Let him rot forever.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Let him rot in jail.\n\nDavid Hogg: I wanna see him rot forever as Cameron just said, but when we pursue the death penalty, this will be kept in the media for much longer.\n\nJaclyn Corin: I just don't want him to get what he wants. I want him to suffer no matter what.\n\nAlex Wind: The death of one person, as terrible of a person as he is, cannot outweigh the death of the 17.\n\n\"I was born months after Columbine. I'm 17 years old, and we've had 17 years of mass shootings.\"\n\nAlex Wind, a self-described theater geek, Jaclyn Corin, the junior class president, student reporter David Hogg, and senior Emma Gonzalez started what they call the never-again movement in Cameron Kasky's living room. In the hours after the attack, filled with grief but fueled with anger and armed with their phones, the teenagers got to work. First, they set off a firestorm of tweets, many aimed at lawmakers. They said yes to almost every interview request and used social media to organize a student-led protest at the state capitol. In three weeks, they'd convinced Florida's Republican Governor Rick Scott to defy the National Rifle Association, something that hasn't happened in Florida in 20 years.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: The new Florida law raises the age to buy a rifle to 21. It introduces a three-day waiting period on gun sales, and it makes more money available for mental health services. Give us a grade on what's been accomplished.\n\nCameron Kasky: C.\n\nDavid Hogg: I was gonna say C-minus.\n\nJaclyn Corin: We can't praise them for doing what they've done because that wouldn't have stopped what happened at our school.\n\nCameron Kasky: That being said the Florida bill is much more impressive than that embarrassing Stop School Violence Act that they're pushing in D.C. which is just a bunch of hot air, fluff. Doesn't use the word gun once when all these tragedies, again, the one thing that has linked them together is the gun.\n\nOn Saturday, they're hoping a half million people will join them to march in Washington. They want Congress to ban military-style rifles along with the kind of high-capacity magazines that were used in Las Vegas, and at Sandy Hook.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: I know I can't help but think. \"Sandy Hook happened. Those parents made it their life's mission to try to get some real change. What makes you think that you guys could do more? That this could be different?\n\nAlex Wind: The thing about it is we are the generation that's had to be trapped in closets, waiting for police to come or waiting for a shooter to walk into our door. We are the people who know what it's like first-hand.\n\nCameron Kasky: We're the mass shooting generation.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: \"We're the mass shooting generation.\"\n\nCameron Kasky: I was born months after Columbine. I'm 17 years old, and we've had 17 years of mass shootings.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Raise your hands if there are guns in your house.\n\nCameron Kasky: I feel safe because my father has a gun in the house that he can use to protect our family. My family lives on the principle that there are some guns that are made to protect your family from anyone who might come in and try to hurt them, and there are some guns that are made for war.\n\nEmma Gonzalez CBS News\n\nEmma Gonzalez at rally: We need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He wouldn't have hurt that many people with a knife!\n\nThree days after the shooting, Emma Gonzalez accepted an invitation to speak at a rally. The five-foot-two 18-year-old had to stand on boxes to be heard. Her speech was seen millions of times and ignited the passion of students around the country. She now has more than a million Twitter followers, ten times more than Florida's governor.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: So why was it you? Why do you think you broke through?\n\nEmma Gonzalez: It might've been my hair.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Oh, come on.\n\nEmma Gonzalez: Very honestly, it just might have been my hair.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: I don't think it was the hair.\n\nEmma Gonzalez: I think it was a little bit the hair. Like, you know, just iconically you think of the picture and you think of a bald girl.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What do you think about this issue of arming teachers?\n\nEmma Gonzalez: It's stupid.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why?\n\nEmma Gonzalez: First of all, they have-- Douglas ran out of paper for, like, two weeks in the school year, and now all the sudden they have $400 million to pay for teachers to get trained to arm themselves? Really? Really? If you have-- if you're a teacher and you have a gun, do you keep it in a lockbox or do you carry it on your person? If the teacher dies and a student who's a good student is able to get the gun are they now held responsible to shoot the student who's come into the door? I'm not happy with that.\n\nEmma's mother Beth watched as her daughter became one of the most recognizable faces in one of the most polarizing debates in the country.\n\nBeth Gonzalez: I'm terrified. It's like she built herself a pair of wings out of balsa wood and duct tape and jumped off a building. And we're just, like, running along beneath her with a net, which she doesn't want or think that she needs, you know?\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What is happening to her life?\n\nBeth Gonzalez: It's insane. Somebody said, \"Please tell Emma we're behind her,\" which I appreciate. But we shoulda been in front of her, I should've been in front of her. We're all adults, we shoulda dealt with this 20 years ago.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: It's a lot to ask of these kids.\n\nBeth Gonzalez: They're asking it of themselves. Some are like, you go girl. But I'm like, what are we doing?\n\nThe Douglas students inspired a walkout at nearly 3,000 schools for 17 minutes this past Wednesday. One minute for every life lost in Parkland. They allowed us into their newly donated headquarters. We agreed not to reveal the location.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why are we being secretive?\n\nDavid Hogg CBS News\n\nEmma Gonzalez: People have sent us a lot of death threats. And I, for one, am paranoid about a bomb being thrown in the window.\n\nDavid Hogg: The fact that I'm getting death threats, Emma's getting death threats, Cameron's getting death threats, it shows the polarized state that America's in.\n\nManuel Oliver: The victims are being represented by people that could've been the victim, all right?\n\nManuel and Patricia Oliver's son was murdered in the shooting. Joaquin was 17 years old and considered one of the most well-liked kids in school. Oliver still coaches Joaquin's basketball team. He knows these kids.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What is it that these kids can do that adults haven't been able to do in the past?\n\nManuel Oliver: These kids have their cell phones on their hands all day. And and we as parents we criticize that a lot 'cause we ignore the power of that. The difference between this tragedy and others, if you ask me, is that this generation is used to get answers right away. You think they're gonna wait for six months or a year for anybody in Congress or anybody that needs to make the right call?\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: They're hardwired to do things quickly.\n\nManuel Oliver: Absolutely. Right away.\n\nThe students have already received more than $3 million in donations, most of it from Hollywood.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You guys have gotten checks from big names. George Clooney. Oprah Winfrey. Michael Bloomberg's gun control group is helping you. The Women's March people are helping you. How do you make sure those people aren't using you for their specific agendas?\n\nCameron Kasky: Well, we don't let them. You see, that's the thing. We all remember everybody has an agenda.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: These are people with decades of experience. Are they giving you guidance?\n\nCameron Kasky: I can't get a hotel room on my own. I'm 17 years old. Of course, we have people helping us with that. I can't get the city permits for ten blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC. We allow them to help where they can, but we make sure that we are calling the shots. And everybody who tries to call the shot for us, we respectfully say, \"That's not what this is about.\"\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Have you had to do that? Have you seen people trying to push back on you guys?\n\nCameron Kasky: Politicians have asked us to endorse them. Nope. You can support us all you want, but if you think you can get your hands on our movement? It's just not gonna happen.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Have you turned people away who have offered money?\n\nCameron Kasky: Yes.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And why have you turned them away?\n\nCameron Kasky: Because they said, \"Here's some money if you do this.\" The second we get an \"if,\" sorry. It's gone.\n\nDuring our interview, Alex had to leave early for a theatre performance. Cameron, for a family dinner. They are trying to live their teenage lives, and protect them.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you ever think, \"I don't wanna get into this. This is a nasty fight that I don't wanna be in the middle of\"?\n\nEmma Gonzalez: I mean, I have no choice.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Well, you do. You don't have to.\n\nEmma Gonzalez: No I don't.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why?\n\nEmma Gonzalez: I have no choice because there were-- there were CNN cameras there. My speech was broadcast all over the country in, like, four seconds, and I had no idea they were going to be there. I'm not upset at that. I'm just never going to be the same person again.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Do you think you'll be able to go back to your life?\n\nEmma Gonzalez: I hope so. I don't know. It feels like it's been a year.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: It does.\n\nEmma Gonzalez: It really has.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: It's been a month.\n\nEmma Gonzalez: It's been less than a month.\n\nProduced by Guy Campanile, Andrew Bast and Lucy Boyd.

Today, tens of thousands of the extremists are dead, captured, in hiding or on the run, and the battle is entering its final phase. Americans know about the barbarity of ISIS but what's less understood is how the U.S. went about destroying ISIS as a military force, who has been fighting alongside American troops, and what remains to be done. Tonight we'll take you inside America's war against ISIS in Syria.\n\nLast October, ISIS lost control of the city of Raqqa, its headquarters for more than three years. We were there as the city shuddered, pummeled by more than four thousand U.S. coalition airstrikes. Those civilians who could, fled to safety, while ISIS snipers and suicide bombers lurked inside the splintered buildings of a ghost town, covered in the stench of death.\n\nWhen we returned this past June, there were signs of life. Families coming home, taxis running in the streets, and residents rebuilding as best they could. It was there we met Laila Mustafa, a 30-year-old woman, in charge of resurrecting this skeleton of a city.\n\nCorrespondent Holly Williams walks through Raqqa with Laila Mustafa\n\nHolly Williams: Is this what victory over ISIS looks like?\n\nBorn and raised here, Mustafa trained as a civil engineer. She was chosen by a group of community leaders to run the new civilian council and is the closest thing Raqqa has to a mayor.\n\nHolly Williams: So, this is Al Naim, this is where ISIS used to execute people?\n\nLaila Mustafa (Translation): They used to kill innocent civilians in Raqqa, put their-- heads on spikes for days. They wanted to show brutality in order to make people obey them.\n\nISIS justified its brutality as the only correct interpretation of Islamic Law, the same reason the extremists insisted that women cover nearly every inch of their bodies in public.\n\nHolly Williams: So last year when ISIS was still in charge of Raqqa, women couldn't show their faces in this city. And now you, a woman, you're in charge of the city.\n\nLaila Mustafa (Translation): It's a challenge. A challenge to the mentality of ISIS. And a challenge for women to emerge from the struggles of injustice, violence, and exploitation.\n\nLaila Mustafa told us that many of the Syrian fighters who helped defeat ISIS in Raqqa were women, members of a militia group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF.\n\nWhen America was searching for allies on the ground, the SDF stepped forward to fight and die. Block by block, house by house, they became the foot soldiers who took \"the state\" out of the Islamic State. Since its peak in 2014, when ISIS brought their reign of terror to a swath of land in Syria and Iraq roughly the size of Indiana, their self-proclaimed caliphate has shrunk to a few pockets in the desert.\n\nA senior U.S. military officer told us much of the credit belongs to this man: SDF leader General Mazlum Kobane. He's reclusive, and doesn't give many interviews, in part, because he's worried he'll be assassinated.\n\nHolly Williams: How many soldiers do you have under your command?\n\nGeneral Kobane (Translation): 60,000.\n\nHolly Williams: How big was your militia when you first started out?\n\nGeneral Kobane (Translation): When I started out with my comrades, there were 30 of us.\n\nGeneral Kobane built his army in Syria with farmers, factory workers and students. Members of an ethnic minority known as the Kurds dominate the militia. For decades in Syria the Kurds were treated as second-class citizens, but they've transformed themselves into a disciplined and tenacious fighting force.\n\nGeneral Mazlum Kobane\n\nHolly Williams: How many ISIS fighters have you and your Americans partners killed, roughly?\n\nGeneral Kobane (Translation): It's really difficult to give you an accurate number. But I would imagine the rough number would be around 20,000.\n\nHolly Williams: You know, General, you come across as-- as quiet and-- and mild-mannered and even a bit shy. And I have to tell you, it's not what I expected of a feared militia leader.\n\nGeneral Kobane (Translation): Thank you.\n\nHolly Williams: How long do you think it's going to take you to claw back the last remaining pockets of ISIS territory here in Syria?\n\nGeneral Kobane (Translation): We believe toward the end of this year.\n\nSources in the U.S. military concur. Just outside the town of Al-Shaddadah we saw American special operations forces working with the SDF to close in on one of the last remaining ISIS safe havens. Around 2,000 U.S. troops are serving in SDF-controlled territory. The desert is dotted with American bases.\n\nWe wanted to talk to someone in charge at the Pentagon or the State Department, but they both declined our requests. Instead, we spoke to two U.S. senators who both sit on the Armed Services Committee and recently visited Syria: South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen: The strategy has been let's defeat ISIS. And we're well on our way there. And this really has happened against very long odds with very few Americans with very little money.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: The Kurds have come forward when nobody else would to help us destroy ISIS, which is a threat to you, me, her, and everybody else.\n\nHolly Williams: What do you wanna tell the American people about America's partners in Syria?\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: They're worth investing in. They've done most of the fighting. They've done most of the dying. If they take over, they will work with us. This is a damn good deal. Take it.\n\nSenators Jeanne Shaheen and Lindsey Graham\n\nThe SDF has lost 12,000 fighters, according to General Kobane. Sons and daughters sacrificed in the fight against ISIS. But they've also gained the protection of the world's most powerful military. And with American weapons and training have taken control of about a third of Syria.\n\nFrom the Tigris River in the east to the Euphrates in the West, the rest of the country, after seven years of chaos and civil war is mostly back in the hands of the Syrian Regime.\n\nHolly Williams: Five years ago, in your wildest dreams, did you think that one day you'd be partnered with the U.S. military?\n\nGeneral Kobane (Translation): Honestly, no. We never thought this would happen and the Americans would come here. But it happened.\n\nNot everyone is happy about America's newfound friendship with the Kurds in Syria. The relationship infuriates Turkey, a long-standing U.S. ally that now shares a 250-mile border with SDF territory.\n\nTurkey considers the Kurdish forces in Syria to be a terrorist organization, because of their deep ties to a group blamed for deadly attacks within Turkey.\n\nHolly Williams: America has a history of partnering up with the good guys who then turn out to be the bad guys. I mean how can you be sure that's not going to happen here?\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: I know what they've done. They like us. We couldn't last 15 minutes if they did not--\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen: Right.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: --protect us.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen: They provide the security for our troops, those forward operating bases that are in that part of Syria. It's the SDF who provides a security for our forces.\n\nThe SDF aren't just protecting American troops, they're also holding several hundred foreign ISIS fighters captured during the war. We were allowed into one of their prisons and got a glimpse inside a cell holding foreign extremists.\n\nHolly Williams reflects on ISIS in Syria\n\nOne of the SDF's ISIS detainees is Adrien Guihal, who served three years in prison in his native France for plotting with others to attack the police and a subway station. Back in France he was also a preacher. The SDF consider Guihal a dangerous terrorist. Guihal denies it and says he only worked for ISIS as a translator. A member of the SDF was present for our interview.\n\nHolly Williams: Do you want to go back to France?\n\nAdrien Guihal (Translation): Yes\n\nHolly Williams: And does France want you back?\n\nAdrien Guihal (Translation): No, I don't think so. France's position is they don't take back citizens who were in the Islamic State.\n\nHolly Williams: So what does that mean? Does that mean you could be here for several years, perhaps the rest of your life?\n\nAdrien Guihal (Translation): It's not in my hands.\n\nAdrien Guihal has not yet officially been charged with a crime. He and other foreign ISIS prisoners from some 40 different countries are, for the time being, in legal purgatory.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: So you've got 600-plus foreign fighters, not Syrians, and the Europeans don't wanna deal with this.\n\nHolly Williams: And it sounds like the bottom line is that America's Syrian partners are keeping us safe from hundreds of potentially dangerous extremists.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: It's-- it's a fact that they are.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen: But it's not-- but it's also not a long-term solution.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: It won't work long-term.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen: We need to work with the European communities and we need to figure out long-term how we're going to deal with these detainees.\n\nLaila Mustafa\n\nBack in Raqqa, Laila Mustafa, who runs the city's civilian council, is still dealing with a city in ruins. She told us more than two-thirds of the houses in her hometown have been damaged or destroyed, as well as schools, hospitals, and power stations.\n\n\n\nHolly Williams: You've gone to every neighborhood, you've figured out how much money you need. Now you need the money?\n\nLaila Mustafa (Translation): Yes, as I said, the support we are getting isn't enough to meet our needs.\n\nLaila Mustafa told us ISIS sleeper cells remain in Raqqa. She fears the group could make a comeback, especially if the city is not rebuilt.\n\nWhile we were there, the U.S. State Department had temporarily frozen around $200 million of civilian aid. In August, it was canceled.\n\nHolly Williams: So we spoke to the new-- a woman called Laila Mustafa, a 30-year-old woman who is now essentially the mayor of Raqqa. And--\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: What poetic justice.\n\nHolly Williams: She said to us, \"The world has a responsibility to help us rebuild.\" Do you agree with that?\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: Her success is our success. So here's what I would say to her: We're all in to help you because if you're in charge of Raqqa, ISIS won't come back and you can live in peace with us.\n\nHolly Williams: But she didn't get the $200 million that she needs to help de-mine and rebuild her city.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen: That's why we're here. It's to talk about what we saw and why it's in America's interest.\n\nAmerica and its allies have brought ISIS to the brink of destruction in this part of Syria, but the Islamic State has been replaced, by a state of uncertainty.\n\nProduced by Keith Sharman and Omar Abdulkader.

We have learned one place under scrutiny by federal investigators is Buffalo, New York. In August, information about dozens of accused priests was leaked from the diocesan secret archive. What it revealed, infuriated many of Buffalo's 600,000 Catholics. Tonight, you will hear from a priest who will share his direct knowledge about what he has called a cover-up. But first, the anonymous whistleblower who uncovered proof that Bishop Richard Malone withheld the names of dozens of priests accused of abuse.\n\n\"At the end of my life, I'm not going to answer to Bishop Malone. I'm going to answer to God.\"\n\nUntil now, Siobhan O'Connor had carefully kept her identity secret.\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: I had to rely on God even more than I ever have before.\n\nShe is the whistleblower who leaked records from the secret archive of the Diocese of Buffalo. Siobhan O'Connor worked closely with Bishop Richard Malone as his executive assistant for three years. Last week she spoke with the FBI.\n\nCorrespondent Bill Whitaker with Siobhan O'Connor\n\nBill Whitaker: Some people would say that you betrayed Bishop Malone.\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: I did betray him, and yet I can't apologize for that, because there was a greater good to consider.\n\nThe hundreds of pages Siobhan O'Connor uncovered included personnel files and memos. They revealed that for years Bishop Malone allowed priests accused of sexual assault such as statutory rape and groping to stay on the job.\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: I love my church, I love our diocese, and I-- I loved him. I-- I genuinely did as my bishop and as my boss.\n\nBill Whitaker: So why are you doing this?\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: The reality of what I saw really left me with no other option. Because at the end of my life, I'm not going to answer to Bishop Malone. I'm going to answer to God.\n\nAt first, she took pictures with her phone. Then she used the copy machine at the bishop's offices. The documents provided an extraordinary window into how the diocese handled abuse.\n\nBill Whitaker: And nobody caught on to what you were doing?\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: No, they didn't. I was always working with paper, and I was always there, so it wasn't as though I had to ask for keys or take them from someone's desk.\n\nHer decision to act was influenced by the phone calls she fielded from dozens of people who said they had been abused. O'Connor says she tried to get the bishop to be more responsive to them. He would tell her it's not her concern. She said by last summer she was, in her words, \"morally allergic\" to what she witnessed. Just before O'Connor quit her job in August, she anonymously leaked the church documents to a reporter at Buffalo television station WKBW.\n\nBill Whitaker: There was no other way you saw to handle this?\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: Not with any expediency, no. I mean, I-- I did hope and pray that a grand jury would eventually be convened and that there would be hopefully an independent investigation, but I felt that there could be other victims between now and then, and I-- I couldn't have that on my conscience if there was a way to prevent that.\n\nBishop Richard Malone\n\nHer doubts began in March. Bishop Malone had agreed to release a list of 42 priests accused of sexually abusing minors. But O'Connor knew there should be more names because she had seen the draft list that circulated between the bishop and diocesan lawyers. There was also something else, a dossier about priests she discovered in a supply closet.\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: There was one particular binder, which was of pending litigation that had been presented to Bishop Malone when he first was installed as our bishop. And this was from the lawyers. And this was a large, over 300-page binder, and I found it when I was cleaning the closet where they kept the bishop's vacuum. And I remember finding this obviously very important and sensitive information and thinking, \"How did it ever end up here, first of all?\" And-- and then I was shocked at the volume of it.\n\nThe cases in the dossier Bishop Malone inherited when he arrived in 2012 stretched back decades. As they worked on the list, the bishop and his lawyers decided they would not reveal the names of accused priests still in ministry.\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: It was a very carefully curated list. And I-- I saw all the-- the lawyers coming in and out, and I was aware of the-- the various strategies that were in place.\n\nBill Whitaker: What were they trying to do if not help the victims?\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: Well, to my mind the overarching attitude seemed to be to protect the church's reputation and her assets.\n\nBill Whitaker: And the assets?\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: Uh-huh. Very much so.\n\nWhy Bishop Malone's assistant became a whistleblower\n\nSiobhan O'Connor was most alarmed to see that Father Arthur Smith was missing from the list. Church records showed two young men in Buffalo had complained in 2013 that Smith had inappropriately touched them. Two years before that, Smith was sent to counseling after repeated contact with an eighth-grade boy that included unwanted attention and facebook messages. Despite what Bishop Malone knew, he endorsed Smith for a job as a cruise ship chaplain. The bishop wrote, \"I am unaware of anything in his background which would render him unsuitable to work with minor children\".\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: Our previous bishop had removed him from ministry, so I always thought it was odd that Bishop Malone had reinstated him. When I explored his file more in-depth, that might have really been the moment when I knew that I had to do something with this information.\n\nRemember, the diocese list had 42 names. The documents O'Connor revealed put the number of Buffalo priests facing claims of all types of abuse at 118.\n\nBill Whitaker: They had accusations against them, credible accusations.\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: Yes, that's right.\n\nBill Whitaker: What'd you think of that?\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: I felt that instead of being transparent, we were almost being the opposite or-- or half transparent. Here are the names that we would like you to know about, but please don't ask us about the rest.\n\nOne of them was Father Fabian Maryanski. His file included an accusation that during the 1980's he had sexual relations with a girl that began when she was just 15. The diocese knew about it but a note in the file argued Maryanski should be excluded from the list of problem priests. It said, \"We did not remove him from ministry despite full knowledge of the case, and so including him on list might require explanation.\"\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: And I remember thinking, if that's their rationale for leaving a priest off, then how can I abide by this?\n\nShe was not alone. Father Bob Zilliox advised the bishop on church law, including abuse cases. He told us he was disgusted by how the cases he saw were handled.\n\nFather Bob Zilliox\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: I think the hypocrisy, the lip service, you know, the, \"Yes, Bob, I agree with you,\" and then I would walk out of an office and nothing would happen.\n\nIt is exceedingly rare for a Catholic priest to risk challenging his bishop in public. Father Zilliox left his role as the bishop's counsel in May to concentrate on his parish ministry.\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: A lot of cases should have been handled differently. They were not. A lot of cases probably should have gone to Rome at the time. They did not.\n\nBill Whitaker: How many of those priests should have been taken out of priesthood?\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: I would argue at least eight or nine.\n\nBill Whitaker: How many of them still are in the priesthood here in Buffalo?\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: All of them.\n\nBill Whitaker: All of them?\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: All the guys that should have been removed from the priesthood are still priests.\n\nBill Whitaker: What do you think of that?\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: It's beyond troubling. That's not the church. The church is holy. Those are individuals in the church who are weak and who have made very bad decisions. And because of that, they need to be held accountable for what they've done.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why is it, do you think, that the clergy fails to get this?\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: I think one of the factors that goes into decision making in terms of administration or leadership within diocese or in parishes is that there's a certain brotherhood. There's a certain mindset that we watch each other's backs.\n\nBehind the Buffalo bishop whistleblower story\n\nBishop Malone has the authority to strip Father Zilliox of his duties for going public. But the priest told us he is motivated to speak out by more than the truth. He also is a victim of sexual abuse by a Buffalo priest.\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: And so all of this has been very painful for me to see how our diocese, how other dioceses have handled this.\n\nBill Whitaker: How old were you when you were abused?\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: I was a 13-year-old boy.\n\nBill Whitaker: By a priest?\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: By a priest.\n\nBill Whitaker: How did that experience affect you while you were watching how Bishop Malone was handling these cases?\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: It was very difficult in a lot of different ways. There's a certain respect that is owed to a bishop. But when I saw things take place the way they did, I sort of was conflicted within. I think as a victim, I have a bias, which is maybe not a healthy thing, but objectively I can-- I have no tolerance for any abuse.\n\n\"I want these cardinals and bishops to start putting their ass on the line and start protecting their people.\"\n\nEvery bishop chooses a motto. Bishop Malone's is 'live the truth in love.' Bishop Malone declined our requests for an interview.\n\nPaul Snyder: He's behaving in a way that you would typically think that a CEO in a corporation that's being accused of corrupt practices might act, hiding behind attorneys.\n\nPaul Snyder was the first member of Buffalo's Catholic clergy to call for Malone to resign. The hotel owner is a deacon, that's an ordained member of the clergy who can be married and preside over some ceremonies. He was enraged by the information Siobhan O'Connor exposed.\n\nPaul Snyder\n\nBill Whitaker: Bishop Malone has called this a crisis. You call it a scandal. What's the difference?\n\nPaul Snyder: A crisis is we look at our home and it's burning to the ground. A scandal is while it's burning to the ground, you know how to put the fire out, but you don't tell me. You also know how the fire was caused, but you don't tell me. So you pretend to grieve with me about the fire, but the problem is you caused it.\n\nSnyder showed us some of the 400 notes and emails he has received since calling for the bishop to resign.\n\nPaul Snyder: They want to be part of the solution but they think this bishop is preventing that from occurring.\n\nThis month, Snyder sent letters and documents to prominent bishops demanding an investigation.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why do you have faith that the bishops are going to handle this?\n\nPaul Snyder: Well, I don't have faith right now that any particular bishops have the courage to do the right thing. I mean we all praise our martyrs on Sunday and we praise and we sing, but boy, its sure as hell is hard being a saint when it's your ass on the line. And I want these cardinals and bishops to start putting their ass on the line and start protecting their people.\n\nBishops hold supreme power in their diocese and answer only to the pope. Next month, U.S. bishops will gather to consider a proposal for a bishop code of conduct. Bishop Malone plans to be there. He's refused to resign.\n\nBishop Malone at August Press Conference: The shepherd does not desert the flock at a difficult time.\n\nThe bishop has made three public apologies and offered to sell his 11,000 square foot official residence to help compensate victims.\n\nLast week, he sent us a statement that said in part: \"We continue to reach out to victims, remove clergy with substantiated allegations from ministry and cooperate with federal and state investigations.\"\n\nBut in Bishop Malone's first six years in Buffalo just one priest was put on leave. It was only after this scandal broke in March, that he suspended 16 more for abuse. None have been kicked out of the priesthood.\n\nBill Whitaker: He has said he is sorry. He has apologized.\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: Uh-huh.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do you forgive him?\n\nFather Bob Zilliox: I accept it and I forgive him, but actions speak louder than words. Show us these cases are being handled properly. Show us these priests are being removed.\n\nBill Whitaker: You would like for Bishop Malone to resign?\n\nSiobhan O'Connor: I would. I-- I believe that it would be in the best interest of the diocese, because he's had opportunities to enact real change. And he's let those opportunities come and go.\n\nProduced by Guy Campanile and Lucy Boyd.

The French data protection commission fined Google 50 million euros ($57 million) for failing to inform users how it collects data for personalized ads. France's action was a result of complaints filed at the end of May by privacy advocates, including Max Schrems and his group, \"None of Your Business.\" Steve Kroft sat down with Schrems in November for the below story about Europe's sweeping new privacy law.\n\nThis has not been a great year for big tech; on Wall Street or in Washington. For decades, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have made vast sums monetizing the personal information of their users with almost no oversight or regulation. They are still making vast sums of money, but public attitudes about their size and power and their ability, or willingness, to police themselves are being called into question. A consensus is developing that something has to change and once again the impetus is coming from Europe which is becoming the world's leader in internet privacy and data protection. With a 31-year-old lawyer as the catalyst, the European Parliament has enacted a tough new law that has Silicon Valley scrambling to comply, and pressuring lawmakers here to do something about protecting your data.\n\nSeven times this year big tech has been called on the carpet to answer for data breaches, fake news, political meddling on the internet, and the endless amounts of personal information being gathered on Americans.\n\nSen. John Kennedy: I don't want to vote to have to regulate Facebook, but by God I will.\n\nSen. Mark Warner: The era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end.\n\nSen. John Thune: The question is no longer whether we need a federal law to protect consumers' privacy, the question is what shape will that law take?\n\nIn Europe, they already have a law in place. After levying multi-billion dollar fines against Google for anti-competitive behavior, the European Union enacted the world's most ambitious internet privacy law, even winning support from the CEO of the biggest tech company in America, Apple's Tim Cook.\n\nApple Inc. CEO Tim Cook has spoken in support of the GDPR Reuters\n\nTim Cook: This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, Cook did not say which companies he was talking about but Apple wasn't one of them. Its business model is making and selling phones and computers, not marketing personal information for advertising like Google and Facebook.\n\nTim Cook: Our own information from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency. It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.\n\n\"Americans have no control today about the information that's collected about them every second of their lives.\"\n\nMost people would agree that the point man in Europe has been a spikey-haired 31-year-old Viennese lawyer named Max Schrems who has been inflicting misery in Silicon Valley for the past seven years. He not only brought international attention to the issue of data privacy, he brought big tech lawyers into court. In the information age, he says data is the most important commodity. The question is who does it belong to.\n\nSteve Kroft: Who owns your data?\n\nMax Schrems: The legislation here says it's you that your data belongs to.\n\nSteve Kroft: You should have control over it.\n\nMax Schrems: You should have control over that. However, in an environment where there is no such law, basically, whoever factually has the power over it, which is usually the big tech company, owns it, in that sense.\n\nMax Schrems was a major force in drafting the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR. It became law in May, after a long battle with big tech, and every company that does business in Europe, including the most powerful ones in America, must comply. It was designed specifically to ensure that consumers, not tech companies, have control over the collection and use of their own personal information.\n\nSteve Kroft: What kind of new rights does this law give European citizens that people in the United States might not have?\n\nMax Schrems: The default under the European system is you're not allowed to use someone else's data unless you have a justification. And the result of that is that you have rights, like a right that-- you walk up to a company and say, \"Delete everything you have about me.\" You have a right to access. So you can say, \"I want to have a copy of everything you have about me.\" And all of these little elements in the law, overall, are meant to give you that power over your data that in an information society we should probably have.\n\nMax Schrems speaks to correspondent Steve Kroft CBS News\n\nAnd right now in the United States you have none of those legal rights.\n\nJeffrey Chester: Americans have no control today about the information that's collected about them every second of their lives.\n\nJeff Chester is the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. He has been a major voice on digital privacy for two decades, and says the only Americans guaranteed privacy on the internet are children under 13. He says there are some limitations on some specific medical and financial information, but the internet has rendered them obsolete.\n\nJeffrey Chester: There are no rules, there's not a government agency really protecting them. Any-- the companies can do whatever they want in terms of gathering our information and using it in any way they see fit.\n\nSteve Kroft: How did the big tech companies come to collect all this information?\n\nJeffrey Chester: No one ever told them they couldn't collect it all. There've been no limits at all ever established.\n\nSteve Kroft: And that's what's going on with GDPR, somebody saying, \"You can't?\"\n\nJeffrey Chester: That's exactly right. GDPR says you can't collect it without permission.\n\nThe big tech companies have always argued that consumers have given them permission to take their personal data in exchange for using the product. It's buried in the fine print on those long impenetrable online privacy agreements that you have to click on. Max Schrems says it's not free choice but constitutes coercion under the new European law.\n\nOn the day it was enacted Schrems' nonprofit group \"None of Your Business\" took action against Facebook and Google for allegedly violating European privacy laws.\n\nMax Schrems: It's this take it or leave it approach. You know it whenever you open an app it says, \"agree, or don't use the app\" and your choice is basically not existent because either you go offline \u2013 or you have to agree.\n\nSchrems cited the example of Google's Android operating system, the software which runs up to 80% of the world's smartphones. But to use one, you must first activate it and give Google consent to collect your personal data on all of its products.\n\nMax Schrems: You paid $1,000 right now and you're not allowed to use your $1,000 phone unless you agree that all the data goes to someone else. And that is basically forced consent.\n\nSteve Kroft: The tech companies say, \"Look, you, the user, you gave us permission to take this information to use it the way we wanted to. You agreed to it.\"\n\nMax Schrems: And that--\n\nSteve Kroft: \"You signed on. You made the deal.\"\n\nMax Schrems: The individual doesn't have the power, the time, the legal expertise to understand any of that. And then you're sitting at home at your desk and have the option to only say yes. This is not what any reasonable person would consider a fair deal.\n\nSchrems has been waging this battle since 2011 when he spent a semester in California at Santa Clara University School of Law. A lawyer from Facebook told his class that big tech didn't pay any attention to European privacy laws because they were rarely enforced and that the fines were very small.\n\nMax Schrems: it was obviously the case that ignoring European privacy laws was the much cheaper option. The maximum penalty, for example, in Austria was 20,000 euros. So just a lawyer telling you how to comply with the law was more expensive than breaking it.\n\nAt the time most people had no idea how much personal information was being collected on them, so when the 23-year-old Schrems returned to Austria he decided to ask Facebook if he could see what they had collected on him. By mistake or miracle, someone at Facebook sent him this stack of information, lifting the veil on the extent of the company's interest in him.\n\nMax Schrems: And after a while I got a PDF file with 1,200 pages after using Facebook for three years and I'm not a heavy user or anything like that.\n\nMax Schrems CBS News\n\nFacebook had created a dossier of max's life. That included his location history, events he attended, all of his contact information and his private Facebook messages, even the ones he thought he had deleted.\n\nSteve Kroft: So these were personal conversations you had that you thought were between yourself and the other person?\n\nMax Schrems: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: And they're all here?\n\nMax Schrems: They're all here, and they're basically undeletable.\n\nIt created a huge stir at the time, but it's nothing compared to what's being gathered now. Today, Facebook collects information on people who don't even have an account. Google's Android software knows whether the user is walking, running, or riding in a car. And Amazon has patented algorithms that could be used on its Echo smart speaker to listen in on continuous conversations, and even read the mood of people in the room.\n\nMax Schrems: The reality is that this industry is so fast-moving right now, even if you have perfect enforcement mechanisms, usually they will get away with it. Unless there is a serious penalty.\n\nToday, if one of the big tech companies chooses to ignore Europe's new data protection law it could cost them 4 percent of their global revenues, which for the biggest companies would mean billions of dollars.\n\nThose decisions will likely be made here in Dublin, the busiest of Europe's 28 data protection centers, and the place where most American tech companies have their European headquarters. They flocked here years ago because of Ireland's low corporate taxes and its reputation for relaxed regulation.\n\nIreland's data protection commissioner Helen Dixon says it's not going to be business as usual.\n\nHelen Dixon: U.S. internet companies have no doubt that this law is serious, it has serious bite And all of them are eager to avoid any engagement with that.\n\nSteve Kroft: How would you describe your relationship with these companies right now? Is the relationship cooperative or contentious?\n\nHelen Dixon: It's all of those things in any one week.\n\nHelen Dixon CBS News\n\nDixon says tech companies are spending tens of millions of dollars hiring lawyers, compliance officers and engineers to make sure they are operating within the law. The data protection authorities have only a few thousand employees in Europe to police some of the most powerful companies in the world, but they have subpoena power, can conduct raids, and even shut down operations.\n\nSteve Kroft: You think the big tech companies, the people in Silicon Valley are taking this seriously?\n\nEoin O'Dell: I think they have to.\n\nEoin O'Dell is a law professor at Trinity College in Dublin and a leading expert on European privacy law. He says Europe has now established an international standard for internet privacy, and companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon are not about to retreat from a $17 trillion market.\n\nEoin O'Dell: We have safety standards in cars, but that hasn't stopped us driving cars. We have emissions standards for \u2013 for the gas in the cars but that hasn't stopped us using the gas in the cars . The data companies are \u2013 going to comply in the same way as the \u2013 car companies have complied\n\nSteve Kroft: To stay in business.\n\nEoin O'Dell: To stay in business.\n\nSince the European privacy law was passed, at least ten other countries have adopted similar rules. So has the state of California.\n\nPerhaps sensing the inevitable, Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon are now saying they could support a U.S. privacy law if they were given considerable input. The Internet Association, which lobbies for big tech, and its president Michael Beckerman say they would support giving Americans reasonable access to their information and some privacy rights now enjoyed by the Europeans.\n\nMichael Beckerman CBS News\n\nSteve Kroft: From your point of view, who owns the data that's collected?\n\nMichael Beckerman: I think individuals should have complete control over their information. You should have access to it, both how you're giving it in the online world and offline world, and full transparency on who has the information and what you're getting for it.\n\nSteve Kroft: But who owns it?\n\nMichael Beckerman: People should have control over it. I don't view it as an ownership, you know, the way you're-- the way you're asking. But I think the individual--\n\nSteve Kroft: The Europeans do, the Europeans says it's a right. You own your information. You have a right--\n\nMichael Beckerman: We have--\n\nSteve Kroft: --to go to the companies and say, \"I want this information.\"\n\nMichael Beckerman: Under the law that we're pushing, and the rules that we're pushing, and what our companies already do, people can download the information-- their personal information that they've shared with the sites, and delete it if they want, and cancel their accounts.\n\nPrivacy advocate Jeff Chester says the industry wants people to believe that it's cooperating and open to change, but that it won't do anything until it's forced to by law.\n\nJeffrey Chester: This is simply a bait and switch in terms of protecting privacy in America today. The companies have no intention of supporting a privacy law that actually would stop them from collecting our information and give Americans the same rights the Europeans now have.\n\nProduced by Maria Gavrilovic.

Tom Marino, has withdrawn his name from consideration for the position.\n\nIn the midst of the worst drug epidemic in American history, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's ability to keep addictive opioids off U.S. streets was derailed -- that according to Joe Rannazzisi, one of the most important whistleblowers ever interviewed by 60 Minutes. Rannazzisi ran the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, the division that regulates and investigates the pharmaceutical industry. Now in a joint investigation by 60 Minutes and The Washington Post, Rannazzisi tells the inside story of how, he says, the opioid crisis was allowed to spread -- aided by Congress, lobbyists, and a drug distribution industry that shipped, almost unchecked, hundreds of millions of pills to rogue pharmacies and pain clinics providing the rocket fuel for a crisis that, over the last two decades, has claimed 200,000 lives.\n\nEx-DEA agent Joe Rannazzisi and 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker CBS News\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: This is an industry that's out of control. What they wanna do, is do what they wanna do, and not worry about what the law is. And if they don't follow the law in drug supply, people die. That's just it. People die.\n\n\"This is an industry that allowed millions and millions of drugs to go into bad pharmacies and doctors' offices, that distributed them out to people who had no legitimate need for those drugs.\"\n\nJoe Rannazzisi is a tough, blunt former DEA deputy assistant administrator with a law degree, a pharmacy degree and a smoldering rage at the unrelenting death toll from opioids. His greatest ire is reserved for the distributors -- some of them multibillion dollar, Fortune 500 companies. They are the middlemen that ship the pain pills from manufacturers, like Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson to drug stores all over the country. Rannazzisi accuses the distributors of fueling the opioid epidemic by turning a blind eye to pain pills being diverted to illicit use.\n\nMeet 60 Minutes' DEA whistleblower\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: This is an industry that allowed millions and millions of drugs to go into bad pharmacies and doctors' offices, that distributed them out to people who had no legitimate need for those drugs.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Who are these distributors?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: The three largest distributors are Cardinal Health, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen. They control probably 85 or 90 percent of the drugs going downstream.\n\nRannazzisi accuses distributors of fueling the opioid epidemic by turning a blind eye to pain pills being diverted to illicit use. CBS News\n\nBILL WHITAKER: You know the implication of what you're saying, that these big companies knew that they were pumping drugs into American communities that were killing people.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: That's not an implication, that's a fact. That's exactly what they did.\n\nIn the late 1990s, opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone became a routine medical treatment for chronic pain. Drug companies assured doctors and congressional investigators -- as in this 2001 hearing -- that the pain medications were effective and safe.\n\nPurdue Executive to Congress in 2001: Addiction is not common, addiction is rare in the pain patient who is properly managed.\n\nWith many doctors convinced the drugs posed few risks, prescriptions skyrocketed and so did addiction.\n\nEx-DEA agent Joe Rannazzisi and 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker CBS News\n\nMany people who'd become addicted to painkillers turned to shady pill mills -- pain clinics with rogue doctors to write fraudulent prescriptions and complicit pharmacists to fill them -- one-stop shopping for controlled narcotics.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: Pain clinics overnight popping-up \u2013 off an entrance ramp, or an exit ramp on an interstate. And all of a sudden there's a pain clinic there.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Had you ever seen anything like that before?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: Never. In fact-- it was my opinion that this made the whole crack epidemic look like nothing.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI These weren't kids slinging crack on the corner. These were professionals who were doing it. They were just drug dealers in lab coats.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: You know what a chilling picture that paints?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: I do, 'cause I watched them get arrested, and I was the one who approved the cases.\n\nDespite arrests of unscrupulous purveyors, opioids kept flooding the black market. The death toll kept rising. This map shows the U.S. death rate from drug overdose in 1999. By 2015, the map looked like this. Most of these deaths were opioid related. Joe Rannazzisi told us prosecuting crooked doctors and pharmacists wasn't stemming the epidemic, so he decided to move up the food chain.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: There had to be a choke point. And the choke point was the distributors.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: What took you so long to go to that choke point of the distributors?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: This was all new to us. We weren't seeing just some security violations, and a few bad orders. We were seeing hundreds of bad orders that involved millions and millions of tablets. That's when we started going after the distributors.\n\nEx-DEA agent Joe Rannazzisi CBS News\n\nA distributor's representative told us the problem is not distributors but doctors who overprescribe pain medication, but the distributors know exactly how many pills go to every drug store they supply. And they are required under the Controlled Substances Act to report and stop what the DEA calls \"suspicious orders\" -- such as unusually large or frequent shipments of opioids. But DEA investigators say many distributors ignored that requirement.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: They had a business plan. Their plan was to sell a lotta pills and make a lot of money. And they did both of those very well.\n\n\"All we were looking for is a good-faith effort by these companies to do the right thing. And there was no good-faith effort. Greed always trumped compliance. It did every time.\"\n\nJim Geldhof, a 40-year DEA veteran, ran pharmaceutical investigations from dea's detroit field office. Frank Younker supervised the agency's operations in Cincinnati. Joe Rannazzisi was their supervisor. They saw distributors shipping thousands of suspicious orders. One example: a pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, a town of just 392 people, ordered nine million hydrocodone pills over two years.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: All we were looking for is a good-faith effort by these companies to do the right thing. And there was no good-faith effort. Greed always trumped compliance. It did every time. But don't sit here and tell me that, \"Well, we're not sure what a suspicious order is.\" Really? I mean this-- this co-- this pharmacy just bought 50 times an amount that a normal pharmacy purchases and they are in a town of 5,000 people. You don't know that that's suspicious? I mean at some point you're just turning a blind eye to it.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: These companies are a big reason for this epidemic?\n\nJIM GELDHOF: Yeah, absolutely they are.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: And I can tell you with 100 percent accuracy that we were in there on multiple occasions trying to get them to change their behavior. And they just flat out ignored us.\n\nIn 2008, the DEA slapped McKesson, the country's largest drug distributor, with a $13.2 million dollar fine. That same year, Cardinal Health paid a $34 million fine. Both companies were penalized by the DEA for filling hundreds of suspicious orders -- millions of pills.\n\nOver the last seven years, distributors' fines have totaled more than $341 million. The companies cried foul and complained to Congress that DEA regulations were vague and the agency was treating them like a foreign drug cartel. In a letter, the healthcare distribution alliance, which represents distributors, told us they wanted to work with the DEA. Effective enforcement, they wrote, \"must be a two-way street.\"\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Frank, you said you were tough but fair. The industry says you guys were unfair. That you were taking unfair hits at them.\n\nFRANK YOUNKER: Tell that to the people who lost their sons and daughters. See how fair they think it is.\n\nIn 2011, more than 17,000 Americans died from opioid prescription overdoses. That same year Cardinal Health, the second largest distributor, started pushing back at Joe Rannazzisi. The companies' attorneys went over his head and called his bosses at the Justice Department, who called in Rannazzisi to have him explain his tactics.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: And it in-- infuriated me that I was over there, trying to explain what my motives were or why I was going after these corporations? And when I went back to the office, and I sat down with my staff, I basically said, \"You know, I just got questioned on why we're doing-- why we're doing what we're doing. This is-- this-- this is-- now this is war. We're going after these people and we're not going to stop.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Do you really think you were getting this pushback because you were going after big companies, Fortune 500 companies?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: I have no doubt in my mind. So the question is, why would it be any different for these companies as compared to the small mom-and-pops that we had done hundreds of times before.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: What's the difference?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: The difference is, is they have a lot of money, and a lot of influence. And that's the difference.\n\nRannazzisi says the drug industry used that money and influence to pressure top lawyers at the DEA to take a softer approach. Former DEA attorney Jonathan Novak said it divided the litigation office. He said in 2013, he noticed a sea change in the way prosecutions of big distributors were handled. Cases his supervisors once would have easily approved, now weren't good enough.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: We had been achieving incredible success in an almost unstoppable wave, and then suddenly it stopped.\n\nNovak prosecuted cases brought to him by Joe Rannazzisi's investigators. He said his caseload started to slow down dramatically.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: These were not cases where it was black -- where it was grey... These were cases where the evidence was crystal clear that there was wrongdoing going on.\n\nHe said his bosses started to bog down the system, demanding ever more evidence.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: But now, three undercovers by four officers over three months, that wouldn't be enough. Maybe we need an expert to explain how recording equipment works. Maybe we need an expert to explain-- the system for prescribing. What's a prescription? It felt honestly confusing and almost insane. Where was this coming from?\n\nJim Geldhof says his investigations were getting bogged down too. He was looking into one mid-sized distributor that had shipped more than 28 million pain pills to pharmacies in West Virginia over five years. About 11 million of those pills wound up in Mingo County, population 25,000. Suddenly, he said, he ran into roadblocks from one of attorney Jonathan Novak's bosses.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: \"I spent a year working on this case. I sent it down there and it's never good enough. Every time I talked to this guy he wants something else. And I get it for 'em and that's still not good enough.\" You know? And this goes on and on and on. When this-- these roadblocks keep-- get thrown up in your face, at that point you know they just don't want the case.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: But this is the DEA. That's what you're supposed to do.\n\nFRANK YOUNKER: Yeah.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: You would think.\n\nThe DEA's toughest sanction is to freeze distributors shipments of narcotics -- a step they haven't taken in almost two years.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: I mean there's no denying the numbers. At the height of the opioid epidemic, inexplicably, they slowed down.\n\nHe said one big reason for the slowdown: DC's notorious revolving door. Novak said he saw a parade of DEA lawyers switch sides and jump to high-paying jobs defending the drug industry. Once they'd made the leap, they lobbied their former colleagues, novak's bosses, and argued the dea's cases were weak and ultimately would lose in court. It had a chilling effect on dea litigators.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: Some of the best and the brightest former DEA attorneys are now on the other side and know all of the -- the -- the weak points. Their fingerprints are on, memos and policy and -- and -- and emails going out where you see this concoction of what they might argue in the future.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: You and the other attorneys had been winning these cases.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: All of the time.\n\nThe Justice Department is the agency that oversees the DEA. A senior attorney at the department at the time, told us in a statement, ''Department of Justice leadership was not advised that DEA had changed enforcement strategies...Any significant policy shift should have been brought to [our] attention.''\n\nFRANK YOUNKER: There was a lotta pills, a lotta people dyin', and-- and we had tools in our toolbox to try to use and stem that flow. But it seemed down in headquarters that that toolbox was shut off.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: You're watching an out of control epidemic and yet you both feel that at the height of this epidemic your-- your-- your hands were being tied?\n\nFRANK YOUNKER: Yeah, if it's a war on drugs then treat it like a war.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: Addiction rate was still increasing. The amount of people seeking treatment was still increasing. It was all increasing. Still, the amount of prescriptions were increasing. And we started slowing down.\n\nAs cases nearly ground to a halt at DEA, the drug industry began lobbying Congress for legislation that would destroy DEA's enforcement powers. That part of the story when we return.\n\nIn 2013, Joe Rannazzisi and his DEA investigators were trying to crack down on big drug distributors that ship drugs to pharmacies across the country. He accused them of turning a blind eye as millions of prescription pain pills ended up on the black market. Then, a new threat surfaced on Capitol Hill. With the help of members of Congress, the drug industry began to quietly pave the way for legislation that essentially would strip the DEA of its most potent tool in fighting the spread of dangerous narcotics.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: If I was gonna write a book about how to harm the United States with pharmaceuticals, the only thing I could think of that would immediately harm is to take the authority away from the investigative agency that is trying to enforce the Controlled Substances Act and the regulations implemented under the act. And that's what this bill did.\n\nThe bill, introduced in the House by Pennsylvania Congressman Tom Marino and Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, was promoted as a way to ensure that patients had access to the pain medication they needed.\n\nJonathan Novak, who worked in the DEA's legal office, says what the bill really did was strip the agency of its ability to immediately freeze suspicious shipments of prescription narcotics to keep drugs off U.S. streets -- what the DEA calls diversion.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: You're not gonna be able to hold anyone higher up the food chain accountable.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Because of this law?\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: Because of this law\n\nBILL WHITAKER: How hard does it make your job in going after the wholesale distributors?\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: I would say it makes it nearly impossible.\n\nThis 2015, Justice Department memo we obtained supports that. It states the bill \"could actually result in increased diversion, abuse, and public health and safety consequences.\"\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: They are toothless. I don't know how they stop this now. It's a very sad state of affairs.\n\nWho drafted the legislation that would have such a dire effect? The answer came in another internal Justice Department email released to 60 Minutes and The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act: \"Linden Barber used to work for the DEA. He wrote the Marino bill.\"\n\nAd: Hi, My name is Linden Barber. I'm the director of the DEA litigation and compliance practice at Quarles and Brady's Health Law Group.\n\nBarber went through the revolving door. He left his job as associate chief counsel of the DEA and within a month joined a law firm where he lobbied Congress on behalf of drug companies and wrote legislation. He advertised what he could offer a client facing DEA scrutiny.\n\nAd continued: If you have a DEA compliance issue, or you're facing a government investigation, or you're having administrative or civil litigation involving the Controlled Substances Act, I'd be happy to hear from you.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: It's not surprising that this bill, that has intimate knowledge of the way that DEA, you know, regulations are enforced, the way that those laws work, was written by someone who spent a lot of time there, charged a lot of cases there.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Knew the workings?\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: Very much so.\n\nEric Holder was the attorney general at the time, he warned the new law would undermine law enforcement efforts to ''prevent communities and families from falling prey to dangerous drugs.'' The major drug companies -- distributors, chain drug stores and pharmaceutical manufacturers -- mobilized too. According to federal filings, during the two years the legislation was considered and amended, they spent $106 million lobbying Congress on the bill and other legislation, claiming the DEA was out of control, making it harder for patients to get needed medication.\n\nA particular thorn for the drug industry and the bill's sponsors was Joe Rannazzisi. He had been a witness before Congress more than 30 times and was called on again to testify about this bill.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: 16,651 people in 2010 died of opiate overdose. OK. Opiate-associated overdose. This is not a game. We are not playing a game.\n\nMARSHA BLACKBURN: Nobody is saying it is a game, sir. We're just trying to craft some legislation. Let me ask you...\n\nRannazzisi, who admits to having a temper, felt so strongly about the damage the bill could do, he lashed out at Marino's committee staffers.\n\nTOM MARINO: It is my understanding that Joe Rannazzisi, a senior DEA official, has publicly accused we sponsors of the bill of --quote supporting criminals --unquote. This offends me immensely.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Congressman Marino from Pennsylvania said that you accused him of helping criminals.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: I've never accused Congressman Marino of helping criminals. I said that this bill is going to protect defendants that we have under investigation. And if Congressman Marino thinks I accused him of something, I don't know what to tell you.\n\nBut a week after the hearing on legislation that would hobble the DEA's enforcement authority, Marino and Blackburn wrote the inspector general for the Justice Department, demanding that Rannazzisi be investigated for trying to quote \"intimidate the United States Congress.\"\n\nMATT MURPHY: There were people in industry that didn't care much for Joe Ranazzisi, wanted him silenced, or wanted him outta the way. Basically unceremoniously kick him to the curb.\n\nAfter almost 30 years with the DEA, Matt Murphy, Rannazzisi's lieutenant, became a consultant for the drug industry -- an industry with which he's now disillusioned. He said he was shocked at the animosity he witnessed toward his friend and former boss.\n\nMATT MURPHY: My theory is that the industry through lobbying groups donated -- a certain amount of money to politicians to get a law passed that favored the industry. And also maybe using those political ties to have Joe removed.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Congress launched an investigation of him?\n\nMATT MURPHY: Right.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: And he was out?\n\nMATT MURPHY: Yeah, pressure was put on for him to be moved out. I'm pretty confident of that. There was no reason to take the guy who was the most qualified person in DEA to run the Office of Diversion Control out of the Office of Diversion Control.\n\nThe investigation requested by Congressman Marino against Rannazzisi went nowhere, but soon after, Rannazzisi was stripped of his responsibilities. He says he went from supervising 600 people to supervising none -- so he resigned.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: We were totally focused on all these people dying and all these drugs being diverted. And we were not really looking at our flanks, waiting for somebody to come after us. So maybe that was my fault. And I just never realized that that was something that would have occurred.\n\nIn the end, the DEA signed off on the final version of the \"Marino bill.\" A senior DEA representative told us the agency fought hard to stop it, but in the face of growing pressure from Congress and industry lobbyists, was forced to accept a deal it did not want. The bill was presented to the Senate in March of 2016.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell brought the legislation to the floor and it passed the Senate through unanimous consent with no objections and no recorded votes.\n\nIt passed the House the same way, with members of Congress chatting away on the floor.\n\nA week later, with no objections from Congress or the DEA, President Barack Obama signed it into law without ceremony or the usual bill signing photo-op. Marino issued a press release the next day claiming credit for the legislation.\n\nThe drug distributors declared victory and told us the new law would in no way limit DEA's enforcement abilities. But DEA chief administrative law judge, John J. Mulrooney, who must adjudicate the law, wrote in a soon-to-be-published Marquette Law Review article we obtained, that the new legislation \"would make it all but...impossible\" to prosecute unscrupulous distributors.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: I just don't understand why Congress would pass a bill that strips us of our authority in the height of an opioid epidemic in places like Congressman Marino's district and Congressman Blackburn's district. Why are these people sponsoring bills, when people in their backyards are dying from drugs that are coming from the same people that these bills are protecting?\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Why do you think that is?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: Because I think that the drug industry -- the manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and chain drugstores -- have an influence over Congress that has never been seen before. And these people came in with their influence and their money and got a whole statute changed because they didn't like it.\n\nSeven months after the bill became law, Congressman Marino's point man on the legislation, his Chief of Staff Bill Tighe, became a lobbyist for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.\n\nSince the crackdown on the distributors began, the pharmaceutical industry and law firms that represent them have hired at least 46 investigators, attorneys and supervisors from the DEA, including 32 directly from the division that regulates the drug industry.\n\nMike Gill, chief of staff for the DEA administrator, was hired by HDJN, one of the country's largest healthcare law firms.\n\nAnd most recently, Jason Hadges, a senior DEA attorney overseeing enforcement cases during the slowdown, joined the pharmaceutical and regulatory division of DC-based law firm Hogan Lovells. He declined to speak with us.\n\nAmerisourceBergen and McKesson declined our requests to appear on camera.\n\nSo did Cardinal Health, which three months ago hired the author of the bill, Linden Barber, as senior vice president. With Scott Higham and Lenny Bernstein of the Washington Post, we called the head of public relations of Cardinal and asked to speak with Barber.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: This is Bill Whitaker I'm a correspondent with 60 Minutes, I was calling to see if, um, we could speak with Linden Barber.\n\nWe were told the company would not make him available.\n\nWe also tried for several months to speak to Congressman Marino. Finally, we went to his DC office.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Hello. I'm Bill Whitaker with, uh, 60 Minutes.\n\nMARINO STAFFER: Yes.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: And we'd like to speak with Congressman Marino if we could.\n\nMARINO STAFFER: I'm going to have to refer you to our Chief of Staff.\n\nWe were told he was not available...\n\nMARINO CHIEF OF STAFF: Can you please turn the camera off and we have to ask the camera to leave the office.\n\nHis staff then called the Capitol Hill Police on us.\n\nCAPITOL POLICE: Just accept the uninvite and leave the area.\n\nWhen Joe Rannazzisi looks back he has one regret.\n\nJoe Rannazzisi: You know all these people that died happened under my watch. The one thing I wanted to do, the one thing that I just thought would have the most impact, is to lock up, arrest one of these corporate officers. You arrest a corporate officer. You arrest somebody that's involved in the decision process, knowing what the law is. If you make that arrest, then everybody sits up and takes notice because three-piece-suit guys just don't do well in prison. They don't.\n\nJoe Rannazzissi now consults with state attorneys general who have filed suit against distributors for their role in the opioid crisis. Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn is running for the Senate. As for Congressman Marino, he was just nominated to be President Donald Trump's new drug czar.\n\nCorrection: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought the Marino bill to the Senate floor where it passed. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Sen. McConnell introduced the bill.\n\nProduced by Sam Hornblower and Ira Rosen. Alex J.

Science doesn't know enough about the brain to make sense of Alma. Alma Deutscher is an accomplished British composer in the classical style. She is a virtuoso on the piano and the violin. And she is 12 years old. She's different from other prodigies we have known, because at the age of ten she wrote an opera, which demands comprehensive mastery; not just how to play the piano, but, what is the range of the oboe? What can a cellist play? We don't know how she understands it all. It seems that Alma was born that way.\n\nCorrespondent Scott Pelley and Alma Deutscher CBS News\n\nScott Pelley: What is your earliest musical memory?\n\nAlma Deutscher: I remember that when I was three, and I listened to this really beautiful lullaby by Richard Strauss, and that was when I really first realized how much I loved music. And I asked my parents, \"But how can music be so beautiful?\"\n\nThose notes of Richard Strauss ignited a universe. At three, Alma was playing piano and violin.\n\nScott Pelley: When did the composing begin?\n\nAlma Deutscher: When I was four, I just had these melodies and ideas in my head, and I would play them down at the piano. And sometimes my parents would think that I was just remembering music that I'd already heard before. But I said, \"No, no, these are my melodies, that I composed.\"\n\n\"For me, it's strange to walk around and not to have melodies popping into my head.\"\n\nThis past summer, in Austria, we watched Alma prepare her violin concerto and the premiere of her piano concerto. Joji Hattori conducts the vienna chamber orchestra.\n\nThat night, the soloist was the composer herself. Remember, she wrote all the notes for all the instruments.\n\nWe could see, Alma was living a story.\n\nA story of loss.\n\nA story of redemption.\n\nScales of emotion beyond a child.\n\nAnd yet her vision was almost like wisdom.\n\nScott Pelley: Do you have any idea where this comes from?\n\nAlma Deutscher: I don't really know, but it's really very normal to me to go around -- walk around and having melodies popping into my head. It's the most normal thing in the world. For me, it's strange to walk around and not to have melodies popping into my head. So if I was interviewing you, I would say, \"Well, tell me Scott. How does it feel not having melodies popping into your head?\n\nScott Pelley: It's very quiet in my head. I must say.\n\nAlma Deutscher CBS News\n\nBut, it appears, it's never quiet in hers. When she has nothing to do, the music flows from its mysterious source as fluently as breath.\n\nHer parents, Guy and Janie, are professors. She teaches old English literature, Guy is a noted linguist. Both of them are amateur musicians.\n\nScott Pelley: Do you feel that there's anything about Alma's gift that you don't understand?\n\nGuy Deutscher: We don't understand creativity. Does anyone? I mean I think that's the crux of the mystery. Where does it come from? This melody popping into your head. It really is a volcano of imagination. It's almost unstoppable.\n\nIt was Guy who taught her how to read music.\n\nGuy Deutscher: I thought I was an amazing teacher because you know, I hardly had to--\n\nScott Pelley: You thought it was you!\n\nGuy Deutscher: I thought it was me. I hardly had to say something and you know her piano teacher once said 'it's a bit difficult with Alma It's difficult to teach her because one always has the sense she'd been there before.'\n\nJanie Deutscher: She wouldn't be able to imagine life without dreams and stories and music. That's as unimaginable to her as it is strange for other people to think about a girl with melodies in her head.\n\nAlma Deutscher: I love getting the melodies. It's not at all difficult to me. I get them all the time. But then actually sitting down and developing the melodies and that's the really difficult part, having to tell a real story with music.\n\n\"I think I would prefer to be the first Alma than to be the second Mozart.\"\n\nThe story Alma tells in her opera, is Cinderella, but it's not the Cinderella you know.\n\nIt seemed demeaning to Alma that Cinderella was attractive because her feet were small so she cast Cinderella as a composer and the prince, as a poet.\n\nAlma Deutscher: Cinderella finds a poem that was composed by the prince and she loves it and she's inspired to put music to it. And in the ball she sings it to the prince.\n\nAlma Deutscher CBS News\n\nAlma Deutscher: I think that it makes much more sense if he falls in love with her because she composed this amazing melody to his poem, because he thinks that she's his soul mate, because he understands her.\n\nScott Pelley: Well, people can fall in love with composers.\n\nAlma Deutscher: Exactly.\n\nScott Pelley: I think this may be one of those times.\n\nThey fell in love with Cinderella in its first production in Vienna.\n\nScott Pelley: There is another composer who had an opera premiere in Vienna at the age of 11. Mozart. People compare you to Mozart. What do you think of that?\n\nAlma Deutscher: I know that they mean it to be very nice to compare me to Mozart.\n\nScott Pelley: It could be worse.\n\nAlma Deutscher: Of course, I love Mozart and I would have loved him to be my teacher. But I think I would prefer to be the first Alma than to be the second Mozart.\n\nIn Israel, Mozart joined Alma on stage, she played his piano concerto with a cadenza. In a cadenza, the orchestra stops and the soloist breaks away in music of her own making.\n\nAlma Deutscher: It's something that I composed because you see it's a very early concerto of Mozart and the cadenza was very simple. It didn't go to any different keys.\n\nAlma Deutscher: And I composed quite a long one going to lots and lots of different keys doing lots of things in Mozart's motifs.\n\nScott Pelley: So you improved the cadenza of Mozart?\n\nAlma Deutscher: Well, yes.\n\nWatch a prodigy create -- from four notes in a hat\n\nRobert Gjerdingen is a professor of music at Northwestern in Chicago. He has been a consultant to Alma's education.\n\nRobert Gjerdingen: It's kind of a comet that goes by and everybody looks up and just goes, \"Wow.\" I sent her some assignments when she was six, seven, where I expected her to crash and burn, because they were very difficult. It came back, it was like listening to a mid-18th century composer. She was a native speaker.\n\nScott Pelley: A native speaker?\n\nRobert Gjerdingen: It's her first language she speaks the Mozart-style. She speaks the style of Mendelssohn.\n\nScott Pelley: And the names that you just mentioned are the ones that live for centuries.\n\nRobert Gjerdingen: Yes. She's batting in the big leagues. And if you win the pennant, there's immortality.\n\nThe route to immortality leads through California. In December, the Opera San Jose Orchestra will stage Cinderella in Alma's American debut. She'll be the belle of the ball, on the piano, organ and violin.\n\nAlma Deutscher CBS News\n\nAlma Deutscher: The piano music teachers say, \"Well you must choose the piano.\" And the violin music teachers say, \"Oh you must choose the violin.\" But anyway, that's better than the piano teacher saying, \"You must choose the violin.\"\n\nScott Pelley: That would be a bad sign.\n\nAlma Deutscher: That would be a bad sign, yes.\n\n\"I know that that life is not always beautiful. That there's also ugliness in the world. That's why I, I've learned, that I want to write beautiful music because I want to make the world a better place.\"\n\nFortunately she doesn't have to choose. This is her composition, Violin Concerto Number One.\n\nAlma Deutscher: It's extremely jolly and very happy and jocular that movement. I want to make the people who listen to it laugh and be happy. The first movement of the violin concerto is quite the opposite. It's very dark and dramatic.\n\nScott Pelley: What does a girl your age know about dark and dramatic?\n\nAlma Deutscher: Well yes, that's an interesting question because you know what? I'm a very happy person so I have lots of imaginary composers. And one of them is called Antonin Yellowsink.\n\nAntonin Yellowsink, Alma's imaginary composing friend, is an insight into the music of her mind. Alma told us that she made up a country where imaginary composers write, each in his own style of emotion.\n\nScott Pelley: So how many composers do you have in your head?\n\nAlma Deutscher: I have lots of composers. And sometimes when I'm stuck with something, when I'm composing, I go to them and ask them for advice. And quite often, they come up with very interesting things.\n\nEven the real world is magical. The Deutscher's moved to the English countryside to be near a famous school of music. Alma is privately tutored and homeschooled alongside her sister Helen who also knows her way around the piano and the tree house.\n\nScott Pelley: I usually don't ask people your age this question, but, what have you learned about life?\n\nAlma Deutscher: Well, I know that that life is not always beautiful. That there's also ugliness in the world. That's why I, I've learned, that I want to write beautiful music because I want to make the world a better place.\n\nWe cannot know how Alma Deutscher channels her music like a portal in time. But in a world, too often ugly, and too often overburdened with explanation, it's nice to take a moment and wonder.\n\nProduced by Robert G.

He's trying to photograph every species, every animal, bird, fish, reptile and insect, in captivity. Sartore sides with scientists who estimate half the species alive today could be extinct by the end of this century. So he travels to zoos around the world to take pictures of what we're losing and to ignite conservation efforts to prevent extinctions. He calls his project: The Photo Ark.\n\n\"Emotion. That's what you look for in any in any great photograph.\"\n\nOn this ark, the animals go in one by one\n\nTo catch Joel Sartore in action, we flew halfway around the world to the Philippines, home to hundreds of unique species.\n\nBill Whitaker: Flew 20 hours to get here. And you came all this way to take a picture of a Palawan Stink Badger?\n\nJoel Sartore: Absolutely. Absolutely. He's smaller than a skunk but smells worse.\n\nHe's part-badger, part-skunk and he fired a reeking rocket after he entered the photo cage.\n\nThe Palawan stink badger CBS News\n\nIt smelled so terrible that the next animal to leave the red carpet and head into the photo cage, a rare Palawan Binturong, took one whiff, smelled stink badger stink and backed out.\n\nSartore said he should have photographed the stink badger last, but the little stinker is a pungent prize.\n\nJoel Sartore: There's nobody else coming along to photograph a stink badger. I'm the only one. And that's the case for 90 percent of the species I photograph, maybe 95 percent. These are things that nobody will ever know existed if it weren't for the Photo Ark. If they could see how beautiful this thing is they would care.\n\nJoel cares so much he spends half the year traveling the world. We saw him work 12-hour days in stifling, humid, hundred degree heat.\n\nIt was tough for us just watching him build pop-up studios, switching between backdrops of black and white.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why did you decide to use either black or white backgrounds?\n\nJoel Sartore: There are no distractions in these pictures. It's just the animal and you. And that animal's often looking you in the eye.\n\nThat's when it all works. Here's what happened years ago when Joel tried to photograph a chimp. He spent more than an hour taping up the white background.\n\nMore than an hour, for this.\n\nAnimals can be frustrating and dangerous, like this fierce Luzon Warty Pig, found only on a few Philippine islands. Handlers had herded him into a makeshift photo pen. Joel got as close as he dared, lying in a trough usually used for pig waste.\n\n\"National Geographic\" photographer Joel Sartore CBS News\n\nBill Whitaker: The tusks are sharp. The hooves are sharp--\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah. I, I you know what? I'm concentrating. I got a lot to do.\n\nBeyond the tusks and hooves, this pig packs a mean temper. You've heard the expression: when pigs fly? Watch...\n\nJoel Sartore: Like a cow jumping over the moon, except it was a pig. I've never had that happen, ever. We got our picture. We don't ever need to photograph this species again.\n\nBut then, there was Trixie, perhaps the world's sweetest orangutan. We met her not far from the mean-spirited pig at the Avilon Zoo outside Manila.\n\nThe key question: would Trixie move in front of the white background?\n\nJoel Sartore: Do You think she would want to stand over there? And get her picture.\n\nBill Whitaker: She's amazing.\n\nJoel Sartore: Awesome, look at that.\n\nEllen Sartore: Aw sweet girl.\n\nBill Whitaker: Covergirl.\n\nJoel Sartore: If she lays down to look at you, you get down with her. You just lay down on the ground and eye level. She was completely calm.\n\nSartore and correspondent Bill Whitaker with Trixie CBS News\n\nLater, Sartore showed us his favorites Trixie shots, at \"National Geographic\" headquarters in Washington.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what do you think she's thinking?\n\nJoel Sartore: I think she was just thinking, you know, \"Is there a banana in this somewhere for me? (laugh) A mango?\"\n\nJoel Sartore: I like the white one better I think. It's more direct. It's more like she's involved. She's a partner in the process.\n\nBill Whitaker: I put my hand out. I wasn't quite sure she was going to take it. But she did.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah, it's soft.\n\nBill Whitaker: And it was soft. Yeah, that was an amazing experience.\n\nBill Whitaker: What makes a great picture?\n\nJoel Sartore: Emotion. That's what you look for in any in any great photograph.\n\nBill Whitaker: What's emotion in an animal\u2014\n\nJoel Sartore: A moment. We're looking for the eyes. Humans are we're primates, and we're really really responsive to eyes. We're all about eye contact.\n\nBill Whitaker: But you shoot 'em like they're models.\n\nJoel Sartore: We do. Like they're going in for their high school senior portrait.\n\nSartore shoots birds in tents so they won't fly away. This White-Crowned Hornbill, posed like a preening pro. Completely different from Joel's first attempt to shoot this species, back in the states.\n\nJoel Sartore: So this lady, her name's Jen. What she didn't tell me is that bird is such a badass he attacks her when he goes in to feed him.\n\nJoel Sartore: So when I said, \"Can you put that bird in my tent?\" She went, \"Sure I can.\"\n\nThat's why he wanted to shoot a calm hornbill in the Philippines.\n\nOnce snake bitten, but not camera shy\n\nBut here the Red Rat Snake kept attacking.\n\nFortunately, he's not venomous, since he bit our cameraman Mark LaGanga.\n\nJoel Sartore: I enjoy seeing a 60 Minutes cameraman get bit instead of me.\n\nBut the next snake was extremely venomous.\n\nThe Palawan Spitting Cobra can blind you if it spits in your eye and it can spit ten feet. That's why Joel wore goggles. But watch how close he gets to this cobra.\n\nSartore shoots the Palawan spitting cobra CBS News\n\nBill Whitaker: I always thought when they had their hood out like that that meant danger.\n\nJoel Sartore: Well he's reacting to us. We're like skyscrapers to this guy. So he's gonna stand up and look as big as he can.\n\nIn zoos Sartore can shoot more than 20 species in one day. In the wild it could take several days to get one good shot. Now, with natural habitats vanishing, some species can only be found in zoos.\n\nJoel Sartore: A lot of 'em only exist in zoos. They have these captive breeding programs for some of the rarest animals in the world. So when people say well, they're down on zoos. Well they haven't seen a good zoo and they don't know the conservation effect of good zoos.\n\nSartore spent his first 16 years at \"National Geographic\" taking pictures in the field. He scored numerous magazine covers, and endured various hardships.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah. That's me. That's on Alaska's north slope. I wanted to show the insect load up there. And also I hadn't made a good picture in three days. And so the editors here will say, \"Joel, we can't publish your excuses.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: The mosquitoes though my god. That's incredible.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah. My feet itched for a long time.\n\nHe came up with the Photo Ark idea after his wife developed breast cancer.\n\nJoel Sartore: That's my son Cole, and my wife Kathy. She went on chemo for nine months. And I was grounded. I was home for a year. And so I was really worried she was not gonna make it. But we all made it through. She's fine today, it's been 13 years, which is great.\n\nBill Whitaker: Wonderful.\n\nJoel Sartore: It really does make you appreciate how limited our time is.\n\nBill Whitaker: So the cancer changed all of your lives.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah. And started the Photo Ark. It was a desperate, last-ditch effort to use my life for something that's worthwhile, something that could save nature.\n\nBill Whitaker: In the Bible, the ark saves all the creatures on Earth. Is that your goal?\n\nJoel Sartore: Exactly. Giddy up. You bet.\n\nBill Whitaker: What makes you think you can save them with a photo?\n\nJoel Sartore: We can reach more people now than ever. Because we can post to \"National Geographic,\" Instagram and Facebook and reach over 100 million people, and do it again and again and again.\n\nHis latest pictures are published periodically and they've appeared on the Empire State Building, and the Vatican.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah, the side of St Peter's Basilica. The Pope was sittin' there watchin' it, which was awesome.\n\nWe flew with Joel to the island of Negros. Here, vast forests were cut for timber, robbing wildlife of vital habitat.\n\nJoel Sartore: Now there's hardly any lowland forest left, less than 5 percent here.\n\nNegros has its own type of critically endangered warty pig. This mother was saved from a hunter's snare. In the zoo, she's helping to save her species.\n\nJoel Sartore: She's got her babies. And you see that bridle marking on her snout that's really definitive.\n\nBill Whitaker: Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's beautiful.\n\n\"At least my life'll be spent doing something that's hopefully mattered to the world\"\n\nJoel, who spends so much time away from home, brought his daughter Ellen on this trip.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what do you think of what he's doing?\n\nEllen Sartore: I think it's extraordinary, what you're doing.\n\nJoel Sartore: Really?\n\nEllen Sartore: I do.\n\nJoel Sartore: Aww. You're gonna make me cry.\n\nEllen Sartore: Don't cry. (laugh)\n\nJoel Sartore: I've never heard you say that. You do?\n\nEllen Sartore: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: But he is gone all the time?\n\nEllen Sartore: He hasn't been to the last seven of my birthdays just because my birthday is in migration season. So he's\u2014\n\nBill Whitaker: Migration season? (laugh)\n\nJoel Sartore: It's true.\n\nBill Whitaker: So that's a birthday-buster.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah.\n\nThe next day Sartore showed us a beetle he had spotted. A species he hadn't shot before.\n\nBill Whitaker: So there's nothing too small for you huh?\n\nJoel Sartore: Nothing to small. If you can see it with your eyes. We'll photograph it.\n\nBill Whitaker: How big is this guy?\n\nJoel Sartore: Oh, that guy is the size of a grain of rice.\n\nBill Whitaker: Tiny.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yea tiny.\n\nBill Whitaker: So every animal fills up your frame?\n\nJoel Sartore: That's right.\n\nBill Whitaker: Small or large.\n\nJoel Sartore: He's as big as a polar bear.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why do you do that?\n\nJoel Sartore: Because it gives 'em all equal say, equal voice. The big, charismatic mammals get all the ink. They get all the press, the gorillas and the rhinos and the tigers. Nobody's thinkin' about these little guys. I am.\n\nSartore shot another little guy, believed to be the very last member of a now extinct species.\n\nJoel Sartore: That's the last Rabbs Fringe Limbed Frog.\n\nBill Whitaker: What's that like, knowing that this animal will not exist anymore shortly after you take the picture?\n\nJoel Sartore: Well does it make me sad? Sure. But does it inspire me to go out and keep workin' like I do? Absolutely.\n\nJoel Sartore: We put this together in my office. This just shows you what rodents can look like and what parrots look like. Biodiversity in-- in a glance. Just primates.\n\nBill Whitaker: Wow.\n\nJoel Sartore: And we've done a lot more since then. We can go out farther and farther and farther. Hundreds of species. Thousands of species. Just amphibians. There's so much diversity but you'd never know it.

Kevin Cooper's case has drawn worldwide attention, including from Pope Francis and Kim Kardashian West. The heartbreaking story about the brutal assault that left four dead and one young survivor in Chino Hills, Calif., also raises questions about the initial police investigation, the loss of key evidence, and whether someone else is actually the killer.\n\n\"Nearly 20 years ago, I got a stack of letters from an inmate at San Quentin Prison,\" \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty reports. \"His name is Kevin Cooper \u2013 and he wrote that he had been framed, as he put it, 'for something that I didn't do.'\"\n\nMoriarty and \"48 Hours\" began exploring the case, the investigation, and Cooper's claims of innocence when she got the letters, and her reporting continues to this day.\n\nIn 1983, someone brutally murdered Doug and Peggy Ryen, their daughter Jessica, 10, and a family friend, Christopher Hughes, 11. Josh Ryen, then 8, was the only survivor.\n\nPolice were under pressure to find the killer, and the community was terrified. Almost two months after the murders, Kevin Cooper, a convicted burglar who had escaped a nearby minimum security prison, was arrested and charged with the killings.\n\n\"I cannot take responsibility for murders I did not commit,\" says Cooper, who was convicted of killing four people and the attempted murder of another. He was sentenced to death.\n\n\"You have a sensational crime,\" says New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, \"and also a case tainted with racism.\"\n\nIn 2002, post-conviction DNA testing did not exonerate Cooper, but it raised significant issues with the process. Cooper was scheduled to die in February 2004, but the 9th Circuit federal appellate court stepped in and stayed the execution. Cooper finally got his wish for additional testing on Christmas Eve 2018. The testing hasn't occurred yet.\n\nWill new DNA technology free Cooper? Or will it just solidify what prosecutors believe \u2013 that Cooper was the killer? Moreover, what about other possible suspects, including Lee Furrow, a paroled killer that Cooper's defense team believes is responsible? Furrow told Moriarty in 2000 he had \"nothing to do with any of this.\"\n\nMASSACRE IN CHINO HILLS\n\n\n\nIn 1983, on a ranch surrounded by beautiful rolling hills, a savage massacre took place.\n\nNEWS REPORT: The Ryens and neighborhood boy Christopher Hughes were found hacked and stabbed to death.\n\nPaul Ingels: It's a very affluent community. There's a lot of ranches up there, a lot of horse owners. This is upper middle class, virtually crime free \u2026 it shook the community.\n\nIt shocked law enforcement as well. Back in 1983, Paul Ingels was a detective in a neighboring county.\n\nPaul Ingels: We're talking about four people brutally murdered in one room, and coming across that, it was just astonishing for the deputies that arrived there.\n\nErin Moriarty: Would you say it's among the most brutal cases you've ever had to deal with?\n\nFloyd Tidwell: Yeah, mm-hmm. \u2026On a scale of one to 10 it was a 10.\n\nAt the time, Floyd Tidwell was sheriff of San Bernardino County.\n\nFloyd Tidwell: Seemed to be a frenzy involved in the killing. \u2026it gave you that impression by the amount of activity that took place there. It made you think that there had to be more than one person to do all of this. \u2026and then we got information \u2026 three men had been seen at the house that day \u2026 we thought maybe that was the answer to it.\n\nAs bloody as the crime scene was, in 1983, forensic testing was limited -- and there was little evidence left behind. Nothing was taken from the Ryen home, except the family's station wagon.\n\nFloyd Tidwell: A lot of people were going out and buying guns in the community \u2026 People were scared to death.\n\nOn June 4, 1983, Doug and Peggy Ryen and their daughter Jessica were brutally murdered in their Chino Hills, Calif. home. Christopher Hughes, an 11-year-old neighbor who was spending the night, was also killed. Mary Howell/Hughes Family\n\nWith good reason. It was hard enough to understand why Doug and Peggy Ryen would be so viciously butchered, but who would slash and kill children? Their 10-year-old daughter Jessica Ryen and 11-year-old neighbor Chris Hughes, who was spending the night. Eight-and-a-half-year-old Josh Ryen, the only survivor, was barely alive when he was rushed to the hospital.\n\nErin Moriarty: How would you describe that time for you and Josh?\n\nMary Howell: It was horrible, very horrible.\n\nHis maternal grandmother, Mary Howell, told \"48 Hours\" back in 2000, that she never left his side.\n\nMary Howell: His head was all bandaged, and the little kid couldn't talk. \u2026 but he wrote on a paper, \"How's Mom and Dad?\" \u2026 And I had to tell Josh that, \"Mom and Dad and Jessica are dead.\" \u2026 So, he just cried and says, \"Why didn't I die, too? I want to be with them.\"\n\nErin Moriarty: And what did you say to him?\n\nMary Howell: Well, I just -- felt like 1,000 knives were cuttin' through me. Wasn't easy. But \u2026 I just had to be up for Josh. \u2026 if I break down too that wouldn't be good for Josh.\n\nBut once she was alone, Howell says, the tears never stopped.\n\nMary Howell: I cried from the minute I left the hospital 'til I got home. Cried all night, cried all next day, all the way to work. \u2026Did that for a year.\n\n\"This was gonna be their Christmas card,\" said Mary Howell of the Ryen family. Pictured from left: Josh, Jessica, Peggy and Doug. Josh was the sole survivor of the deadly attack. Mary Howell\n\nHowell's daughter Peggy and son-in-law Doug had followed her into the family business. They were all chiropractors, and like Mary, the Ryens also raised Arabian horses.\n\nMary Howell: Peggy \u2026 loved horses. So did Jessica.\n\nMary Howell [looking at photos]: That was Jessica's colt.\n\nErin Moriarty: They look like really happy children.\n\nMary Howell: Yeah. They were very happy children, very happy. Their mother saw to it that they were.\n\nAfter the murders, Howell took over raising her grandson, Josh. He was 28 when Moriarty interviewed him.\n\nWhen he later spoke to Moriarty, Josh Ryen, now in his late 20s, had few memories of that awful night. \"I wish I could remember... it just won't come back to me though,\" he said. CBS News\n\nErin Moriarty: Do you think about your family?\n\nJosh Ryen: Yes -- probably every day. There's something that reminds me of my sister, my mom or my dad, or my friend Chris.\n\nErin Moriarty: How did you know something was wrong that night?\n\nJosh Ryen: A scream.\n\nErin Moriarty: Do you remember whose scream?\n\nJosh Ryen: No. I think it was my mom's.\n\nPaul Ingels: He then heard his little buddy, Christopher Hughes, yelling for help. \"Help, Josh. Help, Josh.\"\n\nJosh Ryen: My throat was slashed \u2026 and I got stabbed here [points behind his left ear] and hit by an ax here [move his hand above his forehead]. \u2026 I think it's a screwdriver that they said punctured my back into my lung, broke three ribs.\n\nErin Moriarty: You're a miracle, you know that?\n\nJosh Ryen: Yeah.\n\nWhile Josh and his grandmother mourned the senseless deaths, the search for the killers was on -- multiple killers.\n\nPaul Ingels: The original word that we got, that they thought it was three white, possibly Hispanic people. That was the first word that we got.\n\nDeputy Sheriff Dale Sharp, who had rushed to the hospital, was one of the first to question Josh.\n\nErin Moriarty: How did you communicate with Josh if he couldn't talk?\n\nDeputy Sheriff Sharp [holding Moriarty's hand to demonstrate]: I took his hand, like this, and I said, \"Josh, I'm going to ask you some questions. If the answer's yes, then you squeeze my hand. And if it's no, then don't squeeze my hand.\"\n\nIn spite of his severe injuries, Josh tried to answer Sharp's questions about the attack.\n\nDeputy Sheriff Sharp: When we got to the point of asking him how many people were there, I went, \"One, two, three,\" and he squeezed my hand.\n\nErin Moriarty: Three people when things went crazy.\n\nDeputy Sheriff Sharp: Right.\n\nJosh had also indicated the attackers were white or Hispanic. But just days after the murders, police got a break which changed their focus. Down the hill from the Ryen's ranch was a vacant house. Deputies searched it and found evidence that somebody had been hiding out there and had taken off the night of the murders. The intruder turned out to be a convicted burglar named Kevin Cooper, who had escaped from a nearby minimum-security prison.\n\nPaul Ingels: They started putting two and two together and identified him as the suspect.\n\nInvestigators concluded that Josh then was simply confused about seeing three people, and in June 1983 they launched a massive manhunt to capture Cooper.\n\nPaul Ingels: I wanted to be the one to find him \u2026 I wanted to get this guy.\n\nPaul Ingels joined others in law enforcement hunting Cooper down.\n\nPaul Ingels: When you're hunting somebody, if I'd had seen him, I would have told him to freeze. If he would have ran, I would have shot him.\n\nAlmost two months after the murders, Cooper was caught and arrested in Santa Barbara.\n\nErin Moriarty: When Kevin Cooper was arrested, did you have any question that he was, in fact, the person who killed the Ryen family?\n\nPaul Ingels: Everybody believed that he was the one who had done it.\n\nAfter all, who's going to believe that a prison escapee hiding out in a house just 125 yards from the victims' home and who took off the very night the family was slaughtered -- was innocent?\n\nTHE EVIDENCE\n\n\n\nIn San Bernardino County, police and prosecutors were convinced they had the killer behind bars.\n\nD.A. Dennis Kottmeier [2000 interview]: This is a very cold-blooded individual. If he had to kill to escape, he would.\n\nWithin days, investigators focused on a suspect: Kevin Cooper -- a serial burglar who had escaped from a nearby prison two days before the murders. California Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation\n\nAnd according to then-District Attorney Dennis Kottmeier, that's the reason Kevin Cooper murdered the Ryens and Christopher Hughes: the prison escapee desperately needed money and transportation out of the area.\n\nDays after the murders, the Ryens' car was discovered almost 50 miles away in a Long Beach parking lot.\n\n1983 NEWS REPORT: Police eagerly searched the car for clues.\n\nAt a later search, they found two cigarette butts.\n\nPaul Ingels: It's tobacco that's typically issued to inmates.\n\nErin Moriarty: That's pretty damning.\n\nPaul Ingels: That points to Kevin Cooper again.\n\nBut there were also troubling clues inside the vehicle. There was blood found in the car -- oddly, on three of the seats. And none of Cooper's fingerprints were found -- not in the car and nowhere inside the Ryen home.\n\nSheriff Floyd Tidwell [to reporters]: We have evidence in our possession that places Kevin Cooper at the crime scene.\n\nWhat Sheriff Tidwell says investigators did find inside the Ryen home were shoe prints that matched the kind of shoes worn by prison inmates.\n\nSheriff Floyd Tidwell [to reporters]: We have some bloodstains in the house.\n\nIn the hallway, away from the gory crime scene, was one single, tiny drop of blood that a state expert said matched Cooper's blood type. Down the road from the Ryen home they located one of the murder weapons -- a hatchet -- that investigators believe came from the house where Cooper was hiding out and where a sheath was also recovered.\n\nD.A. Dennis Kottmeier: The evidence is strong.\n\nAnd both the D.A. and sheriff say, Kevin Cooper seemed to fit the bill.\n\nFloyd Tidwell: We started looking at his background, found out that he was wanted in Pennsylvania.\n\nThey discovered that Cooper grew up in Pittsburgh and spent years in and out of juvenile detention centers and jails.\n\nPaul Ingels: Kevin Cooper is a burglar by trade.\n\nBack then, Paul Ingels was a police detective.\n\nPaul Ingels: He breaks into houses, he steals things, he takes things\n\nAnd he was good at breaking out of prison when he got caught. There was also an accusation of rape, but Cooper strongly denies it and was never charged.\n\nHe moved to California, and shortly afterward, the determined thief was arrested again. But less than 24 hours after being moved to the minimum-security section of the men's prison in Chino, he escaped -- hiding out in that vacant house near the Ryen home.\n\nPaul Ingels: The circumstantial evidence is stronger than any I can ever recall. \u2026Everybody believed that he was the one who'd done it.\n\nAnd when Cooper was finally arrested, he was paraded before the cameras -- adding to the racially charged atmosphere surrounding this case.\n\n\"This was hanging from the light pole \u2026 This is the kind of thing that was happening at the time and \u2026 This is the first day of the preliminary hearing,\" Paul Ingels explained of a stuffed gorilla hanging in effigy outside the courthouse. KCBS\n\nCooper's trial had to be moved more than 100 miles to San Diego.\n\nD.A. Dennis Kottmeier [to reporters before the trial]: We're seeking the death penalty as we have all along.\n\nDennis Kottmeier prosecuted Cooper.\n\nJosh Ryen, now 10, didn't testify. Instead, Kottmeier showed jurors video of Josh, with his grandmother by his side, answering questions a year-and-a-half after the murders:\n\nD.A. KOTTMEIER: Did you ever see anybody in the house that didn't belong there? JOSH RYEN: You can't really tell at night, 'cause, you know, it could be anyone. It could be my mom or something. D.A. KOTTMEIER: What did you see? JOSH RYEN: I don't know, but, like, I saw almost like a shadow or something.\n\nSole survivor of Chino Hills massacre describes what happened\n\nJosh no longer remembered seeing three white or Hispanic attackers \u2026 only a shadow:\n\nD.A. KOTTMEIER: How many shadows did you see? JOSH RYEN: Just one. D.A. KOTTMEIER: Just the one?\n\nKottmeier, convinced Cooper was the killer, believed Josh was mistaken when he was first questioned. That instead, the three men he described had actually come to the ranch earlier that same day, looking for work.\n\nErin Moriarty [to Kottmeier in 2000]: Why didn't you ask him directly, \"Did you see who killed your family?\"\n\nDennis Kottmeier: Because I didn't want him to ever feel that the conviction rested on his shoulders. Because we had such a strong case, we didn't need to put that burden on him, and I refused to do it.\n\nCooper always denied killing the Ryen family and Christopher Hughes \u2026 or ever being inside the Ryen home. He even took the stand in his own defense.\n\nDennis Kottmeier: The big question is was there sufficient evidence to illustrate the guilt of Kevin Cooper? And the answer to that is yes.\n\nAfter deliberating for almost two weeks, the jury convicted him of first-degree murder. Cooper was sentenced to death.\n\nErin Moriarty: And do you believe that the right defendant was convicted in this case, Kevin Cooper?\n\nDennis Kottmeier: Absolutely.\n\nErin Moriarty: Do you have any doubts at all?\n\nDennis Kottmeier: None.\n\nBut from the beginning, Mary Howell has always had doubts.\n\nMary Howell: I still can't believe that one person could -- could do all that to my family. There's five of them, and I just know that they didn't stand in line saying, \"I'm next.\"\n\nPaul Ingels: She's not convinced that Kevin Cooper did it. \u2026 Typically, victims or victim's family, they don't have doubts.\n\nAnd typically, cops who hunt down murder suspects don't have doubts, either. But in 2000, Paul Ingels, now a private investigator, was working pro bono on Cooper's case.\n\nPaul Ingels: I'm trying to find out what the truth of the matter is.\n\nAnd that's how this odd couple, who should be on opposite sides, found themselves working for the same goal.\n\nMary Howell: He's like me. Whatever it takes, let's find the truth.\n\nPaul Ingels: We're close friends. I love her dearly. \u2026We're not asking to let the guy go, we're just trying to get the truth. If the government doesn't want to get to the truth, then we all have a problem.\n\nONE KILLER -- THREE DIFFERENT WEAPONS?\n\nBy 2000, 17 years had passed since the Chino Hills massacre. Kevin Cooper was awaiting execution in California's San Quentin prison. But private investigator Paul Ingels and Mary Howell still had questions about what happened that horrific night.\n\nMary Howell: Why was my family murdered, you know? Why? And who did it?\n\nIt didn't make sense that Cooper \u2013 a prison escapee who needed money and a vehicle to get out of the area \u2013 would kill anyone.\n\nPaul Ingels: He's a burglar by trade. When he goes into a house, regardless of what happens, he's gonna burglarize the house.\n\nThe Ryens' station wagon had been parked in the driveway with the keys inside, and cash was left on the counter.\n\nPaul Ingels: If, indeed, Kevin Cooper did this murder, why didn't he do the burglary? \u2026 He left the money there, it doesn't make sense.\n\nWhen police recovered the Ryen's station wagon nearly 50 miles away, they found blood on three of the seats. KCBS\n\nWhy would Cooper take the car only to ditch it some 50 miles out of his way when he was headed south to Mexico?\n\nPaul Ingels: Everybody agrees. Prosecution, defense, everybody. He's in Mexico the day after the murders.\n\nAnd if Cooper did the murders alone, why was that blood found on three different seats in the car?\n\nMary Howell: It's just hard for me to believe that one person did all that.\n\nPaul Ingels: One of the reasons Dr. Mary really believes that there was more than one assailant \u2026 she will describe her daughter, Peggy, as a fighter. She was strong, she was a fighter.\n\nPeggy's husband Doug was no pushover, either.\n\nMary Howell: About six foot \u2026 about 180, maybe \u2026 He was strong. He was an MP in the Marines.\n\nWhat's more, Doug and Peggy owned guns and kept them close by.\n\nPaul Ingels: Now here's some of the guns that were found \u2026 There was a gun right over here in this bureau that they did not get to.\n\nBut more troubling to Ingels: the lethal wounds appear to have been caused by at least three weapons.\n\nThe hatchet that was found at the crime scene San Bernardino Sheriff's Department\n\nPaul Ingels: Trial exhibit 42 - this is the hatchet that was found at the crime scene.\n\nThe hatchet was discovered along a road near the Ryen's house. Never found were a knife and an ice pick or screwdriver that were said to have been used. So how did this one man butcher so many people using three different weapons?\n\nPaul Ingels: He's got two hands \u2026 I guess he -- you're saying he was wearing like a utility belt of murder weapons when he entered the residence.\n\nProsecutor Dennis Kottmeier's explanation?\n\nDennis Kottmeier: He's ambidextrous. He could use either hand equally well.\n\nPaul Ingels: That's, really, a great philosophy except for one little fact. There was three weapons. I don't care how ambidextrous you are, you can't hold three.\n\nWhich means Cooper would have to be very skillful and canny. His fingerprints weren't found and the only physical evidence that tied him to the crime scene was that tiny single drop of blood \u2013 so small it's not even visible in an evidence photo \u2013 found down the hall from where the attacks took place. It can be seen on a paint chip.\n\nPaul Ingels: It's called A-41.\n\nPaul Ingels: One drop all by itself just sitting there. It was an unusual place to find it. \u2026 and that's why it's problematic. If you get cut, you don't drop one drop of blood. Everybody knows that.\n\nInvestigators also didn't find any of Cooper's hair in the house, so Ingels wondered whose hair was clutched in 10-year-old Jessica's right hand?\n\nPaul Ingels: She has several strands of long, blonde hair.\n\nAs for those shoe prints found in the Ryen home \u2013 it turns out the prison-issued sneakers were also sold retail. But the biggest problem, Ingels says, may be the crime scene investigation itself.\n\nPaul Ingels: It was bungled from the very beginning.\n\nEvidence was contaminated when the sheriff's department allowed more than 70 people to walk through the Ryen house.\n\nPaul Ingels: That's unheard of. \u2026 that's Police 101.\n\nMaking matters worse, within 48 hours of the massacre, D.A. Dennis Kottmeier ordered the crime scene dismantled. The evidence was stored in a warehouse that wasn't air-conditioned.\n\nNorman Hile, one of Kevin Cooper's defense attorneys, blames that decision for creating problems that have stymied this case for so many years.\n\nNorman Hile: The result was \u2026 the evidence was basically lost. \u2026There could 've been analysis of blood spatter, of the bodies \u2026 how many people were the attackers \u2026 what weapons were wielded by which of them. \u2026That was prevented by them dismantling the crime scene.\n\nSo, questions linger -- particularly about the number of attackers. While the only survivor initially told investigators there were three assailants, by trial, his memory had changed:\n\n[Video deposition] D.A. KOTTMEIER: How many shadows did you see? JOSH RYEN: Just one. D.A. KOTTMEIER: Just the one?\n\nStill, Josh Ryen could not identify that shadow. And back in 1983, while Josh was still in the hospital, Cooper's picture was broadcast on the news.\n\nMary Howell [1985]: When we were in the hospital, when Cooper's picture came on, I said, \"Josh, do you recognize that man?\" And he said, \"No.\"\n\nAnd when Moriarty interviewed Josh years later, she asked him about what he had seen.\n\nJosh Ryen: A head -- like a shadow of -- a big afro, which my mom also had big hair.\n\nErin Moriarty: You don't remember the face that went with it.\n\nJosh Ryen [shaking his head no]: Uh-uh.\n\nCould it have been Cooper?\n\nJosh Ryen: I cannot say he was there.\n\nYet, on June 4, 1983, the day of the murders, Kevin Cooper didn't wear an afro. His hair had been tightly braided.\n\nJosh Ryen: I wish I could remember. \u2026it just won't come back to me though. \u2026I just wish I had more answers.\n\nAnd so did Paul Ingels. Fifteen years after Kevin Cooper was sent to death row, the private investigator was convinced Cooper's case deserved another look.\n\nPaul Ingels: There's a lot of evidence that says that perhaps he didn't do it.\n\nLike a tan \"Fruit of the Loom\" T-shirt found down the road from the Ryen's home.\n\n\"This here is a photograph of the T-shirt. These little circles indicate where blood was found on there,\" Paul Ingels explained. San Bernardino Sheriff's Department\n\nIngels believes that T-shirt was worn by the killer. It was spattered with blood \u2013 some spots consistent with Doug Ryen's blood type. Nothing connected it to Cooper.\n\nErin Moriarty: if it wasn't Kevin Cooper then what you're sayin' is that person could still be out there, or those persons.\n\nMary Howell: It could be, could be.\n\nErin Moriarty: And is that a concern of yours?\n\nMary Howell: Yes.\n\nBut Mary Howell is prepared\n\nErin Moriarty: Do you still have a gun?\n\nMary Howell: My shotgun, yeah. It would make a big hole in a person.\n\nANOTHER POSSIBLE SUSPECT?\n\n\n\nShortly after the Ryens and Christopher Hughes were killed in Chino Hills, another possible suspect emerged: an ex-con named Lee Furrow. He was dismissed by authorities, but he had caught the interest of private investigator Paul Ingels.\n\nErin Moriarty: There's one person you're looking at.\n\nPaul Ingels: Right. \u2026 He's in Pennsylvania. \u2026 This picture was taken late 1982 or early 1983. \u2026 about the time this crime occurred.\n\nDREXEL HILL, PA | 2000\n\nIn 2000, Ingels was keeping an eye on him for Mary Howell and her grandson Josh -- the only surviving witness.\n\nErin Moriarty: Why do you keep an eye on him?\n\nPaul Ingels: So that I know that he can't get to Josh. I want to make sure that he's not back in California.\n\nFurrow came to Ingels' attention through police reports and Diana Roper, Furrow's ex- girlfriend.\n\nErin Moriarty: Are you taking a risk by doing this?\n\nDiana Roper: Oh, yeah.\n\nPaul Ingels: Diana Roper is quite a character. Tough broad. \u2026supreme white power, she's a racist. \u2026She's certainly not doing this because she wants to help Kevin Cooper. I mean, there's just no question about that. \u2026she doesn't think that an innocent man should die.\n\nDiana Roper: The people I was runnin' with told me just to keep my mouth shut.\n\nErin Moriarty: Why? Why did they?\n\nDiana Roper: I don't know -- because they said it was better a black man hanged than a white man. \u2026 I don't care what color he is. \u2026 He didn't do it.\n\nDiana Roper believed that it was Lee Furrow who killed the Ryens, as she told Moriarty in 2000.\n\nDiana Roper: There's no doubt in my mind.\n\nThat's because she knows he's killed before.\n\n\n\nDiana Roper: Just an evil, evil person. \u2026 If you look at him, you look in his eyes, you can see it.\n\n\"There's no doubt in my mind.\" Diana Roper believed that it was Lee Furrow who killed the Ryens and Christopher Hughes, as she told Erin Moriarty in 2000. Diana Roper\n\nFurrow strangled 17-year-old Mary Sue Kitts in a targeted execution back in 1974 -- retaliation for talking about a burglary.\n\nDiana Roper: He told me that he threw her into the Kern River. He bragged about it.\n\nHer body has never been found, but Furrow admitted to the murder and copped a plea by testifying against Clarence Ray Allen, who ordered the hit. It was while Furrow was in prison that he met Diana Roper, who was visiting another inmate.\n\nErin Moriarty: And this is the guy you started to date?\n\nDiana Roper: Yeah, yeah.\n\nAt the time of the Chino Hills murders, Furrow was on parole and living with Diana Roper. It was a life of sex and drugs.\n\nDiana Roper: His rage \u2013 he had no control over it. He was just -- he had no control.\n\nIt was what happened in the early morning hours of June 5, 1983 -- the morning after the Ryens were killed -- that would forever link her to Kevin Cooper's case.\n\nDiana Roper: And it was like early, early morning \u2026 a car pulled up.\n\nRoper recalled Furrow coming into the house.\n\nDiana Roper: I mean, when they came in through the door you could feel something just eerie, real horrible.\n\nAt the time of the Chino Hills murders, Furrow was on parole and living with Diana Roper. Diana Roper\n\nShe remembers he was wearing dark coveralls.\n\nDiana Roper: He went into the room, into the closet \u2026 and he dropped the coveralls.\n\nTwo days later, she was in her closet.\n\nDiana Roper: And I looked down and here was these coveralls \u2026 and I picked them up, and as I picked them up, the more I picked them up, then I saw the blood.\n\nAnd there's more.\n\nDiana Roper: That's not what he left in. I laid his clothes out for him.\n\nRemember that T-shirt found near the crime scene that Ingels believes was worn by the killer? Roper says Lee Furrow was wearing one like it the day of the murders.\n\nDiana Roper: It was like a beige, light brown colored beige.\n\nAnd that hatchet police said came from the house where Cooper was hiding out? Roper said Furrow also had one.\n\nDiana Roper: He kept all his tools on the back porch, hanging on nails. And as soon as they said, I walked back there and the hatchet was the only thing missing.\n\nShe called the sheriff's office about her suspicions.\n\nDiana Roper: I remember two cars came out. \u2026 I tried to tell them that this has to do with the Chino murder. \u2026 they thought I was on drugs or crazy. God is my witness, I was clean. I was not on drugs. I know what I saw.\n\nShe gave deputies the bloody coveralls she found.\n\nDiana Roper: And they took them -- they laid them over on the car, on the police car.\n\nThe deputies took the coveralls and wrote up a report, but it never went any further and the evidence was never sent to a lab for testing. Instead, six months later, one of the deputies tossed out the coveralls.\n\n\n\nErin Moriarty: What was your reaction when you found out that the coveralls had been destroyed?\n\nDiana Roper: Oh, man. \u2026I cannot believe they destroyed such an important piece of evidence.\n\nBack in 2000, we asked Floyd Tidwell, the San Bernardino sheriff at the time of the murders, how this could have happened.\n\nErin Moriarty: Wouldn't you say that taking in coveralls that appear to be covered with blood, not sending them to a lab, not having them tested, and throwing them away before trial would be highly unusual?\n\nFloyd Tidwell: Mm-hmm [affirms]. I don't know that that happened.\n\nErin Moriarty: That did happen.\n\nA \"disposition report\" shows the coveralls were \"destroyed\" and described as having \"no value\" -- discarded with the approval of the deputy's supervisor. CBS News\n\n\n\nIn fact, a \"disposition report\" shows the coveralls were \"destroyed\" and described as having \"no value\" -- discarded with the approval of the deputy's supervisor.\n\nErin Moriarty: But doesn't that concern you that maybe not all the evidence was available at Kevin Cooper's trial?\n\nFloyd Tidwell: Not on -- I can't be concerned unless I know about it.\n\nErin Moriarty: But it was something that happened when you were sheriff. It was your sheriff's department.\n\nFloyd Tidwell: Hey, let's bring this to a screaming halt right here, OK. That's enough of that crap [walks off camera and rips off his microphone].\n\nAnd there is other evidence that points to more than one killer. Mary Wolfe and Christine Slonaker reported that on the night of the murder, they were at the Canyon Corral Bar, just down the road from the Ryen's house, when three guys came in.\n\nChristine Slonaker: These fellas came in the back door, and they were kind of fallin' all over each other.\n\nErin Moriarty: They were Caucasian?\n\nChristine Slonaker: Uh-huh [affirms].\n\nThey came over to where the women were sitting; one was wearing coveralls.\n\nChristine Slonaker: I realized at that time that he was just covered in blood, spattered in blood.\n\nMary Wolfe: It was spotted \u2026 he had a light-colored shirt on so it was -- you know, it showed up. Even though the bar was real dark, you could still see it.\n\nHe blamed it on a bloody nose, but, Slonaker, trained to draw blood samples, didn't buy his story.\n\nChristine Slonaker: And being a licensed phlebotomist, you don't lose that much blood in a nose bleed.\n\nErin Moriarty: When you first heard that the Ryens' been murdered, what was your first thought?\n\nChristine Slonaker: The guys in the bar.\n\nThe jurors at Kevin Cooper's trial were told about Diana Roper and the missing coveralls. But they never got to hear about the three men at the bar because Slonaker and Wolfe didn't come forward until long after Kevin Cooper was sentenced to death. And when they did, others at the bar had conflicting accounts.\n\nMary Wolfe: I don't know if he's guilty or innocent, but I just feel really uncomfortable and uneasy about it.\n\nChristine Slonaker: It just leaves reasonable doubt, that's all.\n\nPaul Ingels: Needless to say if we had those coveralls, they could have tested them. What if some of the blood on the coveralls would have been closely matched to that of one of the victims? \u2026 Unfortunately, because the sheriff's department destroyed those coveralls, we can never do that.\n\nErin Moriarty: Why would the sheriff's department try to protect a guy like Lee Furrow? He's a bad guy. He's a killer.\n\nPaul Ingels: They're not trying to protect Lee Furrow. Let's make sure we understand what's going on here. They've got their man, and they don't want anything to screw that up. They're not about to let somebody come in and muddy the water and screw up a conviction. That's not gonna happen.\n\nSo \"48 Hours\" decided to ask Lee Furrow about the Ryen murders ourselves.\n\nErin Moriarty: Do you think Lee Furrow is going to want to talk to me?\n\nPaul Ingels: I think the chances are slim and none, and slim's out of town.\n\nLEE FURROW'S STORY\n\nBack in 2000, \"48 Hours\" hired Paul Ingels to lead us to Lee Furrow.\n\nPaul Ingels: Lee Furrow is a sociopath.\n\nErin Moriarty: You say that without any hesitation.\n\nPaul Ingels: Oh, absolutely.\n\nSurprisingly, Furrow agreed to an interview.\n\nLee Furrow: Here I am and I'm willing to talk to anybody.\n\nCBS News\n\nSo, we asked him about Diana Roper turning in those bloody coveralls.\n\nLee Furrow: I know nothing of the coveralls. \u2026 I wear Levis and T-shirts and stuff like that. I don't wear coveralls.\n\nErin Moriarty: Why should I believe you and not Diana?\n\nLee Furrow: 'Cause I'm a good person. Yeah.\n\nErin Moriarty: You're a good person?\n\nLee Furrow [looks down]: Yes, I am. Yes. I've made mistakes in the past and I've paid for my mistakes.\n\nErin Moriarty: You consider killing just a mistake?\n\nLee Furrow: Yeah, it was a mistake.\n\nLee Furrow strangled 17-year-old Mary Sue Kitts in a targeted execution in 1974 -- retaliation for talking about a burglary.\n\nErin Moriarty: You killed a young woman at someone else's behest?\n\nLee Furrow: Yes. Yes, I did.\n\nErin Moriarty: According to testimony in the court, you strangled her.\n\nLee Furrow: Well.\n\nErin Moriarty: Is that correct?\n\nLee Furrow: Yes.\n\nErin Moriarty: And then how was she disposed of?\n\nLee Furrow: Dumped in the river.\n\nBut that was all he was admitting.\n\nErin Moriarty: Can I ask you point-blank, did you kill the Ryen family?\n\nLee Furrow: No, I did not.\n\nErin Moriarty: Or Christopher Hughes?\n\nLee Furrow: No, I did not. \u2026 I had nothing to do with any of this.\n\nFurrow says he was at a concert. It's the same thing he told authorities when they interviewed him a year after the Chino Hills murders.\n\nLee Furrow: Evidently, they found no validity in the story and released me.\n\nPaul Ingels: The police did a very milquetoast interview of Lee Furrow. It's a horrible interview.\n\nIngels says the interview lasted just 22 minutes.\n\nPaul Ingels: Why didn't they ask the tough questions? \u2026 They really didn't probe it because they had their guy in Kevin Cooper.\n\nBut Furrow insists he told San Bernardino deputies the truth.\n\nLee Furrow: I went down voluntarily, took a lie detector test, the whole thing.\n\nErin Moriarty: You took a lie detector test?\n\nLee Furrow: Yes, I did take the lie detector test.\n\nThat's not true says Paul Ingels.\n\nDet. Paul Ingels: He lied. Why did he lie?\n\nGood question. But according to Dennis Kottmeier, it's irrelevant.\n\nDennis Kottmeier | Former district attorney: The big question is was there sufficient evidence to illustrate the guilt of Kevin Cooper? And the answer to that is yes.\n\nErin Moriarty: Was there any evidence found at the scene that could be tied to Lee Furrow?\n\nPaul Ingels: I don't know. It was never checked. \u2026I'll guarantee you this, if they didn't have anyone in custody \u2026 they would have probed that a lot more, and I also bet you that coveralls would not have been thrown away.\n\nWhich takes us back to Diana Roper. Furrow thinks she contacted the sheriff's department out of spite.\n\nLee Furrow: it was just a girlfriend being mad 'cause I was dating another girl in town. And it was just completely absurd.\n\nErin Moriarty: How do I know you're not just setting up Lee Furrow?\n\nDiana Roper: Because I \u2013\n\nErin Moriarty: I mean, he ran off with your best friend.\n\nDiana Roper: We both were sleeping with her, so what did it matter. You know, I mean it was no big deal. I gave him to her.\n\nPaul Ingels: Do I know for sure he's involved? Of course not. Do I know for sure Kevin Cooper is innocent? Of course not, but there's all these questions lingering. If you want the answer, it's real easy. Do the DNA testing and we'll get closure for everybody.\n\nDNA testing wasn't available when the murders occurred in 1983, but in 2000, California passed a law allowing inmates to ask for post-conviction testing. Kevin Cooper hoped to be the first death row inmate to use it.\n\nMary Howell: Everybody knows that I want to know the truth.\n\nMary Howell, Paul Ingels and Diana Roper wanted the same thing, and they hoped the state would test some of the most significant pieces of evidence -- especially the tan T-shirt.\n\nDiana Roper: I think it should be done.\n\nErin Moriarty: You could have just let this go.\n\nDiana Roper: I can't. How could I let it go \u2026 that young boy. I can't even imagine what he lives with every day. \u2026 it's just not right.\n\nIt turned out Josh Ryen also supported DNA testing.\n\nJosh Ryen: I want to know if he really did it.\n\nWith no clear memory of the massacre, Josh told \"48 Hours\" he had grown up wondering if the wrong man had been punished for the crime.\n\nJosh Ryen: I couldn't live with myself knowing that, well, there could have been a chance that he didn't do it. That's not right.\n\nIn 2001, the state agreed to test some of the evidence for DNA: that bloodstained paint chip known as A-41, saliva on those cigarette butts, the hairs found in Jessica's right hand, and some of the blood stains on that T-shirt.\n\nBy then, Kevin Cooper had been on death row for 16 years. Everyone was anxiously waiting for the results.\n\nMary Howell: We need the DNA testing to prove something and we'll go from there.\n\nJosh Ryen: I think it's great. It clears a name or it points the finger at him.\n\nThe testing was completed in July 2002 and Kevin Cooper says he couldn't believe it. The paint chip and the two cigarette butts all tested positive for his DNA. The tan T-shirt that had never been connected to Cooper suddenly was.\n\nNorman Hile | Cooper's attorney: He was-- shocked. He was-- absolutely-- certain that foul play had occurred.\n\nCooper immediately claimed the tested evidence had to have been tampered with or planted by authorities. As for the hairs in Jessica's hand, there wasn't enough DNA to test. But Cooper's fate was sealed: he was on track to be executed.\n\nErin Moriarty: Does that make you feel confident that Kevin Cooper was definitely involved in this?\n\nJosh Ryen: Yeah \u2026 It's pointing at him.\n\nWhile Josh Ryen expressed relief, his grandmother Mary Howell, remembering what Josh had originally told investigators, still had her doubts.\n\nMary Howell: I just cannot see one man doing all that that he did and handle three instruments. \u2026 I'm still not convinced that this is the whole truth.\n\nAnd she may be right. Kevin Cooper may not have been the killer at all.\n\nWas Kevin Cooper Framed?\n\nCOOPER'S EXECUTION STAYED\n\nKevin Cooper, after 19 years on death row, was scheduled to die by lethal injection on Feb. 10, 2004.\n\nErin Moriarty: Would you go watch him die?\n\nJosh Ryen: Yes.\n\nErin Moriarty: You would need to do that?\n\nJosh Ryen: Yes. He was there. So, he needs to pay for that.\n\nErin Moriarty: If Kevin Cooper is executed, you believe they'll be killing an innocent man?\n\nMary Howell: Yes, I do.\n\nSAN QUENTIN | 2004\n\nOn Feb. 10, 2004, Kevin Cooper's date with death was set. And then, with just hours to go, the 9th Circuit federal appellate court stepped in and saved Cooper's life. He later described that moment to \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty by phone.\n\nErin Moriarty: How close did you come?\n\nKevin Cooper: I came within three hours and 42 minutes of being strapped down to that gurney and physically tortured with lethal poison.\n\nAfter the court stayed his execution, attorney Norman Hile, working pro bono, joined Cooper's defense.\n\nNorman Hile: I think Kevin is innocent. And I also think that he was the victim of a horribly racist prosecution. And I just don't give up.\n\nFor the next four years, Hile fought to get Cooper a new trial, petitioning court after court. But the boxes of legal documents continued to pile up. Mary Howell still refused to say it was over.\n\nSadly, the 93-year-old grandmother never got the answers she hoped for. In 2008, Mary Howell died. Kevin Cooper had been on death row for 23 years. CBS News\n\nMary Howell: Everybody knows that I wanna know the truth \u2026 why my family was killed. Who did it? Why? \u2026 and I don't want to die without knowing it.\n\nSadly, the 93-year-old grandmother never got the answers she hoped for. In 2008, Mary Howell died. Kevin Cooper had been on death row for 23 years.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO | 2009\n\nIn 2009, Cooper finally got a break. By now his case was back in front of the 9th Circuit Court with 27 judges. While the majority refused to review his case, 11 of them disagreed.\n\nNorman Hile: There is not a single case in U.S. history where 11 appellate judges said that they felt that the person had not gotten a fair hearing.\n\nOne judge, William Fletcher, wrote in a scathing 100-page dissent, \"the state of California may be about to execute an innocent man \u2026\" and \"there is substantial evidence that three white men, rather than cooper were the killers.\"\n\nIn a lecture, he pointed to contradictions in the only survivor's account. Josh Ryen first indicated the assailants were three white or Mexican men. By trial, his story was different.\n\n[Video deposition] D.A. KOTTMEIER: How many shadows did you see? JOSH RYEN: Just one. D.A. KOTTMEIER: Just the one?\n\nJudge Fletcher believes Josh's memory was influenced by a deputy who had visited josh \"approximately twenty times\" during his hospital stay:\n\nJUDGE WILLIAM FLETCHER [NYU LECTURE]: The deputy got Josh to change his story so that he no longer said that three to four white men did it.\n\nThe judge also noted josh never identified Kevin Cooper:\n\nJUDGE WILLIAM FLETCHER [NYU LECTURE]: During his stay in the hospital Josh twice saw a picture of Cooper on television, both times he said Cooper was not one of the killers.\n\nIt is what Cooper's lawyers have been saying all along.\n\nNorman Hile: As soon as they identified Kevin Cooper, a black escaped prisoner, in the house down the hill from the Ryens, they stopped looking for those people, and focused entirely on \u2026 proving that Kevin Cooper had killed the Ryens.\n\nJudge Fletcher also questions the key piece of evidence in this case: that drop of blood. The state says it proves Kevin Cooper was inside the Ryen home. The criminalist said it was one blood type and later he said it was another.\n\nNorman Hile: When he found out that he'd put the wrong blood type down, and he had not matched it to Kevin, he changed his notes to say it was the same blood type as Kevin's.\n\nThe judge says the criminalist \"altered his lab notes and claimed that he had misinterpreted his results.\" But that's not all. Remember the cigarette butts found in the Ryen's station wagon? Defense attorney Norman Hile believes they came from the home where Cooper had been hiding out.\n\nNorman Hile: When they found the Ryen's station wagon they planted those two cigarette butts.\n\nWhat's more, Hile says that one of those cigarettes inexplicably grew from one state test to another.\n\nNorman Hile: The previous tested cigarette butt \u2026 was four millimeters long \u2026 and the one \u2026 in 2002 was seven \u2026 millimeters long\n\nJudge Fletcher says deputies \"discounted, disregarded and discarded evidence pointing to other killers \u2026\" like evidence provided by Diana Roper. She called the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office after she found bloody coveralls left in her closet:\n\nJUDGE WILLIAM FLETCHER [NYU LECTURE]: The bloody overalls were, to say the least, inconvenient, so the deputies threw them away. \u2026 Kevin Cooper, the man now sitting on death row, may well be -- and in my view, probably is -- innocent.\n\nErin Moriarty: Doesn't that give you pause? Doesn't that make you feel that you have to do whatever you can to make sure that the right person's being executed?\n\nMichael Ramos: The right person is being executed.\n\nDistrict attorney Michael Ramos inherited Cooper's case in 2002.\n\nMichael Ramos: It doesn't give me pause at all, because we're talking about a dissenting judge - of the 9th Circuit Judge's Court of Appeals and which is, uh, federal, you know, with all due respect, a very liberal Circuit. \u2026 the majority opinion was not only guilty \u2026 overwhelmingly guilty.\n\nWAS COOPER FRAMED?\n\nBy 2010, Kevin Cooper, 52 years old, had been on death row nearly half his life. His appeals had run out, but the state of California had halted executions; he was in legal limbo. And then a newspaper columnist 3,000 miles away took notice.\n\nBy 2010, Kevin Cooper, 52 years old, had been on death row nearly half his life. California Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation\n\nNicholas Kristof writes op-ed columns for the New York Times.\n\nWhat caught Kristof's attention was Judge William Fletcher's dissent.\n\nNicholas Kristof: I had never read an opinion like this with a respected circuit court judge arguing that somebody on death row had been framed.\n\nKristof is a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer covering genocide and human rights issues, and there was something about Kevin Cooper's case that struck a chord.\n\nNicholas Kristof: Prosecutors kinda seized upon him as -- that you know, he's sent by central casting. He looks the part that people had in their minds for a ruthless killer.\n\nNicholas Kristof: And it is particularly \u2013 problematic when a black person is charged with the killings of a white person. Or, in this case, white people \u2026 and I think that made it a lot harder for Kevin Cooper to be tried fairly for this crime.\n\nKristof is haunted by another death penalty case. Cameron Todd Willingham was put to death by lethal injection in 2004. Two years later, evidence surfaced showing he was likely an innocent man.\n\nNicholas Kristof: I wish that I had written about the case back then. I think I screwed up \u2026 I don't think my writing would've particularly made a difference in that case. But you have to try. And so, I'm trying in Kevin Cooper's case.\n\nKristof wrote about Cooper's case in 2010, but for the next seven years the case seemed frozen. So Kristof wrote another column in 2017.\n\nNicholas Kristof: It just disappeared without a ripple. In fact, it was one of my worst read columns in 2017.\n\nThen in May 2018, he tried again. Kristoff and a team from The New York Times did an in-depth investigation into Cooper's case. They took a fresh look at the evidence that has long been questioned: A-41, that tiny bloodstained paint chip and the tan T-shirt that the state says tested positive for Cooper's DNA in 2002. Kristof's conclusion?\n\nErin Moriarty: You believe, as you're sitting here right now, that there was evidence planted?\n\nNicholas Kristof: I believe that there was evidence planted.\n\nBut if that's true, how did Cooper's DNA get on the paint chip and on that tan T-shirt? Defense attorney Norman Hile has a theory: authorities had Cooper's blood.\n\nNorman Hile: When Kevin Cooper was arrested \u2026 they took two vials of blood from him. And that's the blood they could have used.\n\nWas evidence planted against Cooper? \"I think he put either my saliva or blood in there. Or something in there. He had it out for 24 hours \u2026 And you only sign it and date it when you open the container,\" he told \"48 Hours\"' Erin Moriarty in January 2019. San Bernardino Sheriff's Department\n\nAnd before the DNA tests were performed, the glassine envelope which contained A-41 was checked out overnight -- signed out to the same criminalist who first matched the blood to Cooper. His reason? He said it was to assure there was enough evidence to test.\n\nEarlier this month, Moriarty spoke with Cooper by phone:\n\nErin Moriarty: Kevin, what do you believe happened when he took what we've been calling A-41, the single drop of blood that they say connects you to the case?\n\nKevin Cooper: I think he put either my saliva or blood in there. Or something in there. He had it out for 24 hours \u2026 And you only sign it and date it when you open the container.\n\nErin Moriarty: And the date is on there. You know, I've seen the picture.\n\nKevin Cooper: Yes \u2026 and so that means he opened it \u2026 but why did he take it out the vault?\n\nAs for the T-shirt, a judge who held a hearing on evidence tampering in 2003 determined that \"The shirt \u2026 had not been checked out or looked at by anyone prior \u2026DNA testing \u2026\"\n\nBut that's not accurate. The state showed \"48 Hours\" the T-shirt a year before the DNA tests were done -- when we first started looking at the case.\n\nThe state showed \"48 Hours\" the T-shirt a year before the DNA tests were done -- when we first started looking at the case. CBS News\n\nErin Moriarty [with T-shirt in 2000]: If you were gonna test this shirt here, you would test it for what?\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" McGuigan | Cooper defense team member: To see if there's any DNA there that can be tested.\n\nKristof believes there's a suspicious pattern in Cooper's case.\n\nNicholas Kristof: I think this is unusual in the enormous amount of evidence that suggests that Kevin Cooper was framed, the way consistently a place would be searched, no evidence would be found and then once they knew they were looking at Kevin Cooper, then they would search again. And [snaps his fingers] abracadabra, they would find critical evidence that they needed against him.\n\nFormer District Attorney Michael Ramos says claims of evidence tampering have been dismissed by both state and federal courts.\n\nMichael Ramos: As far as planting evidence, that's absolutely impossible. \u2026There was no evidence tampering at all.\n\nThe New York Times also produced a podcast to accompany Kristof's column.\n\nThe Daily Podcast: Voice of Kevin Cooper: I'm ashamed of things I have done, but I am not a murderer and that's real.\n\nKristof called for new DNA testing in cooper's case and got a huge response from readers, politicians, and even celebrities. Kim Kardashian West sent out this tweet:\n\nGovernor Brown, can you please test the DNA of Kevin Cooper? https://t.co/MB4kE03sC4 \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) June 16, 2018\n\nErin Moriarty: What was your reaction when she actually went on social media saying you deserve to get testing?\n\nKevin Cooper: I was very thankful \u2026 that she cared enough and took the time out of her busy life to do that.\n\nErin Moriarty: I understand even the Pope responded?\n\nNicholas Kristof: The Pope weighed in. Yeah, how -- how great is that?\n\nErin Moriarty: You saw the article written by Nicholas Kristof.\n\nMichael Ramos: Right.\n\nErin Moriarty: Is he wrong?\n\nMichael Ramos: Absolutely wrong \u2026 And I wish that he would've taken the time to go over the evidence. The evidence that was presented at the trial. The evidence that was presented to the appellate courts \u2026 the federal proceedings \u2026 I truly believe that he didn't do his homework before writing that one-sided, very one-sided story.\n\nNicholas Kristof: So, if you disagree with [laughs] my conclusions, then test the evidence \u2026 the best response, if you don't like my argument, is to prove me wrong with the evidence that is sitting in lockers and has been for 35 years.\n\nWHO WORE THE TAN T-SHIRT?\n\n\n\nIn 2018, more than three decades after Kevin Cooper was sent to death row, with so many people asking questions, \"48 Hours\" went back to the man who has always searched for the truth, private investigator Paul Ingels.\n\nEven after all these years, he's hung onto his files.\n\nErin Moriarty: As you sit here today, do you think it's possible that some of that evidence was planted?\n\nPaul Ingels: Absolutely. \u2026 planted or contaminated, or maybe both.\n\nAnd Ingels has always been troubled by evidence that points to multiple killers, not one.\n\nErin Moriarty [driving with Ingels]: Where are we heading right now?\n\nPaul Ingels: We're gonna head up to the vicinity of where the murders took place, Chino Hills.\n\nBack to the Chino Hills neighborhood where the Ryens once ran their Arabian Horse ranch high up on the hill and he showed \"48 Hours\" where some of the evidence that Cooper wants tested was found.\n\nErin Moriarty: Where was the hatchet found?\n\nPaul Ingels: In this vicinity here, it's changed. It used to be this was all weeds and stuff.\n\nThe hatchet was believed to have been dropped by the killer or killers after the murders.\n\nNext, we drove to where the Canyon Corral Bar once stood. That's significant because on the night of the murders, witnesses said they saw three white men in the bar -- one of them wearing a light-colored T-shirt and another wearing bloody coveralls.\n\nChristine Slonaker | Possible witness: I realized at that time that he was just covered in blood, spattered in blood.\n\nMary Wolfe | Possible witness: He had a light-colored shirt on, so it was, you know it showed, even though the bar was still dark you could still see it.\n\nErin Moriarty: When you first heard that the Ryens had been murdered, what was your first thought?\n\nChristine Slonaker: \"The guys in the bar.\"\n\nFurther down the road from the Ryen home, authorities found a blood-stained tan T-shirt [seen circled in green]. Some of the blood stains matched Doug Ryen's blood type. None were found to match Kevin Cooper. Investigators also found an orange towel they believed came from the Ryen home. San Bernardino Sheriff's Department\n\nAnd not far from that bar is where investigators found an orange towel they believed came from the Ryen home and the tan blood-spattered T-shirt.\n\nErin Moriarty: So, doesn't that lend some credence that \u2026 those three guys could have walked into the bar?\n\nPaul Ingels: Absolutely. \u2026the evidence is right there.\n\nPaul Ingels: The one piece of evidence that I don't think could be tampered with is the sweat on the inside of neck and under the armpits. I mean how would a corrupt deputy plant sweat on a T-shirt? Can't do it.\n\nThat's exactly what Diana Roper told \"48 Hours\" in 2000.\n\nDiana Roper: DNA, the sweat off the T-shirt, that's all I got to say.\n\nRoper, who died in 2003, insisted that her ex-boyfriend Lee Furrow had been wearing a tan T-shirt the night of the murders. State investigators had discounted her story and questioned her credibility.\n\nDiana Roper: \u2026 they thought I was on drugs or crazy. God is my witness, I was clean. I was not on drugs. I know what I saw.\n\n\"48 Hours\" wanted to hear from Lee Furrow, so Moriarty asked Paul Ingels to help track him down. By then, Furrow had moved across the country to Pennsylvania and he agreed to talk.\n\nMoriarty asked Furrow about the bloody coveralls that Roper said were his.\n\nLee Furrow: I never had any coveralls.\n\nAs for the tan T-shirt, Furrow had told investigators he was wearing a tank top the night of the murders.\n\nErin Moriarty: Can I ask you point-blank, did you kill the Ryen family?\n\nLee Furrow: No, I did not.\n\nErin Moriarty: Or Christopher Hughes?\n\nLee Furrow: No, I did not.\n\nLee Furrow: I had nothing to do with any of this.\n\nBut Furrow doesn't deny he's killed before. The body of 17-year-old witness Mary Sue Kitts was never found.\n\nErin Moriarty: How did you kill her?\n\nLee Furrow [shakes his head no]: That's -- you know, between me and the courts.\n\nErin Moriarty: According to testimony in the court, you strangled her. \u2026 Is that correct?\n\nLee Furrow: Yes.\n\nErin Moriarty: Then how was she disposed of?\n\nLee Furrow: Dumped in the river.\n\nErin Moriarty: Is that the only time you killed anyone?\n\nLee Furrow: Yes.\n\nThe coveralls are long gone, but will forensic testing of the tan T-shirt tell a different story? Today, those tests are sophisticated enough to identify DNA from sweat. Can the person who wore this T-shirt 35 years ago be identified? We took our questions to Dr. Dan Krane, a biology professor and DNA expert at Wright State University in Ohio and we provided him with lab reports in Cooper's case.\n\nErin Moriarty: I mean is it really likely that you would be able to find out the wearer of this T-shirt 35 years after a crime?\n\nDr. Dan Krane: Well, first, the time isn't particularly important \u2026 DNA is a very stable molecule. It would persist for many decades, maybe even centuries \u2026 those areas you're talking about sampling, the collar, the arm pits, that's routinely done \u2026 Those tests are very straightforward, they can be very reliable.\n\nErin Moriarty: So, there's a good chance that you will get a DNA profile?\n\nDr. Dan Krane: I am very comfortable saying I would be surprised if a DNA profile was not generated from those samples.\n\nAs for that hatchet discovered near the crime scene, testing may be more difficult.\n\nDr. Dan Krane: It's been dusted for fingerprints, so the dusting process could have moved DNA from one part to another. Just looking at the photograph it appears as if there's a lot of victim's biological material here \u2026 I expect you'll see a DNA profile that corresponds to the victims and you may not even be able to get a hint that there was somebody else's DNA there.\n\nThe defense also wants that hatchet sheath and orange towel tested, but there are challenges with testing this old evidence.\n\nDr. Dan Krane: Now the problem \u2026 may be a mixture of many people's DNA.\n\nErin Moriarty: And why is that a problem?\n\nDr. Dan Krane: Well, mixtures are very difficult to interpret.\n\nAnd this is part of the reason the state is opposing new testing.\n\nErin Moriarty: Dr. Krane, what about the state's argument that this shirt has been handled by so many people, including jurors, at the original trial. That there's simply too much of a risk of contamination to trust the results?\n\nDr. Dan Krane: Well I think it's a reasonable point. \u2026 but \u2026 if you found not only that it wasn't Kevin Cooper's DNA on the shirt but a specific other alternative suspect's DNA \u2026 then I think the burden shifts over to the prosecution to explain how that \u2026 DNA might have been transferred to the shirt while it was in their care.\n\nTo show us how easy it is transfer DNA, Krane did a simple demonstration using a packet of sugar.\n\nDr. Dan Krane: So, if we just rip it open and I can put some of that sugar in my hand \u2026 we'll spread it around a bit. [Krane then shakes the sugar from his hand onto a table]. There's still sugar on my hand.\n\nDr. Dan Krane: Let's shake hands. \u2026 If you look carefully, you'll see there's sugar on your hand. There's some on mine \u2026 Not only is there plenty of sugar grains there, there's also plenty of my DNA there now, too. \u2026 it's really easy to transfer DNA from one thing to another, from one person to another.\n\nKevin Cooper's defense suspects Lee Furrow was part of the crew that killed the Ryen family and Christopher Hughes, but to prove it, they need to get a sample of his DNA.\n\nA MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH\n\nMore than 35 years since the brutal murders in Chino Hills, California, there is still no peace for Josh Ryen and the family of Christopher Hughes. They believe Kevin Cooper is responsible. In a letter to California Governor Jerry Brown last April, Josh wrote:\n\n\"Kevin Cooper is in my mind every day. He is a nightmare which plays over and over in my head. I can never get away from him.\"\n\nBut Cooper -- facing death -- still insists he's innocent.\n\nKevin Cooper [on the phone with Moriarty]: I cannot take responsibility for murders I did not commit.\n\nAnd he's asked Governor Brown to take the extraordinary step to order new DNA tests.\n\nNorman Hile | Cooper's attorney: I don't see that as a bad gamble, from our perspective. What have we got to lose?\n\nBut the state is fighting it. Former D.A. Michael Ramos believes the victim's families have suffered enough.\n\nMichael Ramos: The tests have been done. Any further tests \u2026 is not going to \u2026 take away the evidence that we have that Kevin Cooper committed these murders. \u2026 You talk about cruel and unusual punishment, that's what you're doing to the family if you allow this murderer, manipulator, to work the system to get these further 'tests' that aren't going to disprove anything.\n\nStill, Cooper's attorneys are so confident that new tests will clear Cooper, they're offering to pay for them. They believe that DNA from sweat on the T-shirt will match Lee Furrow, that paroled killer. Defense investigator Tom Parker, a retired FBI agent, says he's now found new witnesses -- one who says Furrow admitted he was involved in the murders.\n\nTom Parker: These people had no reason to make any of this up. They gained nothing from it \u2026 They are willing to testify. But we're not gonna divulge who they are right now.\n\nErin Moriarty: What is Lee Furrow's connection with the Ryens? What would be his motive?\n\nNorman Hile: Well, that's something that we have actually developed a lot more information and possibilities.\n\nDefense attorney Norman Hile believes the connection between the Ryens and Furrow may have been Clarence Ray Allen, who ordered Furrow to kill once before. Allen owned show horses.\n\nNorman Hile: So, everybody's been wondering, well, what was the motive here? And we have four different connections between the Ryen murder and a horse deal gone bad that related to the Ryens. And we think that is the reason why the murders took place.\n\nBut Furrow has always said he had an alibi; he was at a concert that night.\n\nMichael Ramos: He was 30-plus miles away from the crime scene when the murders occurred.\n\n\"48 Hours\" tried to talk to Furrow again earlier this month, but he wouldn't talk to Moriarty.\n\nTo try to prove Furrow is involved, the defense team wants a sample of his DNA. Furrow was willing to give one.\n\nErin Moriarty: Were you surprised he was just willing to hand over his DNA?\n\nTom Parker: I was astonished that he was willing to do that. And I asked him why and he said he had nothing to hide.\n\nTo try to prove Lee Furrow is involved, the defense team wanted a sample of his DNA. Furrow was willing to give his saliva, but not his blood.\n\nFurrow is seen with a relative at a meeting that was secretly recorded by Investigator Parker:\n\nTOM PARKER [TO FURROW]: Would you mind opening your mouth? I'll do this side here.\n\nLee Furrow was willing to give his saliva, but not his blood.\n\nLEE FURROW: I'm not doing blood work and end up on evidence like whatever they did to Kevin Cooper.\n\nFurrow still disputes he ever owned or wore a tan T-shirt like the one his ex-girlfriend Diana Roper said he was wearing the night of the murders:\n\nTOM PARKER: You never had a tan t-shirt like that? LEE FURROW No. Never. TOM PARKER: That's not what you had on? LEE FURROW: No. TOM PARKER: OK, well DNA's gonna tell us \u2026 even 35 years later, those skin cells are still gonna be there. LEE FURROW: Good\n\nNorman Hile: We have the DNA of the person we think killed the Ryens. That's Lee Furrow.\n\nIt was up to California's Governor Jerry Brown to decide whether any of the evidence in Cooper's case would be retested. And in December, just 14 days before Brown left office, Cooper got a surprise.\n\nCalifornia governor orders new DNA test in notorious murder case\n\nThe news made headlines everywhere, including social media:\n\nWonderful Christmas news: Gov Brown has ordered DNA testing in the case of Kevin Cooper, whom I believe was framed for a quadruple murder. After several decades, we may finally learn definitively what happened. Congrats to Cooper, his legal team, and all who fought for testing. \u2014 Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) December 24, 2018\n\nJust saw the press release from Governor Brown regarding Kevin Cooper! Such amazing news! pic.twitter.com/GUVIgcQYDq \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) December 25, 2018\n\nErin Moriarty: How did you hear about it?\n\nKevin Cooper: I found out about it on Christmas morning when I was watching the news.\n\nThe governor's order is limited in scope. DNA tests will be allowed for only four items: the hatchet, the sheath, the Tan t-shirt and the orange towel. A retired judge was appointed to make sure the tests are done properly.\n\nOn Dec. 24, 2018, California Gov. Jerry Brown approved new DNA testing on four pieces of evidence: the sheath, the hatchet, the tan T-shirt and an orange towel found near the Ryen home that matched ones from inside. San Bernardino Sheriff's Department\n\nKevin Cooper: I'm just trying to stay positive and hopeful, but I'm also skeptical.\n\nErin Moriarty: Are these DNA tests really a matter of life or death?\n\nNorman Hile: They are for Mr. Cooper, for sure.\n\nErin Moriarty: Does he know what he's up against?\n\nNorman Hile: He continues to believe \u2026 he has hope \u2026 that someday he will ultimately be exonerated.\n\nNicholas Kristof: Let's use the technologies we have to figure out who wore the tan T-shirt. \u2026 maybe they won't provide answers, but it's also possible they will solve the case. And how can we leave that stone unturned?\n\nAttorneys for both sides are working out the details for Kevin Cooper's new DNA tests.\n\nThe testing is expected to take place in the next few months.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: On Feb. 22,2019, California Gov. Gavn Newsom ordered DNA testing on evidence that Kevin Cooper says would prove his innocence: testing of hair, blood, fingernail scrapings from the victims and a green button."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/sole-survivor-of-chino-hills-massacre-describes-what-happened/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/podcast-spotlights-starkville-mississippi-double-murder-can-new-dna-technology-solve-the-case/", "text": "Produced by Lourdes Aguiar\n\nBetty Jones and her friend Kathryn Crigler were brutally attacked on Labor Day in 1990 after answering a knock on the door at Crigler's Starkville, Miss., home. Jones, who opened the door, was stabbed immediately and died. Crigler, who was in a wheelchair, was in the rear of the home. The killer walked back to Crigler's room, raped her, strangled her and left her for dead. Crigler was able to crawl to a phone and call for help. She died two months later.\n\nStarkville detective Bill Lott says the crime scene \"was as bad as anything Jack the Ripper ever did.\"\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" Lott told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Richard Schlesinger this past summer of not yet having solved the crime. \"Yeah, it's frustrating, no doubt about it.\"\n\nThe case, which was unsolved for three decades, prompted Betty Jones' step-grandson, Jason B. Jones, to spotlight the case in a podcast. Jones, who was 10 at the time of the murders, launched his podcast in September 2017 as a way to work through his own questions about the incident and, perhaps, have someone uncover new information.\n\nBut what began for \"48 Hours\" as a story about a cold case turned into something much different, thanks to Lott's determination and cutting-edge DNA technology that didn't exist when the women were killed.\n\n\"Even though I'm a dinosaur, I'm constantly getting on the Internet and looking at science,\" said Lott.\n\nThat trail led him to Parabon NanoLabs in Reston, Virginia, which developed technology that can predict what someone looks like through DNA.\n\n\"It's like, 'now I know what you look like,'\" Lott said. \"'Now I'm going to get you.'\"\n\n\"I've just felt an electricity about that this is going to be solved sooner than later,\" says Juky Crigler Holt, the granddaughter of Kathryn Crigler.\n\nWill technology help solve the case and get long-sought-after answers for the Jones and Crigler families?\n\nA KNOCK AT THE DOOR\n\nJason Jones has a job he loves. He designs album covers and produces music videos in Nashville, Tennessee. But for more than a year, he had a second passion. He had a podcast \u2014 a dark podcast \u2014 and it was personal.\n\n\"KNOCK KNOCK\" PODCAST: I will never forget that night \u2026 I remember waking up in the middle of the night sweating.\n\nJason launched his podcast in September 2017. It had an odd title, \"Knock Knock,\" and is about a particularly vicious crime that had been unsolved for nearly 30 years.\n\n\"KNOCK KNOCK\" PODCAST: I can't imagine the terror that Betty and Kathryn felt when they realized behind that knock, knock ... stood a monster.\n\nFor Jason, this was more than just a murder tale \u2014 it's the story of his family. Betty Jones was his step-grandmother.\n\nBetty Jones with her step-grandson, Jason B. Jones. Jason B. Jones\n\nJason Jones: I think that there was this [signals with his hand like a flatline] this hum of fear throughout our family after Betty died.\n\nIt was Labor Day 1990. Jason was 10 years old and living outside of Houston. That's when his family got that phone call telling them Betty had been murdered in Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Were you scared?\n\nJason Jones: Oh, yeah ... I knew enough to know that there was someone out there that killed my grandmother and they may wanna kill me, too.\n\nJason's parents Bill and Colleen Jones struggled to explain it all to him and his younger brother Simon.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Do you remember the words you used?\n\nColleen Jones: \"We don't know why, but God called Betty home and you'll see her again someday.\"\n\nBetty came into their family late in life. She was a widow when she married Jason's grandfather. He already had two grown children including Bill, Jason's father.\n\nBill Jones: She was wonderful \u2026she took us in as her own children you know and was just warm and loving and just an angel to me.\n\nSadly, Betty's marriage to Jason's grandfather did not last long.\n\nJason Jones: My grandfather passed away from a heart attack just a few years into their marriage.\n\nAlthough Jason only knew his step-grandmother for a few years when he was young, she left her mark.\n\nJason Jones: She was the lady that came over and took us to nice restaurants and smelled really good. That's how I remembered her as a 10-year-old. She was the grandmother that was really into baseball which ... for a little boy, havin' a grandmother that's into baseball is pretty cool.\n\nBetty Jones was the baseball team mom for the Mississippi State University Bulldogs Starkville Police Department\n\nBetty Jones was more than just a baseball fan. She was a team mom for the Mississippi State University Bulldogs in Starkville. Her job was to keep the players from getting homesick and wanting to leave.\n\nBetty's sister, Anne McWhorter, says Betty often brought the players chewing gum to keep them from other vices.\n\nAnne McWhorter [imitating Betty]: \"Now, honey [laughs]. I want you to be sure and chew that gum. Now, don't you get into that tobacco!\"\n\nRichard Schlesinger: She had a real connection with this baseball team.\n\nAnne McWhorter: She did, but she had a connection with any age person.\n\nKathryn Crigler was one of the people to whom Betty felt connected. Betty was 65; Kathryn was 81, a retired school teacher. She was taking some new medication and Betty volunteered to keep her company in case she fell ill.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What was the basis of their friendship?\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Church.\n\nJulia Crigler Holt, known as Juky, says her grandmother and Betty were active members of the First Presbyterian Church, which was right next door. Betty was a church elder. Kathryn sang in the choir and she played the piano at home.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: I think that was her dream for me to be a pianist. That didn't happen, but I took lessons for her.\n\nTo this day, Juky has warm memories of her grandmother's house. Kathryn had raised two children there and it was a gathering spot for extended family.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Her house was a quaint little house. I never, in a million years, would ever feel scared in that location.\n\nThat night in 1990 started out peacefully enough. The two friends were just settling in after suppertime. That changed around 9 p.m.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: They had taken baths, they had their gowns on, they were getting ready to watch a ballgame when somebody knocked on the door.\n\nDavid Lindley | Retired Starkville Police Chief: The monster came to the door.\n\n\n\nDavid Lindley is now retired. but he was the lead investigator at the time. He says when Betty opened the back door, an intruder forced his way in.\n\nDavid Lindley: As best we can tell entered into a physical confrontation with her. And she tried to defend herself.\n\nKathryn Crigler was left bleeding. She had fractured ribs and a broken hip. But she somehow managed not just to survive \u2014 but to call for help. Julia Holt\n\nKathryn Crigler was all but helpless. She was an amputee and she was in her wheelchair in the bathroom when she heard Betty calling for help.\n\nDavid Lindley: She tried to see what was goin' on and the attacker appeared. He ended up makin' her go into her bedroom ... and told her that he did not want to hurt her like he had hurt her friend ... he in fact did rape Miss Crigler ... And he left the residence sometime shortly thereafter, we surmised.\n\nKathryn was left bleeding. She had fractured ribs and a broken hip. But she somehow managed not just to survive \u2014 but to call for help.\n\nDavid Lindley: Miss Crigler was able to \u2014 rally her strength ... she couldn't get to her wheelchair. So, she took a pillow and \u2014 used it to \u2014 kind of glide or slide into the kitchen area, where there was another phone and she was able to reach up.\n\n911 OPERATOR: Are you Miss Crigler? KATHRYN CRIGLER TO 911: Yes. Tonight there was one single boy \u2014 a young man \u2014 and he went in the front room where my friend was and he came back with his hands all bloody. And then he raped me. I know, it's just terrible.\n\nKathryn was rescued by EMS, but, in the living room with the baseball game still playing on the TV, Betty was dead on the floor. Her throat was slashed. She died trying to save Kathryn.\n\nAnne McWhorter: She was a fighter. And I know that when this guy started attackin' her, Betty fought back like a wild cat.\n\nBetty's death left a hole in her family's life and everyone in the small university town was on edge. As it turns out, police wouldn't have to look far for a good suspect \u2026 there was one right next door to Kathryn's house.\n\nTHE HUNT FOR A SUSPECT\n\nEven now, it's hard for Juky Crigler Holt to think about the details of what happened to her grandmother, Kathryn.\n\nBut Juky is still amazed by the courage and the strength her grandmother summoned after she was attacked, to get help for herself and her friend, Betty.\n\n\"I think to look at these pictures \u2014 it makes me sad. How horrible it is to know that at the very last part of her life something so horrible would happen,\" said Juky Crigler Holt, pictured with her grandmother, Kathryn. CBS News/Julia Holt\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: It makes me proud of her. Because she could've totally just given up right then. Most people would ... That's pretty amazing.\n\nSadly, Kathryn was unaware at first that Betty was killed.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Clearly what I can remember her saying all the time was, you know, if anything ever happened ... to Betty, I don't want to live.\n\nBetty's stepson, Bill Jones, visited Kathryn in the hospital after she learned her friend was dead. It was an emotional visit.\n\nBill Jones: She was upset that she survived and Betty had gone.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Do you remember what she said?\n\nBill Jones [emotional]: She said, \"I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, please forgive me.\" And I said, \"I forgive you.\"\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Did you feel that she was responsible?\n\nBill Jones [Shaking his head] No ... it tore me up. But that's all I could say or do, and that's what she wanted, so that seemed to help.\n\nIn November 1990, two months after the attack, Kathryn Crigler died of complications from her injuries.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: There's no doubt that whoever killed Betty that night, killed your grandmother ... It just took longer.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nBut Kathryn had lived long enough to give the Starkville police a description of the assailant.\n\nDavid Lindley: She said he was a young man \u2026 Short hair that was almost cut like a crew cut \u2014 spiked, I guess you would say these days. He had blue eyes and light blonde hair or brown hair.\n\nPolice released a rudimentary sketch.\n\nDavid Lindley: She described his complexion as swarthy ... And we imagined that to be something either as \u2014 a skin tone or a suntan.\n\nInvestigator David Lindley says the killer left a few clues behind.\n\nDavid Lindley: We collected fingerprint evidence, we collected hair evidence, blood \u2014\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You found some cigarettes there.\n\nDavid Lindley: We did \u2026 And neither of the women smoked. And \u2014 so we of course assumed that the perpetrator left the cigarettes at the scene.\n\nBut the police could not figure out a motive. The killer took $28 from Kathryn, but nothing else. And Lindley didn't think a petty thief would commit a crime this violent.\n\nDavid Lindley: But in this particular case there was just no rhyme or reason for it ... This is a crime of violence, purely for the sake of violence.\n\nThe hunt for a suspect was intense and police had a lot to work with. Lindley provided an update soon after the killing back in 1990:\n\nDAVID LINDLEY TO REPORTERS: Residents of Starkville are extremely helpful in providing leads and right now we have several leads that we are pursuing.\n\nMany of those leads, like a report of a drifter spotted in the area, went nowhere. But a good suspect soon emerged. A young neighbor of Kathryn Crigler's was having a party at his house the night of the attack. He had blonde hair and blue eyes \u2014 just like the killer Kathryn described.\n\nA rudimentary sketch of the suspect was later updated to show hair and eye color Sgt. Bill Lott/Starkville Police Dept.\n\nThe more police investigated, the more their suspicion grew.\n\nDavid Lindley: He did leave the party for a period of time. ...But nobody at the party could recall for exactly how long he was \u2014 gone from the party.\n\nWhat's more, the young man was known to carry a knife and he smoked the brand of cigarettes found at the scene.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Well, that must have caught your attention.\n\nDavid Lindley: Certainly.\n\nThe suspect also reportedly made a cryptic and possibly incriminating statement to a witness when asked about the crime.\n\nDavid Lindley: He stated that he did not do it, but his other self may have done it.\n\nPolice had a lot of suspicion but did not think they had hard evidence to arrest him.\n\nDavid Lindley: There was never enough probable cause to make an arrest \u2026 I think a lot of people in the community naturally believed that this individual committed this crime \u2026 They wanted it resolved quickly, but unfortunately it didn't occur that way.\n\nPolice were back at square one and, after three years of dead ends, investigators turned to \"America's Most Wanted,\" which agreed to feature the case. Everyone had high hopes.\n\nAnne McWhorter: Well, I was hoping that somewhere up in Chicago or California someone would \u2026 brag in a bar \u2026 you know, \"I was in Mississippi at that time. And [whispers] \u2014 hey, I did it. I did it.\"\n\nDavid Lindley helped man the phones at the show's headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\nDavid Lindley: We received many, many tips from all over the United States.\n\nIt looked promising, but only for a while.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Anything pan out?\n\nDavid Lindley: They did not \u2026 It was unsuccessful. A good attempt, but again, unsuccessful.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: The level of hope that you must have felt.\n\nDavid Lindley: This case has been a heartbreaker over the years ... So, disappointing is a good word.\n\nIn 2004, Lindley \u2014 who by then had been promoted to chief of police \u2014 handed the case over to an enthusiastic detective named Bill Lott. And Lott was intrigued by this case.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: When I first got assigned this case, I didn't do anything for the first year but read it six times ... I bet Chief Lindley thought, \"when is this kid gonna start workin' this case?\"\n\nBut as Lott dug in he became confident that the case could be solved.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: And I knew at that point I had a critical piece of evidence.\n\nA CHANCE MEETING\n\nSergeant Bill Lott's roots run deep in Starkville, Mississippi. And he has struggled for years to solve the mystery that has hung over his town since Labor Day of 1990.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: And to think that somebody would do something as heinous as this to elderly people just \u2014 it made me angry.\n\nLott feels a personal connection to Betty Jones and Kathryn Crigler.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Because \u2014 my parents had divorced at an early age and aunts and uncles helped raise me. And they were older. I had an older aunt that, you know, played a role in my life ... it just didn't sit well with me.\n\n\"48 Hours\" correspondent Richard Schlesinger and Sgt. Bill Lott CBS News\n\nWhen Lott took over the investigation in 2004, he inherited boxes of evidence, hundreds of pages of police reports, and a decade-and-a-half of frustration.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Let me tell ya somethin' \u2014 there was a lot of great, great detective work done ... The only advantage I had over those guys was DNA.\n\nThat's because when the crime was committed in 1990, not much was known about forensic DNA. But with new knowledge and new technology, Lott knew he had potentially critical evidence, because doctors had extracted DNA from Kathryn Crigler using a sexual assault kit.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: They might not have known it at the time but that was a key moment in this case.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: There's no question about it \u2026 that was the key to the gate.\n\nPolice kept the evidence and in 2005 Lott sent it to a lab.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What did that lab do for you with this evidence?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: They got a semen-based DNA profile.\n\nWith the DNA profile of the killer in hand, Lott's first order of business involved an old suspect: that blond-haired, blue-eyed man who was partying next door to Kathryn's house.\n\nRichard Schlesinger [with Lott looking at a container of evidence]: What is this?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: This is \u2014 contains the original kit of the number-one suspect that supposedly did this crime.\n\nLott had the killer's DNA profile compared to the DNA of the young man who many in Starkville still believe had been responsible.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What did it show?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Not a match.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Not a match?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Right.\n\nThe one-time prime suspect was almost certainly not the man who killed Betty Jones and Kathryn Crigler. In 1990 there was a lot of pressure to arrest that man. And Lott believes if he had been arrested he would have been convicted and executed.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Has this case ... changed the way you feel about the death penalty?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: I'll say it this way. I used to 100 percent pro-death penalty.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Now?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: [Sighs] Now I think it would have to be on a case-by-case basis.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Sounds like a shift to me.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Yes, because he could've been put to death for a crime he didn't commit.\n\nLott went on to test the DNA of 60 other potential suspects; none was a match. There was also no match in CODIS, the national DNA database of violent criminals.\n\nAnne McWhorter | Betty Jones' sister: I had resolved that it would probably never be solved ... that I would go to my grave without knowing \u2014 who did this.\n\nHours away in Tennessee, Jason Jones and his family \u2014 who had grown distant from Betty's over time \u2014 knew little about the investigation.\n\nJason Jones: No one was calling us. We were the extended family.\n\nAnd Jason says over the years his family hardly ever spoke about Betty' s death.\n\nJason Jones: It becomes this taboo subject where people don't really disclose information because it's hard to talk about.\n\nBut now, as an adult, Jason was more curious than ever.\n\nJason Jones: I wanted to know what had happened, and so I Googled it, and nothing came up ... it was shocking to me that I couldn't find information about this case or my grandmother's murder or her life or anything.\n\nHe had questions about Betty, but he had even more about Kathryn Crigler.\n\nJason Jones: I don't think I knew the name Crigler, to be honest.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You didn't know the name of the other person.\n\nJason Jones: I don't think so.\n\nBut in August 2005, when Jason was getting married, there was a huge, almost unbelievable development. His fiance's mother held a bridal shower and invited some of her friends. Stories frequently come out of bridal showers, but not like this story:\n\nColleen Jones: I was busy playing mother of the groom. And \u2014 so I was introduced to a lot of people that day.\n\nJason's mother Colleen was chatting with a young art teacher when they discovered that even though they were both in Nashville, they had a Mississippi connection.\n\nColleen Jones: And I told her that I had married a guy that had gone to high school and college in Starkville. And she said, \"Starkville? My grandparents lived there. What's your husband's last name? What were your in-laws' last name?\" And as soon as I said, \"Betty Jones\" \u2026 it was just like she had seen a ghost, and I was it.\n\nStanding before Colleen Jones was Kathryn Crigler's granddaughter, Juky.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Well how did you feel?\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Just wow! You know? What are the chances?\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Well, you tell me [laughs]. What are the chances?\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Yeah, one in a gabillion. You know? It's amazing.\n\nBoth women were quick to see a larger meaning to the chance meeting.\n\nColleen Jones: This cannot be coincidental, happenstance ... It's like the angels went [she sings] \"ahhhh.\"\n\nBut it wasn't until 2017 that Jason, who was inspired by true-crime podcasts, decided he should spotlight the cold case.\n\nA podcast journey: Man seeks answers to Mississippi murder mystery\n\n\"KNOCK KNOCK\" PODCAST: Even as a child I learned what the monsters fear. Whether imaginary or real \u2014 monsters today still fear the light.\n\nJason Jones: The podcast was not only a way for me to learn more about the life of a grandmother that was taken from me too early ... but also a way to try to seek justice or to make sense of what happened.\n\nWorking on the podcast would force Jason to return to the place he last saw when he was 10 years old \u2014 Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nJason Jones [in Starkville]: It's always been a story. And on this trip, it just \u2014 progressively became more real.\n\nBut it's always been real to Sergeant Lott who has never given up and believes one of Starkville's oldest cases with be solved with the newest technology.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: And I wanna get this guy. And this is a good tool. This is as good a tool as we've had in a while.\n\nCUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY\n\nIn early 2017, Jason Jones traveled to Starkville, Mississippi \u2014 a place he had long associated only with death and sadness.\n\nJason Jones: This just feels like Pleasantville, USA.\n\nBut visiting the home where his step-grandmother spent the last moments of her life brought back those familiar dark feelings.\n\nJason Jones [inside the house]: I just feel overwhelmed here. It's not even sadness it's \u2014 there's just a magnitude. I don't know. It's hard to describe.\n\nJason Jones: I hadn't visually put together that this was a real place with real walls and real windows.\n\nJason Jones [inside the house]: Now that I am here I could, I could really understand what it would be like this ... that's ... that sense of being trapped and \u2014 and that overwhelming panic.\n\nBeing in this place and knowing what happened here made it even more important to Jason to find out who was responsible, and to share the search with his listeners.\n\n\"KNOCK KNOCK\" PODCAST: How is it that we could have untampered DNA evidence, yet no matches had been made? If we couldn't find a match, honestly, could this case ever be solved? CBS News\n\nBut Sergeant Bill Lott was still working this case, often on his own time.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: I told my wife, I said, \"If I retire and I still haven't solved this case, you're gonna be rollin' me up to the police station in a wheelchair where I'm working on it ... I'm not quittin.\"\n\nAnd DNA technology is improving quickly. In June, Lott had the suspect's DNA profile sent to Parabon NanoLabs in Reston, Virginia. Parabon works with cutting-edge technology performing what is called DNA phenotyping.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: DNA phenotyping means predicting a person's appearance from DNA.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak is Parabon's lead scientist for DNA phenotyping.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: How new is this technology?\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: It's very new. It's been available to law enforcement for less than four years. And at the beginning, there was a lot of skepticism ... DNA was seen as having this one purpose for matching. And we were saying, \"No, there's all this other information you can get from DNA.\n\nThat's because DNA is like a blueprint for a person's ancestry and physical characteristics. There are DNA codes that tell the color of your eyes, your hair, and your skin. The codes also tell your face shape, and even if you have freckles \u2014 and how many.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: And we've trained up our computers to recognize those genetic signatures ... And then if we run a crime scene sample from an unknown person through that model and the computer recognizes one of those signatures, it can say, \"There's a high probability that this came from someone with blue eyes.\" ... And then as you add each trait, you end up with a smaller and smaller group of people.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: If I'm a cop looking for a needle in a haystack, it seems to me you've just taken away a lot of hay.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: Absolutely. It is extraordinarily helpful with eliminating a lot of suspects \u2026 and focusing an investigation.\n\nParabon showed \"48 Hours\" how they came up with the composite in the Starkville case.\n\nHow cutting-edge DNA technology is used to develop composite sketches\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: We've got the predicted face shape and we've got the predicted skin color on there. But we don't have the predicted eye color or predicted hair color.\n\nBut this process is part science, part art.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: This is sort of a blank canvas, to use an artistic analogy.\n\nThom Shaw is a forensic artist who interprets the computer's conclusions and makes the image more lifelike. The computer had concluded that this killer would most likely have some freckles, brown hair, and light blue eyes.\n\nThom Shaw: And so then I can go \u2026 to that collection of light blue eyes and pick out, \"OK, this is \u2014 this is the one we like.\"\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: And we're not producing a photograph. So we don't know the person's age, their weight, anything that they've done with their hair or tattoos, scars, things like that. But we can give a description, which is something that the \u2014 that these detectives didn't have before.\n\nIn late August 2018, Parabon sent Sergeant Lott two composites: the first one, pictured at left, showed an idea of what the suspect looked like in 1990; a second composite was age progressed to show what he might look like now. Parabon NanoLabs, Inc\n\nIn late August 2018, just a few days shy of the 28th anniversary of the Labor Day murders, Parabon sent Sergeant Lott two composites. The first one showed an idea of what the suspect looked like back in 1990. And a second one that showed what he might look like now.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: When you look at this picture, what goes through your mind?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Where are you? [smiles] And how am I gonna find you?\n\nBut other experts at Parabon were using another method to find the suspect: genetic genealogy.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: In genetic genealogy, we're uploading it to GEDmatch, which is a public database of people who have explicitly chosen to publicly share their DNA for other people to search and have explicitly consented to law enforcement usage.\n\nThere are roughly one million people on GEDmatch.com who are searching for family members. The DNA of the Starkville killer was compared to DNA of all those people to see if one of them might be at least a distant relative. And they found something.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: So in this case we were able to find some good matches ... so these are people who genetically match our unknown subject. And we're trying to figure out, based on knowing approximately how much DNA is shared, can we build their family trees and figure out who this unknown person is.\n\nGenetic genealogy helped police catch the alleged Golden State Killer, who is believed to have murdered 13 people and raped 50 women across California in the 1970s and 80s. So Lott hopes it can help him, too.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: I've been over obsessed with it, lookin' at it to see if I've got the genetic genealogy yet.\n\nThe Jones and Crigler families sensed investigators were on the verge of something big.\n\n\"I've just felt an electricity about that this is going to be solved sooner than later,\" says Juky Crigler Holt, the granddaughter of Kathryn Crigler. CBS News\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: I've just felt an electricity about that this is gonna be solved sooner than later.\n\nAnd they were right.\n\nDavid Lindley: I was asleep here at home and about 4am I received a text from Sergeant Lott and he said, \"We got him!\" ... It wasn't very eloquent, but I believe my exact quote was \"you're sh\u2014ing me!\"\n\nTHE SUSPECT\n\n\"KNOCK KNOCK\" PODCAST: Over the course of this season, we've unpacked Betty and Kathryn's lives. \u2026 We've seen \u2026 setbacks and huge opportunities for moving this case forward.\n\nThis past summer as Jason Jones was completing his podcast series, he was hoping \u2014 among other things \u2014 that a listener would come forward with information about the murder. A listener did come forward, but with a completely unexpected story.\n\nJason Jones: We got a message from a girl by the name of Betty Hong. Her story was hard to believe, honestly.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What was it?\n\nJason Jones: Betty e-mailed us and let us know that she was actually named for my grandmother.\n\nBetty Hong told Jason that in the '80s, her family \u2014 having escaped the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia \u2014 were sponsored by Betty Jones and several other members of the First Presbyterian Church to come live in Starkville. Betty's mother Kim Hong says her family came to the U.S. with their freedom, but very little else.\n\nKim Hong: Back then I come, I don't have nothing ... I only have two bag.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You came with just two bags?\n\nKim Hong: Two small bag, yeah.\n\nIt was before Betty Hong was born, but she says Betty Jones took care of her family and helped them get settled in America.\n\nBetty Hong: She truly impacted my parents' lives directly by clothing them, bringing them out to eat, and did it out of love. And [tearful] we got to come to America and have this American dream. So it's really \u2014 Betty Jones is, like, one of those angels that lived upon us ... But now that she's passed, I feel like she's someone who watches over me.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What is the emotion you're feeling now?\n\nBetty Hong: It's this burst of just \u2014 thankfulness.\n\nBetty Hong and Jason Jones meet for the first time. Betty was named for Jason's step-grandmother, Betty Jones. CBS News\n\nThis past summer, \"48 Hours\" brought Jason and Betty Hong together for the first time.\n\nBetty Hong: We're like family.\n\nJason Jones: We're totally family, yeah.\n\nThe Hong's story became part of the seventh and last episode of the podcast that aired in August 2018. But although the podcast had its finale, it had no finality. Because, still, no one knew who killed Betty and Kathryn.\n\nJason Jones: What I would hope is that if we did a season two of \"Knock Knock,\" that it would be about the conviction and the trial of the person who killed Betty and Kathryn.\n\nAnd just weeks after that interview with Jason, it began to look like the story would have the ending he wanted after all. Because, finally, Sgt. Bill Lott had a suspect.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What was it that led you to this guy?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Genetic genealogy.\n\nLott's faith in science paid off. A genetic genealogist at Parabon had completed weeks of detailed work building family trees based on those DNA matches on GEDmatch.com, and she gave Lott a name.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: It seemed surreal. It didn't \u2014 it seemed like I was dreaming ... it wasn't a dream, it was real.\n\nLott's suspect: 51-year-old Michael Wayne DeVaughn, a twice divorced father of three. He'd worked in construction and farming most of his life. And he was being held in a jail a few hours away on drug charges.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Why wasn't his DNA in the national database?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: He had no prior criminal history until recently ... He's never served time or anything like that. No, he has not.\n\nLott believed DeVaughn had features similar to the ones depicted in the Parabon composite, but he needed to make sure he had the right man. So he sent a cigarette butt that DeVaughn discarded while in custody on the drug charges to a lab for DNA testing. The result: the DNA on the cigarette was a match to the DNA taken from Kathryn Crigler the night of the attack.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You went up and got him that day? That Saturday?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Oh yeah \u2026 Oh yeah, it was time.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: It was time.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: It was time.\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2018, 28 years after the crime, Betty and Kathryn's suspected attacker was brought in shackles to Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2018, 28 years after the crime, Michael DeVaughn was charged with Betty Jones' murder and the rape and sexual battery of Kathryn Crigler.

Bill Lott [choking up at a press conference]: It's been a long, long journey, but I would do it all over again.\n\nAnd later that day, Lott visited the man who had worked the case first \u2014 retired Police Chief David Lindley.\n\nDavid Lindley: Congratulations!\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Congratulations to you. You did a lot of great work. I just finished it.\n\nBetty Jones and Kathryn Crigler Anne McWhorter/Julia Holt\n\nInvestigators were finally able to give the victims' families the news they wanted.\n\nAnne McWhorter | Betty Jones' sister: I looked at her picture this morning for the first time in a long time, the tears just flowed down my face ... It was just, \"Bet I miss you \u2014 even 28 years later.\"\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Did you think that you would see this day?\n\nAnne McWhorter: No ... You can't believe it because 28 years is a very long time, but there was a bit of excitement there that it's finally done. He's finally been found.\n\nJason Jones was trying to absorb the news so soon after his podcast's final episode. But his reaction was not as simple as he expected.\n\nJason Jones: I thought I would feel either happy or mad, but the feelings are a lot more complicated than that ... I feel a sadness towards him that he was a guy that made a series of terrible choices that resulted in taking something away from us that was irreplaceable.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt wasn't quite as understanding.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: He looked like a man to me that probably had no empathy whatsoever.

While the Russian leader didn't say what specific new weapons Moscow could deploy, his statement further raised the ante in tense relations with Washington.\n\nSpeaking in his state-of-the-nation address, Putin charged that the U.S. has abandoned a key arms control pact to free up its hands to build new missiles and tried to shift the blame for the move to Russia.\n\n\"Our American partners should have honestly said it instead of making unfounded accusations against Russia to justify their withdrawal from the treaty,\" Putin said.\n\nThe U.S. has accused Russia of breaching the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty by deploying a cruise missile that violates its limits - the accusations Moscow has rejected.\n\nThe INF treaty banned production, testing and deployment of land-based cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,410 miles).\n\nThe intermediate-range weapons were seen as particularly destabilizing as they take shorter time to reach their targets compared to the intercontinental ballistic missiles. That would leave practically no time for decision-makers, raising the likelihood of a global nuclear conflict over a false launch warning.\n\nPutin reaffirmed that Russia will not be the first to deploy new intermediate-range missiles but warned of a quick retaliation if the U.S. puts such weapons in Europe.\n\nMcCabe: Trump believed Putin over U.S. intelligence about North Korean weapon threat\n\n\"They will only take 10-12 minutes to reach Moscow,\" he said. \"It's a very serious threat to us, and we will have to respond.\"\n\nHe didn't directly mention the U.S., but noted that the Russian response will be \"asymmetrical\" and involve new weapons will reach the enemy's decision-making centers just as quickly.\n\n\"Russia will be forced to create and deploy new types of weapons that could be used not only against the territories where a direct threat to us comes from, but also against the territories where decision-making centers directing the use of missile systems threatening us are located,\" he said. \"The capability of such weapons, including the time to reach those centers, will be equivalent to the threats against Russia.\"\n\nThe president didn't specify which of the prospective Russian weapons will do the job, but he reported a quick progress on an array of new weapons presented a year ago.\n\nThe Russian leader said the first batch of Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles will be deployed this year. Putin said the development of a vehicle that the military said is capable of flying 27 times faster than the speed of sound was a technological achievement comparable to the 1957 Soviet launch of the first satellite.\n\nHe added that the tests of the new Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater drone have been progressing successfully.\n\nPutin said the first submarine equipped to carry the Poseidon will be commissioned later this year. Shortly after Putin's speech, the Defense Ministry released a brief video showing a test of the Poseidon, which can target coastal areas with a heavy nuclear weapon, causing a devastating tsunami wave.\n\nPutin also announced the coming deployment of the new Zircon hypersonic missile for the Russian navy, saying it's capable of flying at nine times the speed of sound and will have a range of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\nHe said the Zircon program will not be too costly as the missile has been designed to equip Russia's existing surface ships and submarines.\n\nPutin added that the military will deploy more Kinzhal airborne hypersonic missiles, which entered service last year. The Defense Ministry said Wednesday the Kinzhal has been successfully tested at a range exceeding 1,000 kilometers (more than 620 miles) against both sea and land targets.\n\nPutin urged U.S. officials to take into account the \"range and speed of our prospective weapons\" before making decisions that will threaten Russia.\n\n\"We are only asking about one thing: Do the count first before making decisions that could create new serious threats against our country and would trigger retaliatory measures,\" he said.\n\nWhile issuing a tough warning to the U.S., Putin also claimed that Russia still wants friendly relations with Washington and remains open for arms control talks.\n\n\"We don't want confrontation, particularly with such a global power as the U.S.,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he criticized what he described as \"destructive\" U.S. policy of targeting Russia with sanctions.\n\nRussia's relations with the U.S. have sunk to post-Cold War lows over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, its support for the Syrian government in the war in Syria and the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe menacing talk about new weapons and the tough warnings aimed at the U.S. followed a speech that mostly focused on domestic issues.\n\nPutin promised Russians that he would raise welfare payments, improve education and the struggling health care system and remove toxic dump sites from cities. Similar goals have been set before, but the progress has been slow as Russia has been buffeted by economic shocks caused by a drop in oil prices and Western sanctions."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/us-intelligence-sources-say-american-jailed-in-russia-not-a-spy/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/john-bolton-says-us-troops-not-leaving-syria-yet/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trying-to-save-yemeni-children-who-are-too-hungry-to-eat/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-votes-to-end-u-s-support-for-saudi-war-in-yemen/", "text": "The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a resolution to end American armed forces' support for the Saudi-led coalition in the country. The bipartisan resolution concerning war powers, approved 56-41, represents the first time ever the Senate has voted to revoke military support from a congressionally unauthorized war.\n\nThe Senate also passed an amendment, introduced by GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, to ensure that mid-air refueling between U.S. and Saudi Air Force, which the U.S. suspended last month, does not resume. But there's no chance that lawmakers will stop U.S. support for the Saudis' prosecution of the Yemen war this year because the House will not vote on the measure before the end of the year.\n\nU.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict began in 2015 when the Obama administration offered logistical assistance in Yemen to Saudi Arabia's forces fighting against Houthi rebels, who are aligned with Iran. Senators supporting the legislative maneuver Thursday say the 1973 War Powers resolution forbids logistical assistance like this from the U.S. without congressional approval.\n\nAfter more than four years of fighting, the death toll is now in the tens of thousands, with many of the dead being children suffering from debilitating malnourishment, according to human rights groups. Tens of millions more Yemenis are displaced.\n\n\"In a war waged by adults, it is the country's children who suffer first and suffer most ... thousands of Yemeni children could die from severe malnutrition if conditions, including conflict and economic crisis, do not improve soon,\" Henrietta Fore, executive director of the U.N. children agency, said recently.\n\nBoth the plight of these Yemenis and the Senate resolution gained attention in October after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was connected to Saudi Arabia. Support for the resolution was led by a bipartisan group of senators, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy.\n\n\"What the United States Senate said in a very loud way is that we will not continue to have our military posture dedicated by a despotic, murderous regime in Saudi Arabia,\" Sanders said after the vote.\n\n\"When we are putting American treasure, and even more importantly, American blood on the line, it is wrong to entrust that to one person,\" Lee said, arguing that Congress should have its say in war powers.\n\nSix other Republicans joined Lee and Democratic colleagues in supporting the resolution: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Steve Daines of Montana, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Young.\n\nLast week, a similar resolution was introduced in the House by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. But a provision slipped into the farm bill by House Speaker Paul Ryan stipulated that the House would not vote this year on the Yemen resolution.\n\nSenators said they hope Democratic House leadership considers a new resolution next year. The Senate, too, would have to vote again on the resolution.\n\nEarlier in the day the Senate also passed a nonbinding resolution declaring that it holds Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman \"responsible\" for Khashoggi's death. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker, who is retiring at the end of the year, introduced the measure.\n\nMurphy welcomed the bipartisanship of the vote as a positive sign.\n\n\"What we showed in this vote today is that Republicans and Democrats are ready to get back in the business of working with a president -- and sometimes against a president to set the foreign policy of this nation,\" the Connecticut senator told reporters.\n\nIf passed by the next Congress, President Trump will have to sign and approve the resolution or veto it.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president signaled an openness to moving the U.S. away from the conflict. \"Well, I'm much more open to Yemen because frankly, I hate to see what's going on in Yemen,\" Mr. Trump told Reuters, \"But it takes two to tango. I'd want to see Iran pull out of Yemen too...and I think they will.\"\n\nHowever, administration support for the resolution is not guaranteed. In late November, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with Defense Secretary James Mattis, tried to lobby senators to continue the U.S. support of the Saudi coalition. At the time, Pompeo said Yemen would be \"a hell of a lot worse\" if the United States abandoned a role in the Yemen.\n\nAmerican forces continue to provide logistical support and \"certain information\" to the Saudi and Emirati coalition, Mattis said in October.\n\n\n\nTalks between Yemen's government the Houthi rebels are currently being held in Switzerland. However, Yemen Prime Minister Abdulmalik Maeen Saeed told CBS News on Saturday that help from America in the future is critical.\n\n\"The support of the U.S. is important. The government should be in control of every position in Yemen, the institutions should be rebuilt with security and army,\" Saeed said."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/yemen-civil-war/", "text": "Hasan Minhaj calls for donations for Yemen after Netflix yanks episode in Saudi\n\n\"Clearly, the best way to stop people from watching something is to ban it, make it trend online, and then leave it up on YouTube,\" he tweeted"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/theresa-may-no-confidence-vote-today-2018-12-12/", "text": "Boeing to make standard a warning light that was not on doomed planes"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/brexit-britain-breaks-with-the-eu/", "text": "Could the fate of Brexit could come down to a \"people's vote\"?\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is working on a \"plan b\" Brexit deal after her initial plans were shot down earlier last week.

The school, Central European University, called it \"a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary.\"\n\nCentral European University (CEU), established in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union, is one of the top-ranked universities in the region. According to the mission statement on its website, one of its aims is to be \"a source of support for building open and democratic societies that respect human rights and human dignity.\"\n\nIt says it will be moving its U.S.-accredited programs, which account for more than 80 percent of its degrees, to Vienna, Austria.\n\nMonday's announcement came after a drawn-out battle with the increasingly authoritarian government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which has been cracking down on dissent in the country, as well as on organizations with links to Soros, who was born there but is now a U.S. citizen.\n\n\"This is unprecedented,\" CEU president Michael Ignatieff said in a statement. \"A U.S. institution has been driven out of a country that is a NATO ally. A European institution has been ousted from a member state of the EU.\"\n\nOrban v. Soros\n\nSoros has been demonized by Orban and his Fidesz party for years, and an anti-Soros narrative made up a large part of their election campaign.

CEU is an American-accredited institution, but did not at that time have a campus in the U.S. To comply with the law, it formed a partnership with Bard College in New York and negotiated an agreement with the Hungarian government; however the government did not sign the deal.\n\nCEU said it had to announce it was moving its U.S.-accredited programs to Vienna on Monday in order to have time to recruit students for next year.\n\n\"CEU is not\u2026 an ordinary university, because it has a specific goal\u2026 to educate people from the region and from central Asia and so on, for them to go back and democratize,\" Felix Bender, a Ph.D. student in political science at the university, told CBS News. \"It's really ironic that the country that they're in is kicking them out for those reasons.\"\n\nThe European Commission said it was \"deeply concerned\" by CEU's move. It is expected to put additional pressure on Orban's allies in the European Parliament to isolate him. In September, European lawmakers voted to begin proceedings to punish Hungary for potentially violating democratic norms, partially in response to the government's moves against CEU.\n\n\"Other countries\u2026 have been closely observing the situation and checking how far one can go in silencing opposition and academics,\" Bender says. \"Now they know: There is no opposition to such methods coming from the side of the EU. And this worries me.\"\n\nThe Hungarian government dismissed criticism on Monday, however.\n\n\"The Soros university is leaving but staying,\" Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, tweeted. \"It's common knowledge that a significant number of its courses will still be held in Budapest.

Realizing he had erred, he has vowed to chart a new course and is bringing the rest of the church leadership along with him.\n\nThe summit is meant as a tutorial for church leaders to learn the importance of preventing sex abuse in their churches, tending to victims and investigating the crimes when they occur.\n\nIn the keynote speech, Manila Cardinal Luis Tagle choked up several times as told the bishops that the wounds the scandal has caused among the faithful recalled the wounds of Christ on the cross.

Kristi King, a senior clinical dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, acknowledges that while not everyone who eats raw cookie dough will get sick, the risk is very real.\n\n\"Raw cookie dough contains both raw agriculture and animal products, both of which can carry bacteria which may be harmful to us,\" she told CBS News. \"If you eat raw cookie dough, it's not to say you will absolutely get sick, but you raise your risk significantly in taking that gamble.\"\n\nOne of the major ingredients in dough, flour, typically hasn't been treated to kill harmful germs like E. coli. The grains that flour is made from can be contaminated while still in the field or at other steps as flour is produced. Cooking the flour will kill these germs but they can be present in flour's raw form.\n\nIn 2016, an E. coli outbreak linked to raw flour made 63 people sick. Since flour has a long shelf life, the CDC warns people may still have the contaminated products in their home. If you have any of the recalled flour products, do not use them and throw them away.\n\nAdditionally, raw eggs in cookie dough or batter can contain salmonella. While eggs are perfectly safe to eat when handled and cooked properly, they can make you sick if the eggs are contaminated and are eaten raw or lightly cooked.\n\nNew York City shop sells raw cookie dough without the risk\n\nAccording to the CDC, each year 48 million people in the U.S. get sick from a foodborne illness, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die.\n\nWhile there is not a breakdown of how many of these illnesses are caused by people eating raw cookie dough, the symptoms aren't pleasant.\n\n\"Flour is a known culprit for carrying E. coli in which symptoms may appear three to four days after consuming the product and can result in fever, cramping, bloody diarrhea, and vomiting,\" King said. \"Raw eggs are known for carrying salmonella and this bug tends to be more quick-acting, usually six to 48 hours after consumption, and results in cramping, fever, and diarrhea. In some cases, foodborne illnesses can lead to death.\"\n\nChildren, especially those under the age of 5, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems due to medical conditions are at a heightened risk of complications and death from food poisoning.\n\nIn order to avoid illness, experts recommend not eating raw dough or batter \u2014 no matter how tempting it may be.\n\n\"It's the holiday season, we all have places to go and people to see and don't want to be stuck at home ill, so just say 'no' to the dough and eat the baked good instead,\" King said.\n\nThe CDC also recommends the following:\n\nDo not let children play with or eat raw dough, including dough for crafts.\n\nFollow the recipe or package directions for cooking or baking at the proper temperature and for the specified time.\n\nDo not make milkshakes with products that contain raw flour, such as cake mix.\n\nDo not use raw, homemade cookie dough in ice cream. (Cookie dough ice cream sold in stores contains dough that has been treated to kill harmful bacteria.)\n\nKeep raw foods such as flour or eggs separate from ready-to eat-foods.

And when it comes to prevention and treatment, there are plenty of misconceptions that go around.\n\nHere, experts separate fact from myth and clear up eight common misconceptions about cold and flu.\n\nMyth 1: The flu is just a bad cold\n\nWhile some people may use the words cold and flu interchangeably, they are in fact very different. Flu is a much more serious illness than the common cold.\n\n\"People need to understand that the flu is serious and can turn deadly,\" Dr. Melissa Stockwell, associate professor of pediatrics and population and family health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told CBS News. \"The CDC just released data that last flu season 80,000 Americans died from flu.\"\n\nWill this flu season be as bad as last year's?\n\nWhile some of the symptoms of cold and flu may overlap, experts say the big way to tell the difference is how they begin. Colds tend to start gradually while flu will often make you feel like you got hit by a bus.\n\n\"With influenza, it hits you very hard, very suddenly,\" said Dr. Alan Taege, an infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic. \"You feel like all of a sudden something happened today. You feel achy, you're tired, and your symptoms are more severe.\"\n\nThe flu is also typically accompanied by a high-grade fever of 102 to 104 degrees F. With most colds, you won't get a high fever, Taege said.\n\nMyth 2: You can get the flu from the flu shot\n\nSome people put off or refuse to get vaccinated against the flu because they fear they will get the flu from the shot. This is simply not possible, experts explain.\n\n\"The flu vaccine is not a live virus,\" Taege said. \"You cannot become infected from the vaccine itself.\"\n\nWhile some people may experience mild symptoms after a flu shot, this can be attributed to other reasons, he explains.\n\nFor example, the flu vaccine takes two weeks to become fully effective so it's possible someone could be exposed to the virus or some other illness-causing germ during that time period or right before getting vaccinated.\n\nIt's also possible that the body is having a reaction to the vaccine, leaving some people feeling fatigued and achy.\n\n\"Your immune system is recognizing that there's something there that shouldn't be and it's mounting a response,\" Taege said.\n\nMyth 3: I got a flu shot last year so I don't need to get another one\n\nThe CDC recommends everyone age 6 months and older get vaccinated against the flu every year. Getting a flu vaccine one year does not make you immune to the following year's flu virus.\n\nAn annual flu vaccine is needed for two reasons. The first is because the human body's immune response from vaccination declines over time so a yearly vaccine is needed for optimal protection.\n\nSecond, since different strains of the flu circulate each year and are constantly changing, the formulation of the flu shot is reviewed and updated each year to keep up with changing flu viruses.\n\nPediatricians recommend flu shots for kids\n\nMyth 4: Loading up on vitamins can ward off colds and flu\n\nWhen some people feel a cold coming on, they immediately load up on vitamin C to \"nip it in the bud.\" Unfortunately, there is no scientific proof that vitamins can help prevent a cold or flu.\n\n\"Maintaining rest, hydration, good nutrition all along is important,\" Taege said, \"but flooding yourself with vitamins at the time you think you're having an onset of an illness, is not going to prevent it to the best of our knowledge.\"\n\nThere is some research to support taking oral zinc tablets to help shorten the length of a cold.\n\nHowever, Stockwell warns that such supplements can lead to side effects like nausea and gastrointestinal issues and can also interact with other medication. She suggests speaking with your doctor or pharmacist before taking supplements, especially if you are taking other medications.\n\nMyth 5: Exercising while sick helps you \"sweat out\" the germs\n\nDespite assertions that it's possible to \"sweat out\" cold or flu germs, that notion is just \"simply false,\" Taege said.\n\n\"Exercising yourself to the point of fatigue with significant exertion while you're ill is not a good idea. It's not going to make it go away more quickly,\" he said. \"What you need to do is be sure that you're staying hydrated and resting.\"\n\nDetermining whether or not you are well enough to work out depends on a few factors.\n\nIf you have a mild cold with an upper respiratory symptoms, such as a runny nose, Stockwell says it would probably be OK to exercise, though she recommends taking it slowly and stopping if symptoms worsen.\n\nHowever, if you have lower respiratory symptoms, including cough or chest congestion, or if you have a fever, definitely steer clear of the gym. Not only will you spread germs to others, you can make your illness worse.\n\n\"With the fever there is a concern over a potential link for myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle. So it's really important that if you have a fever you do not work out,\" Stockwell said.\n\nMyth 6: You can still get the flu even if you got the flu shot, so there's no point in getting vaccinated\n\nYes, it is still possible to become sick with the flu even if you've gotten a flu shot. However, that's no reason to skip the vaccine \u2014 experts say some protection is better than none.\n\nThe flu vaccine is formulated each year to match the strains of the virus that health officials believe are most likely to circulate in the months ahead.\n\n\"Every year scientists make their best educated guess about what they think the strains that will be circulating will be,\" Stockwell said. \"They do this by looking at the other hemisphere, which gets flu at the opposite time of year, and looking at patterns. Often times it's a good match, but sometimes it's not the best match.\"\n\nYou may get sick with the flu if a different strain is circulating than what was included in the vaccine that year. However, even if in a year when the vaccine isn't a good match, it still offers the best available protection against flu.\n\n\"What I tell my patients is that even a low effectiveness is better than zero percent, and if you don't get vaccinated at all, your effectiveness is basically zero,\" Stockwell said.\n\nAdditionally, research shows that people who become sick with the flu experience less severe symptoms if they were vaccinated versus those who were not.\n\nMyth 7: Going out in the cold weather without a coat will give you the flu\n\nWhile illnesses from colds and flu are more common in the winter, the chilly temperature actually has nothing to do with whether or not you get sick.\n\n\"Being out in the cold really has no direct influence,\" Taege said. \"There has to be some exposure to the virus. So if you haven't been in contact with someone who's sick or with the virus itself, going outside without a proper jacket and hat on in 10 degrees F will make you cold, but it's not going to give you influenza.\"\n\nMyth 8: I'm young and healthy so I don't need to bother getting the flu shot\n\nThe flu can strike anyone at any age and lead to severe illness. While complications are more common in very young children, the very old, and in people with compromised immune systems, healthy young people can still be affected.\n\n\"As we've seen with the last few rounds of influenza in recent years, young people get severe influenza and some young people have died because of it,\" Taege said.\n\nGetting the flu shot doesn't just protect you \u2014 it also helps protect others by reducing the risk of spreading the virus to more vulnerable populations like babies and young children, older adults, and people with certain chronic health conditions.\n\nWhat else you can do to prevent getting sick\n\nIn addition to getting the flu shot, the CDC recommends the following steps to avoid illness this cold and flu season:\n\nTry to avoid close contact with sick people.\n\nIf you are sick, limit contact with others as much as possible.\n\n\n\nIf you have the flu, stay home\n\n\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth as germs spread this way.\n\nCover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and then throw the tissue away."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dreams-could-be-early-clue-to-parkinsons-disease-alan-alda-diagnosed/", "text": "Actor Alan Alda revealed that he has Parkinson's disease \u2014 and in an interview Tuesday on \"CBS This Morning,\" the award-winning actor said an unusual dream helped lead to his diagnosis.\n\nAlda, best known for his portrayal of Army Capt. \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in the TV series \"M*A*S*H, was diagnosed three and a half years ago after experiencing a lesser-known early sign of Parkinson's. He said he asked his doctor to test him for the disease after reading an article about how physically acting out your dreams can be one of the earliest precursors of the neurological disorder.\n\n\"I asked for a scan because I thought I might have it,\" Alda said. \"I read an article by Jane Brody in The New York Times that indicated that if you have \u2014 if you act out your dreams, there's a good chance that might be a very early symptom, where nothing else shows.\" He recognized that it had happened to him.\n\n\"By acting out your dreams, I mean I was having a dream where someone was attacking me and I threw a sack of potatoes at them, and what I was really doing was throwing a pillow at my wife,\" Alda explained.\n\nAt that point, he had no other sign of illness. \"The doctor said, 'Why do you want a scan? You don't have any symptoms,'\" Alda recalled. \"And I said, I want to know if there's anything I can do \u2014 I want to do it.\"\n\nThe importance of catching Parkinson's early\n\nApproximately 1 million people in the United States have Parkinson's. While most people can recognize the telltale signs of later stages of the disease, such as tremors and a shuffling walk, earlier signs can be much more difficult to pinpoint.\n\nCatching the disease in its early stages can be beneficial for a number of reasons, says Dr. Claire Henchcliffe, director of the Parkinson's Disease & Movement Disorders Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian.\n\n\"There are modifiable lifestyle factors that could make a difference, for example exercising and diet \u2014 while these are not proven to delay onset of Parkinson's there is considerable optimism about their role,\" she told CBS News. \"Making the diagnosis also means if that person wants to get involved in clinical studies then they can make a real contribution to developing better understanding of and treatments for Parkinson's.\"\n\nSleep disorders and Parkinson's\n\nHenchcliffe notes that it's been well documented that sleep disturbances, including having problems falling asleep or staying asleep, restless legs syndrome, and other sleep disorders, are common in people with Parkinson's. Over the years there's been some debate over whether sleep trouble is a complication of Parkinson's or a precursor of the disease \u2014 an early warning sign that surfaces well before other symptoms set it.\n\n\"What's really turned out to be a critical link is the recognition that certain specific sleep disorders [such as REM sleep behavior disorder, or RBD], not only affect people with Parkinson's but in fact show up in some cases many years earlier than the movement symptoms that lead to diagnosis,\" Henchcliffe said. \"So while for some types of sleep disturbances we might still debate whether they are precursors or complications, for RBD there is now extremely strong evidence that it can be a harbinger of Parkinson's disease that will manifest some years down the line.\"\n\nREM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by people acting out their dreams, like Alda experienced. Examples of this might include dreaming that you're fighting off an attacker and actually punching out, or dreaming that you're hitting a ball on a tennis court and physically swinging your arm to make the stroke.\n\nCarlos L. Rodriguez, MD, a sleep medicine doctor at Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center, said he saw a patient with RBD several years ago who was dreaming that he was playing high school football again in the defensive end position. \"He had a clear avenue of attack straight to the quarter back and was rushing aggressively to tackle him when he awoke to find that his head had rammed through the drywall of his room,\" Rodriguez told CBS News.\n\nParkinson's disease: Risk factors and slowing its progression\n\nRodriguez explains that RBD is usually caused by neurodegeneration within the brainstem, which disables the mechanisms responsible for immobilizing muscles during REM sleep \u2014 the cycle of of sleep in which we dream. This is what enables someone to literally act out what's happening in their dreams.\n\n\"This neurodegeneration subsequently spreads to other regions of the central nervous system, and it is only after particular areas of the brain become affected that other symptoms and signs arise which permit recognition of the particular neurodegenerative disorder, like Parkinson's disease,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nThe sleep disorder has been connected to other neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy, and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease. In one small study of 26 patients with RBD, 80 percent went on to develop Parkinson's or another one of these diseases.\n\nHenchcliffe emphasizes that not everyone with RBD is destined to develop Parkinson's.\n\n\"But I do think that acting out dreams in RBD warrants a visit to a doctor to figure out what the cause may be,\" she said. \"There are a number of possible reasons for developing RBD, and of course we shouldn't forget about the practical issue of treating the symptoms if they're bad enough to be bothersome.\"\n\nOther early signs of Parkinson's\n\nFinding better ways to detect Parkinson's in its earliest stages is the subject of continuing research.\n\nA 2015 study published in The Lancet analyzed data on more than 54,000 British men and women and identified a number of symptoms that were more likely to appear in people who were later diagnosed with Parkinson's. These included tremor, trouble with balance, constipation, erectile and urinary dysfunction, low blood pressure, dizziness, fatigue, depression, and anxiety.\n\nLosing the sense of smell is another early indicator that a person may develop the disease, Henchcliffe said.\n\n\"Obviously, these are not highly specific, meaning there are many other possible reasons for having these symptoms,\" she said.\n\nStill, if you are concerned, talk to your doctor. \"A visit to a neurologist might uncover other factors that raise the concern for Parkinson's,\" Henchcliffe said, \"and although no one wants to get that news I do think it's good to be proactive.\"\n\nAlda said one of the reasons he decided to speak out about his medical condition was to send a message of hope to others who might be facing the disease. The 82-year-old is still extremely active, taking boxing lessons three times a week, and he recently launched a podcast called Clear+Vivid which explores all the ways people communicate with each other.\n\n\"In the very beginning, to be immobilized by fear and think the worst thing has happened to you \u2014 it hasn't happened to you. You still have things you can do,\" he said."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/snapchat-dysmorphia-selfies-driving-people-to-plastic-surgery-doctors-warn/", "text": "Plastic surgeons are sounding the alarm on a disturbing trend that's emerged with the growing popularity of social media: patients seeking cosmetic surgery to resemble how they see themselves in Snapchat filters.\n\nThe phenomenon, dubbed \"Snapchat dysmorphia,\" has people requesting fuller lips, bigger eyes, or a thinner nose in order to look like the filtered or photo-edited versions of themselves.\n\n\"This is an alarming trend because those filtered selfies often present an unattainable look and are blurring the line of reality and fantasy for these patients,\" researchers from Boston University School of Medicine's Department of Dermatology wrote in a recent article, published in the medical journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery.\n\nIn the past, photo-retouching technology was only widely available for models and celebrities for use in magazines and advertisements. But today, with apps like Snapchat and Facetune, one swipe gives everyone the power to smooth out skin, whiten teeth and make eyes and lips look bigger.\n\n\"Now, it is not just celebrities propagating beauty standards: it is a classmate, a coworker, or a friend. The pervasiveness of these filtered images can take a toll on one's self esteem, make one feel inadequate for not looking a certain way in the real world,\" the doctors write. They say it may even \"act as a trigger\" and lead to the development of body dysmorphic disorder, or BDD, a mental health condition in which a person is preoccupied with a nonexistent or minor flaw in their physical appearance.\n\nCould compulsive selfie-taking result in \"selfitis\"?\n\nThe authors say social media photo filters are altering people's perception of beauty worldwide.\n\nIn a statement, Snapchat said its filter were designed as a fun way to help lower the barrier to self-expression and storytelling on the app.\n\nDr. David Cangello, a plastic surgeon in New York City who was not involved with the JAMA report, says he's seen patients who seek cosmetic procedures in order to improve their appearance in selfies.\n\n\"There's a real heightened consciousness about appearance these days because of social media and because of having access to a camera at your finger tips so this is a real thing that's happening,\" he told CBS News.\n\nAnd he's not the only one. In recent years, the number of people seeking plastic surgery because they want to improve how they look in selfies has been increasing. A 2017 survey from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery sound that 55 percent of surgeons report seeing patients who mention selfies as a reason for requesting surgery, compared to 42 percent in 2015.\n\nFueling that trend may be the fact that selfies present a somewhat distorted view of a person's face. Research published in March showed that the close proximity of the camera can distort facial features \"like a funhouse mirror,\" for example by making the base of the nose appear approximately 30 percent wider. Such distortions could potentially prompt prolific selfie-takers to develop a skewed self-image.\n\nBefore the rise in the popularity of selfies, the most common complaint from people seeking rhinoplasty, commonly referred to as a nose job, was the hump of the dorsum of the nose. Now, plastic surgeons say nasal and facial asymmetry is the more common concern.\n\nThe Boston University authors warn that impact of digitally-perfected selfies may be especially harmful to young people.\n\nThey cite a recent study of adolescent girls that found that those who altered their photos more reported a higher level of concern with their bodies, and tended to overestimate their body shape and weight. The research also found that those with a dysmorphic body image tend to seek out social media as a means of validating their attractiveness. dy dissatisfaction.\n\nThe authors argue that doctors need to be aware of the implications social media can have for their patients' self-esteem and overall health.\n\n\"It can be argued that these apps are making us lose touch with reality because we expect to look perfectly primped and filtered in real life as well. Filtered selfies especially can have harmful effects on adolescents or those with BDD because these groups may more severely internalize this beauty standard,\" they write, adding that it's important for health care providers to take this into consideration when treating and counseling patients.\n\nCangello agrees that plastic surgeons have a responsibility to talk to patients about these potential issues.\n\n\"If you're an ethical and moral plastic surgeon, you really need to be able to screen these people to determine if somebody's coming in for the right reason and if they're mentally healthy enough to undergo a procedure,\" he said.\n\nCangello said there's also a few things users of the filtering apps should keep in mind. \"Fortunately, I think a lot of people do use [the filters] for fun, and that's a good thing,\" he said. \"The concern, of course, is when someone who does have a problem with self-image starts to use these things. You want people to know that they are who they are and they should be comfortable with that... and while there are certain things we can fix, some of the things that technology can fix in an image isn't realistic to have happen by an actual surgeon or physician.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/down-syndrome-iceland/", "text": "\"CBSN: On Assignment\" airs Mondays at 10 p.m. ET/PT on CBS and on our streaming network, CBSN. Explore more on this topic in our \"Behind the Lens\" report.\n\nWith the rise of prenatal screening tests across Europe and the United States, the number of babies born with Down syndrome has significantly decreased, but few countries have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland.\n\nSince prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women -- close to 100 percent -- who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy.\n\nWhile the tests are optional, the government states that all expectant mothers must be informed about availability of screening tests, which reveal the likelihood of a child being born with Down syndrome. Around 80 to 85 percent of pregnant women choose to take the prenatal screening test, according to Landspitali University Hospital in Reykjavik.\n\n\"CBSN: On Assignment\" headed to Iceland with CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano to investigate what's factoring into the high termination rates.\n\nUsing an ultrasound, blood test and the mother's age, the test, called the Combination Test, determines whether the fetus will have a chromosome abnormality, the most common of which results in Down syndrome. Children born with this genetic disorder have distinctive facial issues and a range of developmental issues. Many people born with Down syndrome can live full, healthy lives, with an average lifespan of around 60 years.\n\nOther countries aren't lagging too far behind in Down syndrome termination rates. According to the most recent data available, the United States has an estimated termination rate for Down syndrome of 67 percent (1995-2011); in France it's 77 percent (2015); and Denmark, 98 percent (2015). The law in Iceland permits abortion after 16 weeks if the fetus has a deformity -- and Down syndrome is included in this category.\n\nThe laboratory at Landspitali University Hospital, the country's main medical center, where the majority of Icelandic women's prenatal blood tests are processed. CBS News\n\nWith a population of around 330,000, Iceland has on average just one or two children born with Down syndrome per year, sometimes after their parents received inaccurate test results. (In the U.S., according to the National Down Syndrome Society, about 6,000 babies with Down syndrome are born each year.)\n\n\"Babies with Down syndrome are still being born in Iceland,\" said Hulda Hjartardottir, head of the Prenatal Diagnosis Unit at Landspitali University Hospital, where around 70 percent of Icelandic children are born. \"Some of them were low risk in our screening test, so we didn't find them in our screening.\"\n\nWhen Thordis Ingadottir was pregnant with her third child at the age of 40, she took the screening test. The results showed her chances of having a child with Down syndrome were very slim, odds of 1 in 1,600. However, the screening test is only 85 percent accurate. That year, 2009, three babies were born with Down syndrome in Iceland, including Ingadottir's daughter Agusta, who is now 7.\n\nAgusta, age 7. On average, Iceland has two people with Down syndrome born each year. CBS News\n\nAccording to Ingadottir, three babies born with Down syndrome is \"quite more than usual. Normally there are two, in the last few years.\" Since the birth of her daughter, Ingadottir has become an activist for the rights of people with Down syndrome.\n\nAs Agusta grows up, \"I will hope that she will be fully integrated on her own terms in this society. That's my dream,\" Ingadottir said. \"Isn't that the basic needs of life? What kind of society do you want to live in?\"\n\nGeneticist Kari Stefansson is the founder of deCODE Genetics, a company that has studied nearly the entire Icelandic population's genomes. He has a unique perspective on the advancement of medical technology. \"My understanding is that we have basically eradicated, almost, Down syndrome from our society -- that there is hardly ever a child with Down syndrome in Iceland anymore,\" he said.\n\nQuijano asked Stefansson, \"What does the 100 percent termination rate, you think, reflect about Icelandic society?\"\n\n\"It reflects a relatively heavy-handed genetic counseling,\" he said. \"And I don't think that heavy-handed genetic counseling is desirable. \u2026 You're having impact on decisions that are not medical, in a way.\"\n\nStefansson noted, \"I don't think there's anything wrong with aspiring to have healthy children, but how far we should go in seeking those goals is a fairly complicated decision.\"\n\nAccording to Hjartardottir, \"We try to do as neutral counseling as possible, but some people would say that just offering the test is pointing you towards a certain direction.\" Indeed, more than 4 out of 5 pregnant women in Iceland opt for the prenatal screening test.\n\nIceland's Down syndrome dilemma\n\nFor expectant mother Bergthori Einarsdottir, who chose to have the test, knowing that most women did so helped steer her decision. \"It was not pressure, but they told me that most women did it,\" she said. \"It did affect me maybe a little bit.\"\n\nOver at Landspitali University Hospital, Helga Sol Olafsdottir counsels women who have a pregnancy with a chromosomal abnormality. They speak to her when deciding whether to continue or end their pregnancies. Olafsdottir tells women who are wrestling with the decision or feelings of guilt: \"This is your life \u2014 you have the right to choose how your life will look like.\"\n\nShe showed Quijano a prayer card inscribed with the date and tiny footprints of a fetus that was terminated.\n\nQuijano noted, \"In America, I think some people would be confused about people calling this 'our child,' saying a prayer or saying goodbye or having a priest come in -- because to them abortion is murder.\"\n\nOlafsdottir responded, \"We don't look at abortion as a murder. We look at it as a thing that we ended. We ended a possible life that may have had a huge complication... preventing suffering for the child and for the family. And I think that is more right than seeing it as a murder -- that's so black and white. Life isn't black and white.

You can't help but think about all of the frightening reports over the last few years saying how easily people can become addicted to prescription opioids.\n\nIf you have a child or teen that needs the powerful pain drugs, it can make things feel even scarier.\n\nPublic health reports and study after study have shown that powerful prescription pain medications are a root cause for the current opioid crisis in the U.S. Opioid overdoses killed more than 33,000 people in 2015 and nearly half of overdose deaths involved prescription drugs, according to recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDoctors say that while there's often good reason for a patient to be prescribed drugs like OxyContin, Vicodin or Percocet for a period of time, these pills come with serious risks.\n\n\"When someone is legitimately and appropriately prescribed an opioid, they can become dependent,\" addiction psychiatrist Dr. Laurence Westreich, an associate professor at New York University, told CBS News.\n\n\"Some people have chronic pain and opioids feel good. They help with anxiety -- a lot of people say they give a general feeling of well-being,\" he explained.\n\nWestreich and other medical experts talked with CBS News about what to expect when it comes to using prescription opioids to manage severe pain and how to talk with your doctor and educate yourself ahead of time in order to help avoid the slippery slope of opioid addiction.\n\nBefore surgery\n\nIt's more important than ever that you have a frank discussion with your doctor ahead of surgery about what he or she is giving you for pain control afterward and how long you should expect to be on it, said Dr. John Renner, vice-chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Addiction Psychiatry and a professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine.\n\n\"No one's recommending you withhold pain medications from someone having surgery or other major medical problems,\" Renner told CBS News, but he said research now shows physicians have too freely prescribed opioid painkillers over the last decade.\n\nCDC cracking down on opioid prescriptions\n\nNarcotics are routinely prescribed for everything from wisdom tooth extractions in teens to joint replacement surgeries in the elderly, Renner said. Prescriptions for opioids have nearly quadrupled since 1999, according to the CDC. Overdose deaths have quadrupled since then, too.\n\nAbout 80 percent of the world's prescription opioids are used by the U.S., where 207 million opioid prescriptions were issued in 2013, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nKids are extremely vulnerable. The journal Pediatrics reported recently that most American teenagers who abuse opioid drugs first received the pills from a doctor.\n\n\"Physicians were not aware of how high the risks were with opiate medications. The information in the literature was not accurate and helpful and the advertising by the pharmaceutical industry was far too aggressive. You had this unfortunate combination of too aggressive marketing and bad information for physicians and that led to problems,\" said Renner.\n\nIn younger people, opioids may have a social appeal, while in the elderly, they may help ease chronic pain or anxiety and depression, Renner said. What people don't understand is that it takes more and more of the drugs over time to provide the same pain-relieving effects.\n\nBefore starting them, you need a plan, agreed Dr. Aleksey Lazarev, an orthopedic surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nCDC urges doctors to back off opioid painkiller prescriptions\n\n\"I outline expectations, including the amount of pain they will have post-operatively. I have that discussion pre-operatively. I explain that you will be in some pain after surgery and that it's acute and not expected to last more than three to five days and with each day it will get better and better,\" said Lazarev.\n\nIn the operating room, he almost always injects the incision site with a lidocaine medication that numbs the area to help with post-operative pain. Lazarev also prescribes short-acting narcotics for a few days, usually no more than 20 pills.\n\n\"I don't give any refills,\" he said.\n\nBut not all doctors do the same. One Mayo Clinic study found that 21 percent of patients meant to receive only short-term opioids end up getting prescriptions that extend for as much as three to four months. Another 6 percent continued the medications for longer than four months.\n\nEven medical professionals are at risk. Renner said he was given a 30-day supply of opioids after a procedure last year, which was far too much.\n\nIn the pre-surgery conversation, Lazarev also emphasizes to his patients that within a few days after surgery they need to begin tapering off the prescription pain medicine by alternating it with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Motrin or Alleve, and using ice on the affected area. Some orthopedic surgeons recommend patients use a cooling machine, which works by pumping icy water through pads that can be wrapped around an injured joint -- a knee that's just undergone ACL surgery, for example.\n\n\"A combination of those things really makes a difference,\" said Lazarev.\n\nPatients should share their medical histories beforehand and doctors should ask about any previous or current smoking, drinking or drug habits. People with a history of smoking or drug abuse appear to be at a greater risk for addiction, the Mayo Clinic study suggested.\n\nWashington city sues Oxycontin maker for citizens' opioid problems\n\nA history of depression or other mental health issues may also make a patient more vulnerable to addiction to prescription narcotics, research shows.\n\nAnother precaution doctors can take: check medical databases. In New York, physicians are mandated to use a centralized computerized system to look up a patient's prescription history before prescribing opioids, Lazarev said.\n\n\"To look for multiple prescriptions. We do see it more than you'd think. People do shop for doctors. They go to different offices and hospital systems. In New York State, I can look up every patient and see if there is any suspicious practice going on. If they had surgery one year ago and had one prescription for Percocet that's not a problem, but if I see different physicians prescribing for different medications in different zip codes, that's a red flag. There were times I did not perform the surgery because they had this practice of medication shopping,\" said Lazarev.\n\nTaking opioids may not be necessary for some procedures, and it's important to ask your health care provider if you really need them, especially if you have a history of addiction or mental health problems, Westreich said.\n\n\"Opioids are much overused for dental procedures. Most can be managed with NSAIDs such as Motrin or Naproxen or Tylenol,\" Westreich said. \"People need to challenge their treating physicians and tell them.\"\n\nAfter surgery\n\nWithin a few days after surgery, most patients can manage pain during the day with NSAIDs, and ice and elevation if it's an orthopedic injury, but taking a prescription opioid may help at bedtime if they're having trouble falling asleep due to pain, Lazarev said.\n\nPhysical therapy usually starts within a week after orthopedic surgery and can include ultrasound, soft tissue manipulation and massage, which can also treat discomfort and pain. Acupuncture is also used effectively in some people with pain.\n\nFirst response to back pain not medication, study says\n\nBut if you're still popping pain pills after a week, talk with your doctor about the safest way to wean off of them. The longer they're taken, the greater the risk for addiction.\n\nIn people without cancer who were prescribed opioids for pain by a physician, about 6 percent of those who got as little as a single day's supply of a narcotic painkiller were still on an opioid a year later, a recent CDC report found. The odds of long-term opioid use jumped to about 13 percent for patients who took the drugs for eight days or more, the CDC reported.\n\nThe odds of chronic opioid use and addiction increase when a second prescription is given or refilled.\n\nResearch also shows people who start taking a long-acting opioid or tramadol (Ultram) are more likely to stay on opioids than those given hydrocodone (Vicodin) or oxycodone (Oxycontin).\n\nWarning signs\n\nHow do you know if you're beginning to have dependency problems with medication?\n\n\"If you're taking it for longer than is recommended,\" Westreich said.\n\nOther signs of addiction: you're taking time to seek out more medication, dropping important obligations because of it, or skipping school or work well past the timetable your doctor said you'd be recovered.\n\nMemory problems and trouble focusing can be warning signs, too. And if you find yourself going to different doctors for more medication because you're doctor won't keep prescribing it, then a problem exists, said Westreich.\n\nIf possible, ask a friend or family member to help you through your recovery period and track how much pain medication you're taking, making sure you're following the recommended dosing.\n\nKentucky paramedics rush to as many as 25 drug overdoses a day\n\n\"People get into denial. They can have a lack of insight into what they're doing. Family members should use common sense. If you see the person really focused on the medication and lethargic or sleepy, don't believe what they say if they think they need more medication,\" he said.\n\nFamily and friends of patients who've had past addiction or alcohol problems need to be especially watchful. If you're worried, call the prescribing physician and an addiction specialist and ask them to work together, he said. Better yet, call them ahead of surgery and ask them to collaborate on the patient's pain control plan.\n\n\"We work together to make sure a person gets an appropriate amount of pain control. They will need more medication during treatment often -- because they have a higher tolerance for opioids -- and there's no problem with doing that, giving two to three days of heavier opioid medication and then tapering down over the next week,\" said Westreich.\n\nBe sure and dump your leftover pills, said Renner. Many states have special days of the year when you can turn opioids and other prescription drugs in to your local police station or pharmacy. But Renner said if those days are months away, don't leave the medication around the house where children could find them.\n\nToddler fatalities linked to opioids have steadily increased over the last 10 years according to the CDC. In 2000, 14 children in the U.S. under age 5 died after ingesting opioids, but by 2015, the number climbed to 51. The children find the drugs and ingest them, possibly thinking the pills are candy. Just one opioid pill can lead to a lethal dose for a 35-pound child.\n\nRenner said pills can be disposed of by crushing and mixing them with coffee grounds, then throwing the inedible mixture in the trash. Another option, Westreich said, is flushing them down the toilet.\n\n\"I understand the public health issues of not wanting them to wash into the water system and affect wildlife,\" he said, but keeping them around is potentially more dangerous.\n\nNone of the experts believe people in pain after surgery, or dealing with pain from another serious medical condition like cancer, should go without prescription pain medicines.\n\n\"It's silly to say opioids are evil. Pain needs to be treated,\" Westreich said, but thoughtful prescribing, patient education, and alternative pain control methods are key to reducing the risk."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/foods-that-help-keep-the-brain-young/", "text": "Blueberries, olive oil, kefir, walnuts, leafy greens, oatmeal, bananas, and algal oil. These are some of the foods that could play a role in helping to keep the brain healthy throughout life, according to scientific experts interviewed by CBS News.\n\nThe brain is the \"motherboard of reality,\" said Dr. Joel Salinas, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"The better we can take care of this organ that is so deeply tied to who we are as a person, to this universe that we exist in, the more fulfilling of a life we'll be able to live.\"\n\n\"Brain health\" encompasses a person's ability to remember things as well as avoidance of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, said Francine Grodstein, Sc.D., a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Dementia is a broad term referring to a decline in mental ability, including problems with memory, communication, focus, and reasoning. Although dementia is more common in older adults, it is not part of the normal aging process. Alzheimer's disease, which affects about 5.5 million Americans, is the most common type of dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nBut doctors and scientists still have much to learn about how our eating habits may affect brain health.\n\n\"It's important to emphasize that research and understanding of the possible impact of diet on brain health is a relatively new field,\" Grodstein said.\n\nYet even as that work continues, a person is never too young to start caring for their brain health, said Salinas. \"Much like we brush our teeth every day\u2026 and see a dentist regularly, we should place that same kind of value on our brains,\" he said.\n\nKeeping the bacteria happy\n\nOatmeal, pulpy orange juice, bran cereal, bananas, fruit smoothies from unpeeled fruits, and other fiber-containing foods are all prebiotics.\n\n\"Prebiotics means fiber and roughage that's helping to promote the growth of the beneficial bacteria in your gut. It's making the existing bacteria in your gut happy,\" explained Rudy Tanzi, Ph.D., a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and director of the Alzheimer's Genome Project.\n\nAlzheimer's expert shares healthy brain advice\n\nProbiotic foods include yogurt, kefir (a liquid yogurt), and fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, and kimchi. Probiotic supplements also contain billions of live bacteria.\n\n\"Probiotics are actually adding bacteria to your gut that's beneficial, the types of bacteria you see on the back of your yogurt cup,\" according to Tanzi. \"You want to add both prebiotics and probiotics to your diet.\"\n\nOur intestines are filled with bacteria that are a normal part of the digestive process. The large intestine has the most bacteria and is where the \"gut controls inflammation in the brain,\" Tanzi said.\n\nPrebiotic and probiotic foods can reduce harmful inflammation in the brain, called neuroinflammation, said Tanzi. \"First and foremost is keeping the bacteria in your gut happy.\"\n\nBlueberries\n\n\"There is exciting preliminary evidence of blueberries for brain health.\" said Grodstein. Blueberries have high levels of flavonoids, a compound in food that reduces oxidation in the body. Over time, oxidation can damage cells and contribute to aging.\n\nBlueberries help \"fight inflammation,\" according to Tanzi.\n\nBerries are also on the list of foods that Salinas recommends to his patients. \"Overall, what I tell people who come to me in clinic is you want to eat a diet that's high in fish, berries, leafy greens, and whole grains.\"\n\nAnd even the experts eat berries. \"I have started eating lots of berries and more nuts in recent years,\" said Grodstein.\n\nGreen, leafy vegetables\n\nGreen, leafy vegetables such as romaine, arugula, kale, collard greens, broccoli, spinach, and Swiss chard are among the foods that support brain health.\n\n\"Across several studies there is fairly consistent findings that green, leafy vegetables do seem to be related to decreased risk of cognitive impairments or dementia,\" said Grodstein.\n\nVegetables are also a key component of the MIND Diet. Developed by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, the MIND diet was shown to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in one study.\n\nMIND stands for \"Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.\" It bases its healthy food choices on principles of the Mediterranean diet and the heart-healthy DASH diet, both of which are grounded in scientific research.\n\nNuts, olive oil and other healthy fats\n\nThe experts recommended replacing saturated fats from red meat with fats from fish, tree nuts, and healthy oils. The better-for-your-brain options include salmon, tuna, walnuts, pistachios, almonds, olive oil, and algae oil.\n\n\"People whose diets have more fish in them do seem to be less likely to develop memory problems,\" said Grodstein.\n\nCertain fish and nuts contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, a specific type of fat that has been shown to provide health benefits, including reducing neuroinflammation, according to Tanzi.\n\nReplacing saturated fat with healthier fat for your heart\n\n\"There's good evidence that these omega-3 fatty acids help to lower LDL, the 'bad cholesterol' that increases risk of stroke or heart attack,\" said Dean Hartley, Ph.D., director of science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association. \"With my diet, I do try to go more toward the Mediterranean diet, including things like olive oil and salmon.\"\n\nA word of warning from Dr. Tanzi: Fish oil supplements are sometimes contaminated with heavy metals, which can actually end up killing cells in the brain.\n\n\"Fish oil comes from fatty fish, which live in the ocean. Our oceans are now unfortunately contaminated with heavy metals like mercury, cesium, cadmium, and lead,\" said Tanzi.\n\n\"You can gamble and hope you're buying the best possible fish oil, or you can buy a vegan, omega-3 supplement that comes from algae. And you aren't going to get the heavy metals, because it's not coming from fish.\"\n\nTanzi recommends an algal oil supplement high in DHA and EPA. \"Those are the compounds you really need.\"\n\nFasting and eating less\n\nResearch on animals has shown that caloric restriction \u2013 eating fewer calories in a strategic way \u2013 helps prevent several diseases, but there isn't enough evidence to recommend fasting as a preventative measure for brain health, according to Hartley.\n\nSalinas agrees. \"I think the verdict is still out with regard to fasting.\"\n\n\"In fact, one of the problems that we often see is that people with Alzheimer's disease have a failure to thrive,\" said Hartley. \"They are not necessarily able to take in the proper calories.\"\n\nAlthough the effects of fasting and caloric restriction on brain health aren't fully understood in people, limiting food to a certain extent may improve other aspects of health, according to Josh Mitteldorf, Ph.D., an independent scientist who writes about aging and evolutionary biology. He's the author of \"Cracking the Aging Code: The New Science of Growing Old \u2013 And What It Means for Staying Young.\"\n\n\"The body is trying to kill itself,\" said Mitteldorf. \"Aging is programmed into our genes.\" He argues that, like the surge of growth hormones in our youth and sex hormones during puberty, there are genes that get \"turned on\" during the twilight of life that serve to age and ultimately kill us. \"This is done with programmed cell death. It's done with inflammation. It's done by shutting down the immune system, which is so important to protecting us.\"\n\nHow does one slow down that aging process? \"You've got to find some way convince the body not to kill itself,\" said Mitteldorf. \"Natural approaches to anti-aging is an oxymoron\u2026. You're going to have to trick the body.\"\n\nPeriodic fasting might be one way to \"trick the body\" into living longer, he suggested. But how much longer? \"My guess is five years,\" said Mitteldorf."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gluten-free-diet-without-a-medical-reason-heart-health/", "text": "Eating \"gluten-free\" when there's no medical need to do so won't boost your heart health -- and might even harm it, a new study warns.\n\nGluten-free diets have soared in popularity in recent years. But, shunning gluten has no heart benefits for people without celiac disease, and it may mean consuming a diet lacking heart-healthy whole grains, according to the quarter-century study.\n\n\"For the vast majority of people who can tolerate it, restricting gluten to improve your overall health is likely not to be a beneficial strategy,\" said study leader Dr. Andrew Chan.\n\nGluten-free craze: Health fad or healthy diet?\n\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. People with celiac disease -- less than 1 percent of the U.S. population -- have an immune system reaction when they eat gluten, triggering inflammation and intestinal damage. They also have an increased risk of heart disease, but that declines after they begin eating a gluten-free diet, according to background information in the study.\n\nRecently, researchers have reported that some people may have what's known as non-celiac gluten sensitivity, a condition that's not totally understood.\n\n\"I don't want to dismiss the fact that there are people who have the sensitivity,\" said Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBut, the rest of the population should not think that going gluten-free will help their health -- at least not their heart health, he said.\n\nFor the study, Chan and his colleagues analyzed data on nearly 65,000 women and more than 45,000 men, all U.S. health professionals without a history of heart disease when the study started. The study participants completed a detailed food questionnaire beginning in 1986 and updated it every four years until 2010.\n\nThe researchers looked at gluten intake, dividing participants into five groups from low to high, then calculated how likely they were to develop heart disease over roughly 26 years.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the highest-intake gluten group with the lowest, the rates of heart disease were not very different.\n\nFDA sets guidelines for gluten-free labeling\n\nHowever, people with restricted gluten intake often eat a diet low in fiber-rich whole grains -- which are tied to lower heart risk -- and higher in refined grains, Chan said.\n\nSo, the researchers then adjusted their findings for intake of refined grains. \"It appeared that those individuals who consumed the lowest levels of dietary gluten had a 15 percent higher risk of heart disease,\" Chan said.\n\nBecause the study was observational, however, \"we can't say with certainty that this is a cause-and-effect association,\" Chan said.\n\nDr. Ravi Dave is a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles Geffen School of Medicine.\n\n\"Eating gluten-free is a big fad right now,\" said Dave, who wasn't involved in the study. \"There is a lot of hype about how gluten produces inflammation and can lead to giving you diabetes, heart disease, dementia, a lot of things.\"\n\nAlthough he finds this new study inconclusive, Dave agreed with the researchers: \"We should not recommend people who don't have gluten sensitivity or celiac disease go on a gluten-free diet,\" he said.\n\nDave also said the study left some questions unanswered. For instance, it doesn't reveal what the people who avoided gluten substituted. \"Were they picking a more unhealthy choice that put them at risk for heart disease?\" he wondered.\n\nFor people who still want or need to steer clear of gluten, Chan said it's important to obtain adequate amounts of fiber. Oats and brown rice are good sources of gluten-free fiber, he noted.\n\nThe study had no food industry funding.

They've developed a campaign to try to change the misperception, called \"Don't Wash Your Chicken.\"\n\n\"People are attached to the idea of washing raw poultry,\" Jennifer Quinlan, Associate Professor in the Nutrition Science Department at Drexel University, said in program materials. \"Some think they're cleaning off germs. Some just want to get slime off, or feel like it's dirty.\"\n\nMuch of the chicken purchased at the supermarket, regardless of which parts or whether or not it has skin, comes with campylobacter or salmonella bacteria. Neither cold or warm water, nor fruit acids will kill those bacteria, which can sometimes cause severe cases of food-borne illness.\n\nThe way to make chicken safe to eat is to cook it thoroughly. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165 \u00b0F as measured with a food thermometer, according to FDA guidelines. Whether it's grilled, baked, fried or slow-cooked, it's the exposure to high heat that kills all the bacteria.\n\nThe \"Don't Wash Your Chicken\" program website says: \"If germs were visible to the naked eye, you would see that washing poultry just splashes bacteria all over you, your kitchen towels, your countertops, and any other food you have nearby, such as raw foods or salads. This can make people sick, especially young children, pregnant women, older adults and the immunocompromised.\"\n\nTo illustrate the risk, a mock infrared animation of \"Germ-vision\" shows how these tiny particles of bacteria can spray far and wide when chicken is washed \u2014 a process called aerosolization.\n\nQuinlan said she discovered how prevalent chicken washing is through the course of her research on the quality and safety of food in minority populations, as part of a USDA-funded program. Through surveys and focus groups in the Philadelphia area, the research team found that washing chicken before cooking was common to several groups. Expanded research showed that the practice is almost universal.\n\nThe goal of the campaign is to educate people about the dangers of spreading bacteria and cross-contaminating other foods by washing chicken.\n\nFor those who want to take an extra cleaning step to remove sliminess before cooking, the FDA recommends wiping chicken with a disposable paper towel. Then be careful to wash any utensils, plates, cutting boards or kitchen counters that came in contact with raw chicken to avoid spreading the bacteria while you finish cooking."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/refrigeration-not-essential-for-all-perishable-foods/", "text": "Refrigerators can help plenty of foods last longer, but many people don't know that not every perishable needs to be kept in the cold.\n\nChef Rachel Reuben of Food Fix Kitchen makes her living teaching others how to cook. Reuben says one of the most important lessons she provides involves guidance on which foods need to be refrigerated, especially when it comes to produce.\n\n\"I think we assume everything will do better in the refrigerator but that's not really true,\" Reuben told CBS News.\n\nKnowing what food should and shouldn't be left to chill can ensure that what you eat maintains its quality, she explains.\n\nWhile the cold can prevent many fruits and vegetables from going bad, that doesn't mean they'll taste as good or will be as healthy. \"They will lose nutrients and flavor in the refrigerator,\" Reuben said.\n\nIn the fridge, tomatoes lose their texture and potatoes can become gritty. Reuben believes other foods like apples, onions, avocados and citrus fruits are better when kept at room temperature. Bananas should never be refrigerated because they turn black faster, she says.\n\nShould we be following food \"best by\" dates?\n\nBerries can also be kept out of the fridge but should be eaten quickly, which is why Reuben recommends buying them in smaller quantities.\n\nMany people refrigerate bread because there's a widespread belief that it will reduce mold growth. However, Reuben says that cold bread tends to dry out.\n\nReuben also pointed out one item most people don't refrigerate but probably should: nuts.

Poultry should be cooked to 165 degrees.\n\nPrewashed or precut fruits and vegetables - Marler notes that the more a food is handled, the more likely it is to become contaminated along the way.\n\nRaw or undercooked eggs - Raw eggs can spread salmonella.\n\nRaw oysters and other raw shellfish - Marler says as the climate warms, this is becoming a bigger problem; \"Oysters are filter feeders, so they pick up everything that's in the water. If there's bacteria in the water it'll get into their system, and if you eat it you could have trouble,\" he wrote.\n\nRaj agreed there's a lot of common sense behind these warnings.\n\nPrewashed bags of fruits, vegetables or salad are popular and convenient, but have been linked to a number of outbreaks of foodborne disease, including a recent spate of listeria cases tied to salads packaged at a Dole facility in Ohio.\n\nRaj said consumers don't have to avoid them completely, but take precautions. \"Don't necessarily trust the manufacturer that all the bacteria or viruses have been removed. Even if it says prewashed, go ahead and give it another wash.\"\n\nAs for raw or undercooked meat, \"Not a good idea,\" Raj said. \"There is a risk of E. coli there, other bacteria.

More than 93 million Americans are obese and millions more are overweight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a recent study from the Cleveland Clinic shows few people are actually doing anything about it.\n\nResearchers found that three-quarters of those they surveyed are concerned about their weight and 65 percent are worried about getting heart disease due to extra pounds. Yet, less than half actually tried to make any dietary changes to lose weight.\n\nThe findings also revealed that many Americans don't fully understand the relationship between extra weight and their overall health. Nearly 1 in 5 of those surveyed said they believe their diet has nothing to do with their heart health and more than half didn't know that obesity is linked to high \"bad\" cholesterol levels. Two-thirds said they didn't know being obese could lead to a stroke.\n\n\"Most Americans understand abstractly that being overweight or obese is not good for your health, but it seems we are not grasping that the leading causes of death and disability \u2014 stroke, cancer, coronary artery disease \u2014 are all adversely affected by increased weight,\" Steven Nissen, M.D., chairman of Cardiovascular Medicine at Cleveland Clinic, said in a statement. \"We need to do a better job of educating patients and the public about the major consequences of carrying excess weight and the benefits of losing weight.\n\nHe notes that a person only needs to lose 5 percent body weight to start seeing important health benefits.\n\nSo what's the best way to shed those extra pounds?\n\nSamantha Heller, a registered dietitian at NYU Langone Health, says while physical activity is important, it all starts with what we put on our plates.\n\n\"As much as I love exercise, diet is everything. It's not only how much you eat but it's the quality of food you eat that makes a difference,\" Heller told \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nDietary guidelines\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture's dietary guidelines for Americans emphasize a healthy eating plan that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as well as lean meats, fish, and beans.\n\nSpecifically, the USDA says most adults should be getting 3 to 5 servings of vegetables and 2 to 4 servings of fruit per day. Or put more simply, half your plate should be filled with produce.\n\nTrans fats, sodium, and added sugar should be limited.\n\nMediterranean diet\n\nWhile there is no one-size-fits-all diet that works for everyone, one eating plan that has been shown again and again to have scientifically proven health benefits is the Mediterranean diet. This heart-healthy diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, fish and whole grains, along with healthy fats like olive oil, nuts and avocados.\n\nA number of studies have shown the Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of heart disease and may have numerous other health benefits, including reduction of LDL, or \"bad,\" cholesterol, as well as a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and cancer. One study published in British Journal of Nutrition even found following a Mediterranean diet was associated with a 25 percent lower chance of death from any cause.\n\nDASH diet\n\nThe DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is another option to consider. The eating plan was originally designed to help manage blood pressure, but experts say it has many overall health benefits. The diet emphasizes healthy food sources, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, skinless poultry and fish, and nuts and legumes. It also limits red meat, salt, and sweets.\n\nThe DASH diet has been shown to help lower blood pressure, and research suggests it may also reduce the risk of diabetes and help fight depression.\n\nHealthy eating habits\n\nExperts recommend staying away from fad diets for weight loss, such as \"detox\" diets and the currently trendy ketogenic, or keto diet, as they are not sustainable in the long run.\n\nIn addition to following a healthy diet, scientific research has found certain habits may make it easier to shed extra pounds.\n\nA 2018 study published in the journal BMJ Open that tracked the eating habits of nearly 60,000 people found that eating more slowly, avoiding snacks after dinner, and not eating within two hours before going to bed were all linked to weight loss.\n\n\"I like the idea of closing the kitchen after dinner,\" Heller said.\n\nTo stay on track, she also recommends seeing a registered dietitian, who can help individualize a healthy eating plan that's going to work for you. She advises checking with your insurance to see if it's covered. A dietitian may also work with you on a sliding cost scale.\n\nFinally, Heller emphasizes the importance of planning ahead.\n\n\"Sit down with your family and plan what you're going to eat during the week,\" she said. \"That's going to help with food waste, save money, and get your kids and family involved in the shopping and prep.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/grand-canyon-radiation-tourists-reportedly-exposed-for-years-to-uranium/", "text": "Tourists visiting the Grand Canyon's museum collections building have been exposed to radiation for nearly two decades, the Arizona Republic reports.

Yet how depression might harm cognition isn't clear.\n\nOne possibility: Brain cells communicate by firing messages across connections called synapses. Generally, good cognition is linked to more and stronger synapses. With cognitive impairment, those junctions gradually shrink and die off. But until recently, scientists could count synapses only in brain tissue collected after death.\n\nYale University scientists used a new technique to scan the brains of living people \u2014 and discovered that patients with depression had a lower density of synapses than healthy people the same age.\n\nThe lower the density, the more severe the depression symptoms, particularly problems with attention and loss of interest in previously pleasurable activities, Yale neuroscientist Irina Esterlis said Thursday at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She wasn't studying just seniors but a range of ages including people too young for any cognitive changes to be obvious outside of a brain scan \u2014 on the theory that early damage can build up.\n\n\"We think depression might be accelerating the normal aging,\" she said.\n\nHow inflammation in the body could be causing depression\n\nHer studies so far are small. To prove if depression really worsens that decline would require tracking synaptic density in larger numbers of people as they get older, to see if and how it fluctuates over time in those with and without depression, cautioned Jovier Evans, a staff scientist at the National Institute on Mental Health.\n\nEsterlis is planning a larger study to do that. It's delicate research. Volunteers are injected with a radioactive substance that binds to a protein in the vesicles, or storage bins, used by synapses. Then during a PET scan, areas with synapses light up, allowing researchers to see how many are in different regions of the brain.\n\nEsterlis said there are no medications that specifically target the underlying synapse damage.\n\nBut other brain experts said the preliminary findings are a reminder of how important it is to treat depression promptly, so people don't spend years suffering.\n\n\"If your mood isn't enough to make you go and get treated, then hopefully your cognition is,\" said Dr. Mary Sano, who directs the Mount Sinai Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in New York and wasn't involved in the new research.\n\nStill, she cautioned that normal cognitive aging is a complicated process that involves other health problems, such as heart disease that slows blood flow in the brain. It might be that depression, rather than worsening synaptic decline, just makes it more obvious, Sano noted.\n\nWith depression \"at any age, there's a hit on the brain. At an older age the hit may be more visible because there may already be some loss,\" she explained.\n\nIndeed, another way the brain ages: The blood-brain barrier, which normally protects against infiltration of damaging substances, gradually breaks down, Daniela Kaufer of the University of California, Berkeley, told the AAAS meeting. That triggers inflammation, setting off a cascade that can cause cognitive impairment. Her lab found a specific molecular culprit and is developing, in studies with mice, a way to block the inflammatory damage.\n\nThe University of Toronto's Etienne Sibille is developing a compound to target yet another piece of the puzzle, brain receptors that are impaired with both aging and depression. Mouse studies showed it could reverse stress-induced memory loss, he said.

Only about 5 percent were found to be \"heavy\" consumers of artificially sweetened drinks.\n\nAfter taking into consideration a variety of stroke risk factors -- including blood pressure status, smoking history and age \u2014 the study team concluded that heavy consumption of diet drinks did appear to be tied to cardiovascular risks in a number of ways.\n\nFor example, those women who drank two or more diet beverages a day saw their overall risk for developing heart disease increase by 29 percent. They were also 16 percent more likely to die prematurely from any cause.\n\nCertain groups fared even worse: Among obese women and black women with no history of heart disease or diabetes, a diet drink habit pushed clot-driven stroke risk up by roughly twofold and fourfold, respectively, the researchers reported.\n\nWhether or not the findings would apply to either men or younger women remains unclear, the study authors noted.\n\nThe findings were published online Feb. 14 in the journal Stroke.\n\nLona Sandon is program director of the department of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nShe agreed that more research is needed to further explore a possible diet drink-heart disease connection. But for now Sandon offered simple advice: diet or regular, sodas offer no nutritional value other than calories.\n\n\"If they replace other drinks, such as milk and 100 percent fruit or vegetable drinks, then these women miss out on valuable nutrition for protecting the heart and vascular system,\" Sandon warned.\n\n\"The nutrition you are missing because you are drinking artificially sweetened beverages instead may be the real problem,\" she said.\n\nA group representing the artificial sweetener industry offered another caveat about the findings \u2014 that many women who drink diet drinks are already struggling with weight issues.\n\n\"It is likely study subjects were already at a greater health risk and chose low-calorie sweetened beverages to manage their calorie and sugar intake as these products are proven safe and beneficial for those managing their weight and blood glucose levels,\" said Robert Rankin, president of the Calorie Control Council.\n\n\"The contribution of reverse causality, meaning that individuals already at a greater risk of stroke and cardiovascular events chose low-calorie sweetened beverages, is very likely the cause of the associations presented by these researchers,\" the council added in a statement."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/camilla-duchess-of-cornwall-dangers-of-osteoporosis/", "text": "The Duchess of Cornwall is speaking out about osteoporosis, a condition she says contributed to her mother's death. Camilla, 71, marked the official launch of the Royal Osteoporosis Society at the Science Museum in London by sharing an anecdote about her late mother Rosalind, who died of the bone disease in 1994.\n\n\"It was 25 years ago that my mother died as a result of osteoporosis. In fact, she was exactly the same age that I am now. Then it was never discussed, rarely diagnosed and always attributed to old people,\" Camilla said, according to the royal couple's official Twitter account.\n\n'It was 25 years ago that my mother died as a result of osteoporosis.

It is a disease in which the density and quality of bone become weaker and brittle. As bones become more porous and fragile, a fall or even a mild stress like coughing or bending over can lead to a fracture.\n\nWorldwide, about 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men are at risk of a fracture related to osteoporosis, according to the International Osteoporosis Foundation. In fact, a fracture associated with osteoporosis occurs once every 3 seconds. The most common fractures occur in the hip, spine, and wrist.\n\nAs the disease progresses, bone loss occurs silently and often there are no symptoms until the first fracture occurs.\n\nWho is at risk for osteoporosis?\n\nSome people are at a greater risk of osteoporosis than others, for reasons they cannot control. Women, for example, are much more likely to develop the disease than men, as are people of white or Asian descent.\n\nThe risk of osteoporosis also increases with age. People who have a parent or sibling with osteoporosis are at a greater risk of the disease themselves, especially if a parent suffered a hip fracture. Both men and women with smaller body frames also have a higher risk since they may have less bone mass to draw from as they get older.\n\nOsteoporosis is more common in people with certain medical conditions, including thyroid problems, eating disorders, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, kidney or liver disease, cancer, Lupus, multiple myeloma, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nLifestyle habits can also increase the risk of osteoporosis, such as tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nHow do you die from osteoporosis?\n\nOsteoporosis can be fatal when it leads to dangerous falls and fractures.\n\nIn fact, a 2015 study found fractures due to osteoporosis can cause premature death in people 45 and older. The researchers followed more than 200,000 elderly patients over several years and found an increase in deaths among those who suffered fractures. Almost all bone fractures (apart from fingers and toes) were linked to an increased risk of dying when compared to other men and women of the same age who had not had a fracture.\n\n\"Common fractures like spinal fractures that cause older people to stoop over, arm, collarbone and wrist fractures from a simple fall, or pelvic fractures from a trip on the stairs or a slip on the ice all increase the risk of the sufferer dying in the next few years,\" study author Lyn March, MD, PhD, said in a statement.\n\nThe International Osteoporosis Foundation reports that a 50-year-old woman has the same risk of death related to a hip fracture as she does from dying of breast cancer.\n\nCan you prevent osteoporosis?\n\nIt's important to note that osteoporosis is not a normal part of aging and there are steps you can take throughout your life to protect your bones.\n\nGood nutrition and regular exercise are essential to maintaining good health and keeping bones strong, Protein and calcium in particular are building blocks of healthy bones. If you cannot get enough of these in your diet, you may want to talk to your doctor about taking supplements.\n\nAvoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake can also go a long way in protecting your bones."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hackers-steal-medical-records-sell-them-on-dark-web/", "text": "As health care providers store patients' medical records digitally, some have left their files vulnerable to being exposed \u2013 and even sold on the black market, or the internet's dark web.

Another posted an entire hospital's worth of files from a health care database in Georgia: 397,000 patient records.\n\nHow are they getting the records? One \"product description\" said \"breached a very large hospital recently.\"\n\n\"So they're basically saying, somebody hacked into this hospital, and here's the records if you want to buy them for 26 grand?\" Werner asked.\n\n\"Exactly, they want to monetize these records quickly, and they're actually offering them at a discount compared to other prices I've seen on the dark web,\" Miliefsky said.\n\nSocial Security numbers sell for $1, and credit card info goes for up to $110. But Experian reports full medical records can command up to $1,000 because they're an identity thief's dream: date of birth, place of birth, credit card details, Social Security number, address, and emails.\n\n\"So this is really all they need, if they buy this. And then they can become?\" Werner asked.\n\n\"You,\" Miliefsky said.\n\nHackers have stolen millions of records. A breach at Anthem Insurance affected 78 million people, and a hack at UCLA Health exposed more than four million patient records. Despite that, a 2017 survey of health care providers found just 16 percent reported having a fully functional cybersecurity program.\n\nAccording to Protenus, a firm that helps health care companies protect data, there were 222 hacking incidents last year \u2013 up nearly 25 percent from 2017. In all, more than 11 million patient records were affected.\n\n\"One of our most important missions is to mitigate that vulnerability as quickly as possible.

At least one person has gotten sick.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one case of an infection called brucellosis has been confirmed in New York. The individual consumed raw, unpasteurized milk from Miller's Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, Pennsylvania.\n\nInvestigators have determined that people in 19 states bought or consumed raw milk from the farm. The milk was sold in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.\n\nOfficials say an unknown number of people may have been exposed to the bacteria, Brucella strain RB51, from drinking the raw milk from this farm.\n\nBrucella is a harmful germ that can be passed from animals to humans. This particular type of Brucella is resistant to first-line drugs and can be difficult to diagnose because of limited testing options, the CDC says. Symptoms are similar to those of more common illnesses like flu, also making it difficult to catch.\n\nRB51 is a live, weakened strain used in vaccines to protect cows from more serious Brucella infections. In rare instances, cows receiving this vaccine can shed the bacteria in their milk. If the milk isn't pasteurized to kill the germs, people who consume it can become infected.\n\nThe New York case of brucellosis is the third known instance of human infection with RB51 associated with consuming raw milk or raw milk products produced in the United States. The other two cases were in October 2017 in New Jersey and in August 2017 in Texas. In addition to these three confirmed cases, officials say hundreds of other people were potentially exposed during the same period.\n\nSymptoms of brucellosis\n\nInitial symptoms of brucellosis (the illness caused by Brucella bacteria) include:\n\nFever\n\nSweats\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nHeadache\n\nFatigue\n\nMuscle and joint pain\n\nSymptoms can begin anywhere from five days to as long as six months after exposure. The infection can be treated with antibiotics, but those who are not treated can go on to develop more serious complications, such as arthritis, heart problems, enlargement of the spleen or liver, and, in rare cases, nervous system problems, like meningitis.\n\nIn pregnant women, a Brucella infection can lead to a miscarriage.\n\nAdvice to consumers\n\nThe CDC says people who have consumed raw milk from Miller's Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, Pennsylvania since January 2016 may have been exposed and should talk to their doctor.\n\nThose who are still within six months of exposure should receive antibiotics to prevent an infection and symptoms. They should continue to monitor their health for six months and if symptoms appear, seek medical treatment immediately.\n\nPeople who have consumed raw milk from the farm more than six months ago but who have had symptoms of brucellosis and have not been treated should see their doctor right away for testing to determine if they need treatment to avoid long-term health problems.\n\nFinally, consumers should throw away any raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ultraprocessed-foods-may-cut-your-life-short-study/", "text": "They may be tasty, but so-called ultraprocessed foods are not what the doctor ordered.

(\"Noncommunicable\" diseases are those that aren't infectious and can't be spread from person to person.)\n\nUltraprocessed\n\nAccording to the study, ultraprocessed foods are those that \"contain multiple ingredients and are manufactured through a multitude of industrial processes.\" Besides sugar, salt, fat and oil, these foods include additives such as flavors, colors, sweeteners and emulsifiers, Live Science reported in 2016. Examples of ultraprocessed items include packaged snacks; ice cream; candies; energy bars; processed meats; ready-made meals; and packaged cookies, cakes and pastries.\n\nPrevious studies have tied ultraprocessed food consumption to an increased risk of obesity, high blood pressure and cancer, but none have examined whether these foods were tied to a risk of early death.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers, from the University of Paris analyzed data from more than 44,000 adults age 45 and older living in France. Participants periodically completed questionnaires about the foods they'd eaten over the previous 24 hours and were followed for about 7 years. During the study period, about 600 participants died.\n\nOn average, about 30 percent of the participants' daily calories came from foods that were ultraprocessed.\n\nEach 10 percent increase in the proportion of ultraprocessed foods in the participants' diets was linked with a 14 percent higher risk of death over the 7-year study period.\n\nThe findings held even after the researchers took into account other factors that could affect a person's risk of death, such as income and education level, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking habits, total calorie intake, alcohol consumption, and a family history of cancer or heart disease.\n\nBehind the link\n\nUltraprocessed foods are known to have high levels of sodium and added sugar and low levels of fiber; these dietary components might in turn contribute to an increased risk of noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease and cancer, the authors said.\n\nIn addition, it's possible that chemicals added to or produced during the manufacturing process may have harmful effects, the researchers said. For example, some of the processes used to preserve meat may produce compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have been linked with developing cancer, Live Science reported. And some compounds used in the packaging or storage of processed foods, such as bisphenol A (BPA), may interfere with the activity of hormones in the body.\n\nStill, the researchers noted that the findings should be confirmed in other populations; additional studies are needed to understand how ultraprocessed foods may increase the risk of early death.\n\nOriginally published on Live Science."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/depression-during-and-after-pregnancy-can-be-prevented-panel-says/", "text": "Washington \u2014 Doctors already are supposed to screen new mothers for depression, to find those who need prompt care.

But the study also found that a few simple practices can help encourage healthier choices and reverse the trend of expanding waistlines.\n\n\"We know from weight tracking studies that many members of the public gain weight over Christmas that they often do not fully lose, which could adversely impact their health over time. We found that some simple strategies over this time of year prevented this from happening,\" study author Amanda Farley, PhD, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Applied Health Research, told CBS News.\n\nThese strategies boil down to two basic tips:\n\nStep on a scale to weigh yourself regularly\n\n\n\nAnd keep track of the amount of physical activity\n\n\n\nThe study, published in the Christmas issue of The BMJ medical journal, included 272 adults of varying weight. The participants were divided into two groups and followed for an average of 45 days around the holiday season in 2016 and 2017. Members of the first group, or the intervention group, were encouraged weigh themselves and reflect on their weight at least twice a week. They also received tips on managing their weight and a list of physical activity calorie equivalents of popular holiday foods and drinks.\n\nFor example, they were advised that one slice of a Christmas cake would require 18 minutes of running to burn off, while drinking a small glass of mulled wine requires 33 minutes of walking to expend the calories.\n\nUniversity of Birmingham\n\nThe second group \u2014 the control group \u2014 received a healthy living leaflet with no specific dietary advice.\n\nAt the end of the study period, the researchers found that those in the control group gained some weight over the holiday season while those who received more counseling about weighing themselves and burning off calories did not. After adjusting for other potential factors that could have an influence on weight, by the end of the study, weight was about 1 pound lower in the intervention group than the control group.\n\n\"Any amount of weight gain is associated with an increased risk to health,\" Farley said. \"The amount of weight gain prevented by this brief intervention might be considered relatively small, but these small weight gains, if not prevented over 10 years, would lead to more significant increases in weight, which is sufficient to drive the obesity epidemic.\"\n\nThe participants in the study were mostly women and mostly white, with an average age of 44.\n\nOther recent research has also found benefits to stepping on the scale for weight control. A study of more than 1,000 adults by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found those who weighed themselves several times a week had more significant weight loss in a year.

Players are set up to live with fellow gamers in shared homes where they practice constantly.\n\nSome teams have hired psychologists to help players avoid burnout. According to sports psychology consultant Doug Gardner, director of player performance for Immortals, he's seen players that looked exhausted and \"emaciated.\" \"They would come here and continue to play, and then it's like that definition of insanity,\" he said. \"Keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results.\"\n\nEsports players still in their teens can practice many hours a day and pride themselves on \"the grind.\" CBS News\n\nPlayers pride themselves in the long hours they put in. \"There's this badge of honor in esports, 'If I grind more, I am going to get better,'\" Gardner said.\n\nPhysical injuries are just as common, especially wrist injuries, which can derail careers. Players can develop carpal tunnel syndrome, where a pinched nerve in the wrist causes pain and numbness.\n\n\"If I play for too long, I'll get pain at the end of the day,\" professional player Indy Halpern tells his physical therapist, noting that \"too long\" is eight hours. During his last visit, he also mentioned lower back pain, and a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\nA rising star in the esports world, Halpern's fans know him by the name \"Space,\" his alias during competitions. Straight out of high school, Halpern was recruited to play Overwatch full-time for the Los Angeles Valiant. In addition to earning a salary, Halpern lives rent-free in an apartment paid for by his team, a perk of being a pro gamer.\n\nIndy Halpern gets physical therapy for wrist pain. \"If I play too long, I get pain at the end of the day,\" he said. CBS News\n\nCelebrity gamers can earn up to millions of dollars. While the grand prizes are big, players make an average salary of around $60,000. They often get housing subsidies, but the expectation is that they'll be practicing more or less around the clock. Halpern often shows up an hour or two before his teammates to practice.\n\nOverwatch isn't just a game anymore, it's his livelihood. \"It's a whole other level of stress,\" Halpern said. \"You're playing against professionals. It's always in the back of your mind. You always have that pressure on your shoulders that you have to perform.\"\n\nBelow the pro tournament level, there's a growing pipeline of young gamers developing their skills in school programs. There are over 100 high schools with North American Scholastic Esports Federation (NASEF) clubs for students. Schools in more than a dozen states plus Canada participate, with more clubs in California than anywhere else. A growing number of colleges have added varsity esports programs and some even offer scholarships for gamers.\n\n\"It'll be transformative and a way to engage students that right now education is missing out on,\" said NASEF Commissioner Mark Deppe.\n\n\"When I look at esports, I see it as uncharted territory and there is risk involved, he said. \"But that's when you find the reward as well.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-i-tried-and-failed-to-quit-google/", "text": "Google organizes nearly every aspect of my life. I've outsourced my memory to Google Search. Why remember things, when technology can sift and surface nuggets of information at precisely the right moment? Gmail helps me manage the unending stream of email messages and notifications. Google Calendar prepares me for every meeting, and Google Maps gets me to those meetings on time.\n\nBut I'm concerned about how the tech giant's broad reach and technological capability impacts my life. I'm also concerned about my reliance on the company's tools and services. Google's is so effective \u2014 and pervasive \u2014 that disconnecting from the company's services is a daunting process. I know, because last week I tried to quit Google entirely.\n\n\"Google provides internet users with the incredible convenience of logging in with a Gmail account across a plethora of non-Google web and mobile apps. For most consumers, that sounds great,\" said David Kohl, president and CEO of digital advertising marketplace TRUSTX. In exchange for our attention and our personal information, Google provides us with search, communication, and productivity applications. Many consumers and businesses find this to be a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nBut Kohl warns that Google's ability to harvest data from mobile phones and web browsers likely exceeds what most people expect. \"You're giving Google permission to track your online and mobile behaviors across more and more of your digital life.\"\n\nAccording to the company's privacy dashboard, I use 61 different Google services. Twelve of these services are critical to organizing my personal and professional life, including Search, Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Photos. I access these services using Google's browser Chrome, and my work cellphone runs on Google's mobile operating system Android.\n\nIt's very simple to delete your Google account by navigating to myaccount.google.com. But saving your data is a lot more complex. Because I rely on many Google services, extracting myself from the tech giant without losing everything was a multi-step, multi-day process. I used a to-do list application called Things to track my progress and make sure my data archive was complete.\n\nNext, I saved a copy of my data. (Never delete without a backup!) Fortunately, Google makes this a fairly painless process. I was able to use Takeout, the company's data download tool located at takeout.google.com, to create an archive of each service. I've been using a Google account since 2004, so my backup files were massive. Google informed me that each archive would take several days to generate.\n\nFinding alternatives to Google\n\nI had to find and install alternatives for all those Google products and services. Because I use so many, I spent hours researching software and applications.\n\nFastmail is a great replacement for Gmail. While the user interface is relatively unappealing, the technology is robust. To replace Google Drive and store files in the cloud, I opened a Dropbox account. I purchased a subscription to Ulysses , a charming and full-featured word-processing application to use instead of Google Docs. I'm a Mac user, so it was fairly simple to migrate my calendar to Fantastical , a great alternative to Apple's native calendar. There are dozens of scheduling apps for Android and Windows users.\n\nThe one Google product I found nearly impossible to replace was Search. Alternative search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo are fine, but these tools operate in a silo. Google search is spectacularly effective and deeply integrated across Google's applications, including Gmail and Google Docs. Without Google, it's no longer nearly as easy to search within my email or documents.\n\nFive days after initiating Google Takeout, my data was ready for download. I stored the 500-gigabyte file on a local hard drive, directed Firefox to my Google privacy dashboard, and deleted years of data. Over a hundred thousand email messages, documents, and events vanished instantly.\n\nI was free from Google. Kind of.\n\nGoogle's \"obsessive\" data collection doesn't stop\n\nDouglas C. Schmidt, a DARPA alum and professor of engineering at Vanderbilt University, warns that the company's advertising technology can still monitor my online activity. Even when you log out of Google services and use an alternative web browser, according to Schmidt's research the company might still be gathering data about your online behavior through its advertiser and publisher products.\n\n\"It would be almost impossible to overstate how obsessive Google's data collection is,\" Schmidt said. \"As long as you use [a phone] to browse the Web \u2014 even if you use no Google products or services \u2014 Google will be able to track your online activities.\"\n\nGoogle follows your activity, said Schmidt \"either via your Google ID or via your shadow profile,\" the advertising outline of your online behavior. \"In particular,\" said Schmidt, \"if a user decides to forgo the use of any Google product and visits only non-Google webpages, the number of times data is communicated to Google servers still remains surprisingly high. This communication is driven purely by advertiser/publisher services.\"\n\nAdditionally, both Chrome and Android send data back to Google over a dozen times per hour, and hundreds of times per day, said Schmidt, \"even in the absence of any user interaction.\" In fact, the research demonstrates that a dormant, stationary Android phone communicated location information to Google 340 times during a 24-hour period. Location information constituted 35 percent of all the mobile data samples sent to Google.\n\nGoogle also harvests data about you from retail transactions and \"third-party\" data brokers, according to Schmidt's research. Third-party data is information that's gathered about you by a company that might not have a direct relationship with you, like the credit monitoring services Experian and Acxiom. These data vendors build and sell lists of personal information about millions of individuals.\n\nAccording to Schmidt, in 2014 Google announced that it would acquire data from retail stores. This information included nearly 70 percent of all credit and debit transactions in the U.S., including the name of the individual, as well as the time, location, and amount of the purchase.\n\nWhen I told my family, friends, and colleagues I had deleted Google because I was uncomfortable with their data harvesting policies, most gave me a cockeyed look. Some expressed concern about how technology firms use our personal data, but couldn't understand why I would quit a service. \"I totally get why you're worried about big tech companies,\" said one close friend, \"but won't you feel lonely or kind of isolated without Google?\"\n\nI asked Jason Kint, CEO of the digital publishing association Digital Content Next, this same question. His answer surprised me. \"We need to push back hard on this outcome. Yes, it's nearly impossible to live your life without being on the internet. And the internet, including Google, has brought incredible good to the world. But if a cost to using the internet is allowing Google to be able to mine the details of your life that no one else in the world, not even your spouse, is privy to then we've allowed the original promise of it to be captured by Google's commercial interests.\"\n\nEpilogue: My experiment was successful for about two weeks. I was dispirited after learning from Dr. Schmidt that I'd be tracked even after deleting my data. And I was frustrated by the inefficiencies of alternative services. Google products are omnipresent. They're also very good. So I opened a fresh Google account, this time using G Suite, the company's paid productivity service. While I might still be tracked using G Suite, at least I can pay to not see ads."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-gave-tech-giants-more-access-to-users-data-than-it-said-new-york-times/", "text": "Facebook gave some of the tech industry's biggest companies greater access to users' personal data than the social-networking company previously disclosed, The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n\nSpecial arrangements detailed in internal Facebook documents gave Microsoft's Bing search engine access to the names of all Facebook users' friends without consent and allowed Netflix and Spotify to read Facebook users' private messages, the Times reported.\n\nOther arrangements allowed Amazon to obtain users' names and contact information through their friends and permitted Yahoo to view streams of friends' posts as recently as this summer, the Times reported, despite Facebook's statements that it had ended that type of data sharing.\n\nFacebook has been under scrutiny since the revelation in March that consultancy Cambridge Analytica had misused Facebook user data in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Since then, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has testified in front of Congress and the European Parliament to answer questions about Facebook's handling of user data.\n\nThe company has also been in the hot seat for not doing enough to prevent abuse from Russian trolls that posted misinformation and divisive content on the platform. The Russian activity was part of a coordinated campaign to interfere with the U.S. presidential election by sowing discord among voters.\n\nFacebook acknowledged in July it entered into data-sharing agreements with dozens of tech companies, admitting it continued sharing information with 61 hardware and software makers even after it said it had discontinued the practice in May 2015. The data-sharing agreements were intended to integrate the \"Facebook experience\" with mobile devices, something a Facebook representative at the time called a \"standard industry practice.\"\n\nThe Times reported Tuesday that the records show Facebook had arrangements with more than 150 companies -- mostly in the tech industry but also in the automotive and media industries -- to provide access to the data of hundreds of millions of people each month.\n\nThe deals were all active in 2017, and some were still in effect this year, the Times reported.\n\nFacebook denied allowing its partners to ignore people's privacy settings and said \"it's wrong to suggest that they do.\"\n\n\"Over the years, we've partnered with other companies so people can use Facebook on devices and platforms that we don't support ourselves,\" Steve Satterfield, Facebook's director of privacy and public policy, said in a statement. \"Unlike a game, streaming music service, or other third-party app, which offer experiences that are independent of Facebook, these partners can only offer specific Facebook features and are unable to use information for independent purposes.\"\n\nThe documents reviewed by the Times raise questions of whether Facebook's data-sharing agreements ran afoul of a consent decree issued by the Federal Trade Commission intended to monitor how Facebook tracks and shares data about its users.\n\nThe consent decree was borne out of a 2011 FTC complaint that accused Facebook of breaking its promise to keep its users' data private. Facebook had assured users that third-party applications only had access to data required for them to function. But in fact, applications had access to almost all of a user's personal information.\n\nUnder the settlement, Facebook agreed to get consent from users before sharing their data with third parties. It also required Facebook to establish a \"comprehensive privacy program\" and to have a third-party conduct audits every two years for the next 20 years to certify its program is effective.\n\nOther companies mentioned in the Times' report denied using their partnership with Facebook to violate users' privacy.\n\nAmazon said its partnership with Facebook didn't violate its own privacy policy.\n\n\"Amazon uses APIs provided by Facebook in order to enable Facebook experiences for our products,\" an Amazon spokesman said in a statement. \"For example, giving customers the option to sync Facebook contacts on an Amazon Tablet. We use information only in accordance with our privacy policy.\"\n\nMicrosoft said it took steps to ensure that Facebook data wasn't used to create profiles for advertising or personalization purposes.\n\n\"Throughout our engagement with Facebook, we respected all user preferences,\" a Microsoft spokesman said in a statement.\n\nNetflix said that while it tried to use Facebook to boost its usability among customers, it never read users' private messages on the social media site.\n\n\"Over the years we have tried various ways to make Netflix more social. One example of this was a feature we launched in 2014 that enabled members to recommend TV shows and movies to their Facebook friends via Messenger or Netflix,\" a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement. \"It was never that popular so we shut the feature down in 2015. At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook, or ask for the ability to do so.\"\n\nSpotify said in a statement: \"Spotify's integration with Facebook has always been about sharing and discovering music and podcasts. Spotify cannot read users' private Facebook inbox messages across any of our current integrations. Previously, when users shared music from Spotify, they could add on text that was visible to Spotify. This has since been discontinued. We have no evidence that Spotify ever accessed users' private Facebook messages.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNET"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/logoutfacebook-the-social-media-giant-faces-naacp-protests-and-canceled-accounts/", "text": "Facebook wants the world to be connected, but some individuals and groups say they're feeling a giant disconnect.\n\nPeople who have soured on the social media platform are either deleting or deactivating their accounts in the wake of numerous data breaches and privacy issues, which have caused critics to question whether they want to expose their personal information to the tech giant.\n\nOn Thursday, the NAACP organized a protest called #LogOutFacebook, which urges consumers to log out of their Facebook and Instagram accounts for the day, in the wake of the Senate report on Russian interference, which found the Russian government specifically targeted African-American communities on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nTo be sure, protests from disgruntled users aren't likely to make a dent in Facebook's massive size, which counted nearly 1.5 billion daily active users in September.

But you should also picture a reef-destroying lionfish, voracious Burmese python, or disease-spreading Asian tiger mosquito. As seasonal cycles shift and ecosystems are thrown off balance, those invasive species \u2014 and many others \u2014 could infiltrate a broader range of territories with devastating consequences to our health, vital habitats and industries.\n\nA species is considered invasive when it moves into an ecosystem that has not evolved to control it. Once a species gains a foothold in territory without its natural predators, it multiplies and eventually takes over. This is not a new phenomenon. According to the Convention on Biodiversity, 40 percent of all species that have gone extinct over the last 400 years have met that fate at least in part due to invasive species.\n\nHowever, climate change has already started to exacerbate the situation. A 2017 study found that at least a third of new introductions of invasive species in the last 200 years have occurred since 1970.\n\nIn the last three to five decades, the U.S. has suffered the impact of several invasive species. Burmese pythons have wreaked havoc in the Florida Everglades, reducing some native species by 99 percent since 1997.\n\nLionfish have invaded reefs in the Bahamas, wiping out up 95 percent of native marine life in some areas. The beautiful but destructive fish has also spread through the Gulf of Mexico and nearly the entire length of North America's Eastern Seaboard, the third largest reef system in the world.\n\nTwo lionfish are shown in an aquarium at the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center in Dania Beach, Florida, in 2013. The invasive species is considered menacing to native wildlife. Suzette Laboy / AP\n\nAsian carp, meanwhile, have effectively taken over the Mississippi River basin and are decimating local fishing industries. These insatiable giants were first imported in the 1970s to remove algae from ponds, but they were displaced by flooding and spilled out into the waterways, where they now crowd out favorites like catfish, shrimp and buffalo fish.\n\nRichard Durrett, a lifelong Louisiana-based commercial fisherman, says that for the last decade he's been struggling to stay afloat.\n\n\"I mean, when I was a younger guy we had probably 30, 32 local fishermen. We're down to seven now,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a big threat,\" said Philippe Parola, a local chef and businessman who took us out on the water. \"Not only here \u2014 we in Louisiana here \u2014 but they're all the way to Canada in the entire Mississippi basin. They multiply. They spawn like three million eggs per year.\"\n\nAnd because they didn't evolve here, there's no local predator to keep their numbers in check. Efforts to contain the problem include an underwater electric barrier built to keep them from entering the Great Lakes, where a $7 billion fishing industry is at risk.\n\nAsian carp have crowded out local species and made it hard for these Louisiana fishermen to earn a living. CBS News\n\nUntil now, many invasive species have been limited in their spread because of environmental factors like temperature and humidity. But the prospect of climate change threatens to open up new territory for foreign flora and fauna to take over.\n\nBurmese pythons, for example, have thrived and multiplied in South Florida, where conditions are somewhat similar to their native Southeast Asia. But in 2012, a Burmese python was spotted as far north as southern Georgia. Experts fear that climate change could eventually enable these enormous snakes to migrate even farther north.\n\nIt's not just large or exotic animals that people are concerned about. An invasive species can be any kind of living organism, including insects, plants, fungi, even microorganisms like bacteria \u2014 raising alarm about the increased possibility of global pandemics that could sicken millions of people or decimate wholesale food supplies like livestock and produce.\n\nInvasive plants alone already cost $30 billion per year in eradication efforts, a number that's likely to rise as climate conditions continue to shift. The growing season in the United States is already about two weeks longer than it was a century ago, allowing invasive plants to bloom earlier, sapping nutrients out of the soil and stealing an outsized share of the sunlight as they dwarf native species.\n\nWhile dealing with the impact of invasive species typically falls under the purview of local or regional authorities, combating climate change requires a worldwide effort. Virtually every nation in the world came together to sign the Paris climate agreement in 2015 aiming to curtail greenhouse gases and keep the average global temperature from climbing 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States was pulling out of the accord."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/burmese-python-invasive-species-in-florida-hurricane-andrew-legacy-cbsn-originals/", "text": "Watch the CBSN Originals documentary, \"Burmese Python Invasion: Fighting Invasive Species,\" in the video player above.\n\nIt's been 26 years since Hurricane Andrew became the costliest storm in Florida's history, but today residents of the Sunshine State are still paying the price in a way few would have imagined. Captive Burmese pythons let loose by Andrew's destruction have flourished in the southern Florida ecosystem, decimating local species in the process. And now there are signs this stubbornly invasive species may be poised to make its way beyond the state's borders.\n\nFlorida's current python problem had its genesis about a decade before Andrew hit. Pet owners and exotic animals exhibitors in the U.S. had started importing the Southeast Asian Burmese python \u2014 among the top 5 largest snake species \u2014 for their size and novelty in this part of the world. However, caring for what can grow to be a 15- to 20-foot-long, 200-pound predator can become overwhelming and dangerous. Floridians who found themselves incapable of caring for their pythons relieved themselves of that burden by releasing the snakes into Florida's Everglades, the largest wilderness area in the eastern U.S.\n\nAt 734 square miles, Everglades National Park is almost two-thirds the size of Rhode Island and filled with an abundance of wildlife. According to the National Park Service, it's the most significant breeding ground for wading birds in North America. The Burmese python was first sighted in the Everglades in the 1980's, but that turned out to be the calm before the storm.\n\nOn August 23, 1992 Andrew made landfall south of Miami as a Category 5 hurricane, one of the most powerful ever to hit the United States. Sustained winds whipped at upwards of 150 miles per hour, more than enough to rip roofs off homes and demolish buildings, including a number of exotic wildlife facilities in the area. One of the buildings affected was a breeding facility for Burmese pythons, and many of them escaped.\n\n\"Thousands of specimens of exotics [sic] species escaped their caging and enclosures during the passing of the storm through south Dade County,\" state environmental inspectors reported 10 days after the hurricane. \"Witnesses spotted hundreds of large snakes and non-venomous snakes loose.\"\n\nA Burmese python captured in Davie, Florida, in 2013. Getty\n\nToday the Everglades are overrun with the giant snakes and it's had devastating consequences. A 2012 study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that after Andrew exacerbated the Burmese python invasion of the Florida Everglades, populations of raccoons and opossums dropped roughly 99 percent and some species of rabbits and foxes effectively disappeared. Species that had long flourished here were being decimated by the aggressive newcomers.\n\nInvasive species are often able to thrive because they lack natural predators in their new environments, and these snakes are no exception. According to Donna Kalil, a state-sanctioned python hunter in the Everglades area, by the time they reach just 2 years old, the only species that can threaten pythons in the Everglades are alligators.\n\n\"At this size, it can definitely take your cat and dog,\" Kalil said of one specimen she caught. Full grown, a Burmese python could swallow a deer or even a human being, whole.\n\n\"There's not many things that a snake is going to think about. They're going to say, 'Predator or prey?' Or, 'Can I eat you or are you going to eat me?',\" Kalil said.\n\nFlorida's government has stepped in to try to control the burgeoning python population. In addition to contracting hunters like Kalil, they've allowed open season on the snakes all year long. Residents are authorized to catch and kill Burmese pythons by almost any means necessary, with no permit required, especially on private lands.\n\nIt's had some impact. As of May 2018, 1,000 Burmese pythons had been captured in Florida since the problem began.\n\nHowever, the python population has grown far faster than hunters can catch them. The snakes inhabit a vast area and reproduce rapidly. One female can lay up to 100 eggs a year and has a lifespan upwards of 15 years. Estimates of how many Burmese pythons now inhabit the Everglades range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.\n\nWith their numbers growing and their food supply dwindling, the pythons are expanding their territory. In November 2012, a Burmese python was spotted as far north as southern Georgia. The species' spread is limited by temperature and other environmental conditions it needs to survive, but experts fear that climate change will eventually enable the snakes to migrate even farther north.\n\nExperts say once an invasive species gains a foothold in an ecosystem, it's there to stay, often with devastating consequences. As Florida's Burmese pythons multiply and expand their territory, they seem destined to become Hurricane Andrew's most lasting \u2014 and unwelcome \u2014 legacy."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-virtual-money-real-power-cbsn-originals/", "text": "Driving into the small town of Wenatchee, Washington, about three hours east of Seattle, a sign welcomes you to the \"Apple Capital of the World.\" But not far from the abundant orchards, a very different industry is taking root. As unlikely as it may seem, this rural community has become a hub for cryptocurrency mining.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency justified the expense to build something that no one would otherwise build,\" said entrepreneur David Carlson, as rows upon rows of computer servers whirred away at the facility he set up here. \"These things can run 24/7 making cryptocurrency.\"\n\nHe has big plans for his business, even if some Wenatchee residents don't like it.\n\n\"We want to grow ten times larger than we are now, and we can do it here, or we can do it somewhere, but we're going to do it,\" Carlson said.\n\nBitcoin is the best known, but it's just one of many digital forms of currency. These cryptocurrencies are decentralized; rather than being processed through banks, transactions are verified and recorded by individual users. Encrypted technology called blockchain keeps the transactions secure.\n\nBitcoin hit a high of over $19,700 in December 2017, though it's worth much less, about $6,300, today. Despite the volatility, rising values have fueled a whole new industry and legions of enthusiasts. At a recent cryptocurrency conference in Atlantic City, thousands gathered to explore new ideas and opportunities in the field.\n\n\"So I live off of bitcoin,\" said Kenn Bosak, who hosts \"Pure Blockchain Wealth\" on YouTube. \"It pays my rent. I book my flights with cheapair.com. They accept bitcoin, Dash, all kinds of cryptocurrencies. I book my rooms with BitPay with my Visa card. My Lyft drivers accepts BitPay, that's bitcoin. So I'm all in. I use bitcoin in every aspect of my life.\"\n\nUnlike dollars or other conventional currencies, cryptocurrency like bitcoin isn't issued by a government. It's created through a process called mining, which is leading to a virtual gold rush around the world.\n\nHow does mining work?\n\nEvery time someone uses cryptocurrency to pay for something, it sets off a flurry of invisible activity. Computer servers, which can be located anywhere in the world, work to verify and process the transaction, racing to authenticate the exchange of digital money through complex transactions.\n\nFor doing this work, the machines (and their owners) are rewarded with new cryptocurrency. With a sufficient number of powerful computers, it can be a lucrative business.\n\nThat's what David Carlson's company, Giga Watt, is busy doing at his facility in Wenatchee. He started with just a few small machines, but with the help of investors, he's scaled up significantly. Now his rooms full of computer servers work feverishly to mine cryptocurrency around the clock.\n\nDavid Carlson shows CBS News' Errol Barnett his cryptocurrency mining operation in Wenatchee, Washington. CBS News\n\nEach of the small machines makes roughly $1,500 worth of bitcoin every year, though the amount of profit fluctuates every day. As Carlson showed CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett around, the site hummed with the sound of giant industrial cooling fans.\n\n\"Every one of these things is like a thousand-watt hair dryer. So there will be a thousand of those hairdryers in this spot. So that's quite a lot of heat. Don't try it at home,\" Carlson said.\n\n\"This entire wall is the future, according to you,\" Barnett said.\n\n\"Yeah. The future of money right here,\" Carlson replied.\n\nHe plans to have 22 of his pods completed by the end of the year \u2014 and all that computer power sucks up a huge amount of electricity.\n\n\"Our pods use one and a half megawatts, which is typically associated with, like, 600 homes,\" he said.\n\nPowering his operation would cost a fortune most places, but Wenatchee has a competitive advantage: the Columbia River. Dams on the river generate cheap hydroelectric power, which has drawn crypto mining enthusiasts to this corner of the country.\n\nSteve Wright, the general manager of the Chelan County public utility, says it has long been an economic engine for the region. \"What we have seen more recently are industries like cryptocurrency that have come to the region for the same reasons that aluminum came here. Low-cost, reliable electricity,\" he said.\n\nDams on the Columbia River provide cheap power to the Pacific Northwest. CBS News\n\nBut even here, there are limits.\n\n\"We have requests for service that would double the usage here in the county, and we're trying to figure out, you know, how are we going to deal with that, and what the implications would be for the people who live here,\" Wright said.\n\nThe race for cheap power\n\nBecause access to cheap power is key, crypto miners are racing to set up shop anywhere in the world they can find low rates. Cold climates are also preferred, to help reduce cooling costs.\n\nBut this tech boom is not without problems. Among the issues: the droning noise of all that equipment. The hum reverberates far beyond the walls. And some of the operations have sprung up in a decidedly makeshift fashion.\n\n\"Would you want to live next to one of these?\" said Andrew Wendell, customer service director for the utility. \"Not just the aesthetics, but also the noise. There's a lot of noise. They really do belong in an industrial setting.\"\n\nHe continues, \"And it gives us a bit of a concern, because, quite literally, you could have a tractor trailer come in and load this thing up and move it out, literally overnight. And so it just begs the question, from a utility who is providing and building the infrastructure to support these, how long is our investment? When we build those, we are building for 40, 50, 60 years. This doesn't look like that long term.\"\n\nNot only is he worried about miners abandoning Wenatchee and leaving behind expensive new power connections \u2014 there are also safety concerns. Some mining setups push the infrastructure to the breaking point.\n\nIndustrial fans are needed to cool the rows of supercomputers that mine for cryptocurrency. CBS News\n\nWendell shows us an example. \"What we have here is a standard residential home, but this shed, about 10 by 10 here, off to the side with the fence, that's full of cryptocurrency mining operations.\"\n\nHe holds up the remnants of a frayed and melted underground electrical cable.\n\n\"This plastic insulation breaks down because there's so much heat?\" Barnett asks.\n\n\"There's so much heat. It can't dissipate the heat. So the insulation breaks down, and then the cables go phase to phase. And when they go phase to phase, they combust. They arc and they can start a fire. And that's what happened [here], is a fire started,\" Wendell said. \"The bottom line is, is that when you mix the cryptocurrency mining with traditional residential load, if you don't have things built and designed appropriately, you're going to have some problems.\"\n\nHe adds, \"In this part of the country, a wildfire can spread and burn literally hundreds of homes. So we take that very seriously.\"\n\nWhile some in Wenatchee are excited about the economic potential of cryptocurrency mining, many others are concerned about its massive power consumption and other risks.\n\n\"Nobody wants a fire, you know, like their apartment complex burning down, because someone is mining bitcoin,\" one resident said.\n\nSome admit they don't fully understand it. \"It's just going to drain our power, and that's really all I know,\" a local woman told us.\n\nFacing overwhelming demand for power from cryptocurrency miners and increasing concern from the community, the utility placed a moratorium on new mining requests until they could agree on a solution. Local miners were not happy.\n\n\"They went overboard with their moratorium. It was kinda crazy for 'em to say, 'No, you can't do that. We're \u2013 we're shutting everything down in the \u2013 in the entire county,'\" said Matt McColm. He was planning to set up a mining operation in his insurance office to generate some extra money for his 12-year-old son's college fund. He'd already ordered the equipment on Amazon. But now he'll have to move it all to a site a few hours away in Oregon instead.\n\n\"What you've got is \u2013 is you've got is several large players that kind of salted the earth for everyone else. They're literally consuming large sections of our town and edging out the small ones,\" McColm said. \"It's kinda rough, because I'd rather develop here locally... and put the money here in Wenatchee.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the utility held a public hearing for input on the moratorium and the future of cryptocurrency mining in Wenatchee.\n\nSome locals stood up to voice complaints about what the industry is doing to their town. \"I read a lot about what bitcoin operators want, and what bitcoin is doing for them. I'm not hearing that it's doing anything much for us. This is a take, take, take, not a give,\" one woman said.\n\nOthers made the case to encourage business development, like the man who said, \"I'd ask you guys to consider the very small operations that are existing right here in town. A large rate increase would drastically affect our business, putting some of us out.\"\n\nCrypto mining is just the beginning\n\nMuch of the concern about cryptocurrency mining is its volatility. With prices soaring one day and crashing the next, many worry the entire market could collapse. But advocates say they are missing the big picture \u2014 a growing industry that's about more than just mining.\n\nMalachi Salcido, another large-scale miner, says the rise of supercomputing, using specialized hardware and cheap power, can also enable things like artificial intelligence.\n\n\"And so it helps you to understand why in the world would you build a 30, 40-year asset for something that's only nine years old? I didn't. I built it for a new technology that will have many current and future iterations that we don't yet fully understand,\" he said.\n\nHe believes his investment will pay off, even if cryptocurrency fizzles.\n\n\"The demand internationally for power and networking for computing space is rising so rapidly that I'm very comfortable there will be demand for our location, even if crypto doesn't become the market it could.\"\n\nSalcido, a Wenatchee native, wants to see his hometown benefit from the new industry. But for now, he must expand elsewhere.\n\n\"Our strategic goal is 500 megawatts within the next 5 years, and 5 to 10 percent of the global network. We are currently negotiating developments in northern Idaho, northern Oregon, and northern central California. Our choice is whether or not they happen here,\" he said.\n\nA moratorium may stem the flood of miners arriving in Wenatchee, but it won't stop them from seeking out cheap power wherever they can find it.\n\nIn June, a cryptocurrency mining company called Coinmint took over a massive former Alcoa aluminum plant near the small town of Massena, in upstate New York. Coinmint is investing $700 million to turn it into a bitcoin mining behemoth. Once complete, it could be the largest in the world.\n\nAerial view of a former Alcoa aluminum plant near Massena, in update New York, which is being turned into a massive bitcoin mining facility. CBS News\n\nBack in Wenatchee, the only question for Dave Carlson is not whether to grow, but where.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency justified the expense to build something that no one would otherwise build,\" he said. \"Supercomputing, A.I. can be the new export.\"\n\n\"So you're confident that you will grow, you're just concerned that it will be elsewhere because Wenatchee blinked at a critical moment?\" Barnett asked.\n\nCarlson agreed. \"That's exactly right.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adapt-or-die-cbsn-originals/", "text": "Across the planet, animal and plant species are on the run. A rapidly changing climate is shifting when and where plants blossom, and forcing creatures big and small to migrate and learn new tactics for survival.\n\nIt's a trend that's likely to accelerate as scientists expect to see more extreme weather events -- intensifying storms and droughts, and greater temperature fluctuations on land and sea. To understand the impact, researchers are flocking to a unique, living lab: the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\n\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos, a remote, rocky archipelago 500 miles off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean, are home to animals that don't exist anywhere else in the world -- animals so unique that they inspired Charles Darwin to formulate the theory of evolution after his famous voyage aboard the H.M.S. Beagle in the 1830s.\n\nSpecies like giant tortoises, marine iguanas, flightless cormorants and finches with finely-tuned beaks evolved in isolation here over millions of years -- since long before humans walked the Earth. But today, those that fail to adapt to their changing environment within the space of a few brief generations may face the prospect of extinction.\n\nAn iguana perches on the Gal\u00e1pagos' rocky coast. CBS News\n\nCBSN Originals traveled to the Gal\u00e1pagos to see firsthand how the effects of both climate change and adaptation are playing out right now.\n\nThe coral detective\n\nMarine biologist Jon Witman from Brown University comes to the Gal\u00e1pagos regularly to monitor the effects of climate change on the evolutionary process.\n\n\"It's been stated that the Gal\u00e1pagos is the natural laboratory for evolution. And we're saying that it's a natural laboratory for studying climate change and evolutionary responses to climate change,\" Witman told CBS News' Adam Yamaguchi.\n\nHe said evolutionary changes that once unfolded over hundreds of thousands of years are now happening before our eyes.\n\n\"It's a major new perspective in evolutionary biology and ecology, because it's forcing ecologists like me to think about adaptation and natural selection on the period of ten years or so,\" he said.\n\nWitman's team is focused on understanding the impact underwater, diving to inspect the health of coral reefs and see how changes in water temperature may be shaping changes in marine species.\n\nPart of what they're looking for is the impact of repeated El Ni\u00f1o systems, which he calls \"the greatest modulator of climate on the planet.\" El Ni\u00f1o is a complex weather phenomenon that results in a warming of Pacific Ocean waters, which can devastate marine populations. Its counterpart, La Ni\u00f1a, cools the water and helps foster growth and recovery in the ecosystem.\n\nThese warming and cooling cycles test the resilience of species to withstand opposite extremes.\n\nCoral will bleach and eventually die if the water becomes too warm or too cold. And since 90 percent of marine species -- from algae all the way up the food chain -- rely on the habitat of coral reefs, the consequences are far-reaching.\n\nWitman is concerned about evidence that climate change may make the naturally-occurring El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a cycles more frequent and more extreme -- pushing nature's resilience to a breaking point. Will animals be able to cope?\n\n\"That's the $64 million question that we want to answer,\" he said. \"Yes and no. I think the no part is that the El Ni\u00f1o stress may recur so frequently that the species that are stressed don't have enough time to recover before the next El Ni\u00f1o comes.\n\n\"There's no doubt we are in an unprecedented period of global stress in terms of climate impacts. And basically the natural world is being hit by what I call the big three. Certainly climate change is up there. Habitat destruction by humans is absolutely key. And we're also adding pollution to the ecosystem. It sounds pretty grim, and it is grim.\"\n\nThe penguin wrangler\n\nThere are fewer than 1,000 Gal\u00e1pagos penguins on the islands, and Gustavo Jimenez is on a mission to capture every last one of them. The researcher and his team work day and night to chase down and scoop up the birds so that they can be measured and studied, then released back into the wild.\n\n\"We're worried what happening in the planet. The planet is just -- is one, just one house for everybody, for every species. So we know we need to protect them,\" Jimenez said.\n\nHe's tracking the health of the penguins and whether they're having babies. The data he gathers on this endangered species will be critical to understanding how the changing climate may affect their feeding and breeding patterns -- and may help find clues to evolutionary changes the species is undergoing.\n\nTheir survival is not assured. The planet is currently experiencing one of the greatest extinction events since the dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago. While extinction is a natural phenomenon, with one to five species historically being lost each year, these days it's occurring at 1,000 to 10,000 times the natural rate. Dozens of species worldwide are being lost forever every single day.\n\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are home to many unique bird species. CBS News\n\nIt's a threat potentially facing the flightless cormorant, a bird Yamaguchi calls an \"oddity of evolution.\" Somewhere around two million years ago, its evolutionary path diverged from other cormorants and it lost the ability to fly. The Gal\u00e1pagos cormorants didn't need to fly; they could find all the food they needed in the waters off the islands' jagged rocks, so they developed powerful legs and webbed feet to help them become strong swimmers instead.\n\nPenguins share those rocks, nesting in pairs in the cave-like crevices. Jimenez said climate change is having a noticeable impact on them, forcing penguins to move their nests to higher ground. The researchers keep a record of each location.\n\nThe penguins' ability to adapt -- which helped this species thrive near the equator while most penguins chill in Antarctica -- offers their best hope for the future. But this time around, they may not have millions of years to figure it out.\n\n\"Maybe the time is smaller than before, and the problem is how they could adapt \u2026 in that short time,\" Jimenez said.\n\nDarwin's finches today\n\nResearcher Jaime Chaves is a self-described \"bird geek\" who's taken an interest in studying Darwin's finches -- the very species that helped inspire Charles Darwin's landmark book, \"The Origin of Species,\" in 1859.\n\nDarwin documented how the beaks of these small birds varied from island to island to take advantage of available food sources. Those with sharp beaks feasted on insects while others with short, stout beaks plucked seeds from the ground. Natural selection meant those best suited to their environments thrived and multiplied, while others struggled and died out. Eventually they developed into 14 distinct species.\n\nChaves and his team string up very fine netting between the trees to capture finches for study.\n\n\"We're gonna analyze and collect the data on their morphology, that is, how different their beaks are,\" he explained. \"The beak shape is one of those traits in birds that is so key because it will determine the fate of that group.\"\n\nChaves and his students track minute changes, year to year, in the shapes and sizes of the finches' beaks as the flocks adapt to the varieties of food available. Those with inadequate beaks don't survive. And because the finches breed two or three generations every year, \"in so little time, you can see evolution in action,\" he said.\n\nThese rapid adaptations may give it an advantage for survival in a changing world. In 2017, researchers discovered that an entirely new species had been formed when a wayward bird mated with another finch species and produced offspring. Chaves expects to see more of that happening globally as various species migrate.\n\nBut it won't always work. \"Many species will not be able to make it,\" he said, echoing the concerns Jimenez expressed for the penguins and Witman for the coral ecosystem. \"For many species in which you have this limitation of time, you might be too late.\"\n\nIt may be the ultimate test of the survival of the fittest, and many species -- even our own -- could lose out.\n\n\"I think the issue right now that we have is that the changes are happening in such a short period of time. The same amount of change that you've seen happening in a couple of millions of years has happened in the last 40 years,\" Chaves said. \"From our perspective of humans, we have understand that it's our responsibility that these changes are happening because [of] our own mishandling of the planet.\"\n\nIt's no longer enough for animals to evolve. They have to adapt now, adapt fast -- or die."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-killer-whales-researchers-technology-drones-antarctic-ocean/", "text": "In this latest installment of the \u201cClimate Diaries\u201d series, CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips is in Antarctica, following a group of researchers chasing killer whales.

This hunt, though, isn\u2019t about killing whales; it\u2019s about saving them. It\u2019s about giving them a health check, and the prognosis isn\u2019t particularly good.\n\nCBS News\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we study top predators -- and killer whales are the top predator in the ocean -- is to understand the health of the ecosystem that supports them,\u201d said John Durban. He and Holly Fearnbach are modern whale hunters who use the latest tools.\n\n\n\nThey use a drone fitted with equipment to monitor the whales\u2019 condition.\n\n\u201cWith a small drone like this, we can fly just a little over 100 feet -- the whales don\u2019t know it\u2019s there -- and we fly a camera much lower so the quality of the images are so much better,\u201d Durban explained.\n\nCBS News\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results are better pictures, but, it turns out, not better whales.\n\n\n\nThe images of one pod of killer whales were not encouraging, particularly for the adult female -- the mother of the family.\n\nResearch under NMFS\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Phillips asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very, very thin,\u201d Fearnbach said.\n\nResearch under NMFS\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou could see just following her, her whole body profile, you could see her ribs really clearly, so she\u2019s lost all of the fat along her entire body,\u201d Fearnbach said.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a dying whale here?\u201d Phillips asked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re looking at a dying whale.

You wouldn\u2019t think you could take health-analyzing samples from whales out here in the Antarctic Ocean, but you can.

So these collection plates, like the one on the top here and the front here, they\u2019re sterile, and we\u2019re able to collect droplets of whale blow. And from that, we take them back to the lab and use genetic techniques to identify the microorganisms that are in that blow,\u201d Durban explained.\n\nIt\u2019s early in the program and Durban and Fearnbach are just building up a database of what comes out of a whale\u2019s blowhole. But if a whale is unwell, the theory is you\u2019d effectively be able to smell it on their breath.\n\nIn the meantime, they can only take an educated guess on why they\u2019re finding sick whales in these pristine waters, which, like everywhere else, are getting warmer. The pack ice around which they normally hunt is not as abundant as it used to be; neither is the food they hunt for.\n\n\u201cOur hypothesis certainly is there\u2019s\u2026 you know, a problem with their food supply, and\u2026 fewer seals. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing so far this year,\u201d Durban said.\n\n\u201cLess ice, fewer seals? Is that a leap?\u201d Phillips asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a hypothesis,\u201d Durban said.\n\nThe next time Durban and Fearnbach are down this way, they\u2019ll be looking for this family of whales, hoping they\u2019re still around.\n\n\n\nBecause this place is so remote and so difficult to work in for much of the year, wildlife research is less developed than in the Arctic.

It's complicated, so here's a breakdown.\n\nWhy are Facebook and Cambridge Analytica in the news?\n\nIn a nutshell, because the personal data of 50 million people was pulled from Facebook by a company contracted by Cambridge Analytica and used for ... we're not sure exactly what. (Facebook later said the number may have been even higher: up to 87 million users.) The third-party firm, Global Science Research, used a clicky personality quiz to get people to interact with the app, which then used a loophole to pull all the behind-the-scenes data of that user, and also the same data relating to all their friends -- typically 200-300 other people per user.\n\nFacebook issued a press release Friday, March 9, saying they had banned Cambridge Analytica, Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie from its platform because they had improperly shared and failed to delete that data, but that seems to have been a pre-emptive move. Late that day, The Guardian published a detailed interview with whistleblower Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica staffer, who was involved in building its data operations to scrape user data from Facebook.\n\nCambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie opens up\n\nThe Guardian claims Facebook threatened to sue to keep the story under wraps, while Cambridge Analytica said it was working within the terms and conditions of Facebook's platform, and that the third party was to blame for any breach of trust or privacy.\n\nOn Monday, March 12, Channel 4 News, a U.K. outlet, published a video in which they went undercover, posing as a prospective client of Cambridge Analytica, who pitched its election-influencing capacity to Channel 4, complete with bribery stings, social media manipulation and truth-bending propaganda.\n\nWhat to know about Cambridge Analytica\n\nWho's the bad guy in all this?\n\nDepends on your point of view. Cambridge Analytica, through a third party contractor, definitely made the most of the tools available to them to mine Facebook for every ounce of data it could reach without breaking the law, and may have used that data beyond the scope of what was permissible.\n\nGlobal Science Research, that third party, were the ones who crafted the personality quiz for maximum efficacy, and actually did the data extraction.\n\nBut the spotlight is certainly on Facebook for permitting that loophole to exist in the first place, for failing to protect its users' personal data, and for not acting, nor being transparent about it when they knew there had been problems. They knew in 2015 -- Friday's statement was their first acknowledgement there was a problem, more than two years later.\n\nWho is Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie?\n\nWho is Christopher Wylie?\n\nChristopher Wylie is the whistleblower, an early employee of Cambridge Analytica who detailed their data-scraping techniques in a bombshell interview with The Guardian from his experience putting it into practice. Wylie was one of the actors banned from the platform by Facebook, something he says is regrettable.\n\n\"They seem really pissed off,\" Wylie told CBS News on Monday. \"I don't think they've handled it well -- they haven't done anything on this for two years, And now they have banned me.\"\n\nWylie said that he was seeking to cooperate with Facebook ahead of the article going live. \"We were going to work on this in a cooperative manner -- there's obviously a lot of issues that need to be discussed -- but you know, I didn't set out to crusade against Facebook -- suddenly they issue this press release and ban me.\"\n\nWas this a data breach?\n\nNot in the classic, sense, no, in that the data wasn't stolen in a hack. Nobody broke into somebody's account and pilfered data. But that's what makes it so worrying -- they didn't have to. Facebook, through its app protocols at the time, allowed an organization to rifle through users' accounts willy-nilly and take their personal data without any real informed consent.\n\nFacebook executives earned widespread internet scorn for trying to defend the company on that technicality. Sure, it may be correct to say it wasn't a breach, by dictionary definition, but for more than 50 million end users, the net effect was the same. Their data was taken without their knowledge, potentially to be used against them.\n\nLawmakers demand answers from Facebook over Cambridge Analytica\n\nShould I be worried?\n\nThat depends on your point of view. Facebook says it's working to ensure that all the data extracted is no longer in circulation,or stored anywhere that could be hacked. But what's more important is to stay informed on what the apps you use do with your data. Facebook profiles its users, their likes and interests in minute detail to help advertisers and other groups -- like political action groups -- reach them and convince them to vote, buy things and take certain actions. If that seems concerning to you, learn about your security settings and consider limiting your use of platforms that allow more access to your information than you're happy with.\n\nHere are some things you can do, per TechRepublic's Dan Patterson, to keep your data secure:\n\nEnable two-factor authentication on all of your accounts.\n\n\n\nDon't click links in your email and instead copy/paste URLs.\n\n\n\nCheck your email header to make sure inbound email is from known URLs.\n\n\n\nBeware of phishing attacks that look legit.\n\n\n\nDon't enter your username and password anywhere.\n\n"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/check-my-facebook-data-shared-how-to-breach-notification-april-2018/", "text": "NEW YORK -- For millions of Facebook users concerned about whether their personal data was swept up in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook is finally releasing tools to help you find out. Facebook says most of the affected users -- more than 70 million of the estimated 87 million total -- are in the U.S., though there are over a million each in the Philippines, Indonesia and the U.K.\n\nThere are two ways to find out whether your data was shared without your knowledge: through an alert that Facebook says it will post in your News Feed, or by checking yourself through Facebook's online Help Center.\n\nWas your personal information taken? Check with this link\n\nAs is usually the case with all things Facebook, the alert is slowly being rolled out to impacted users, CNET reports. Instead of refreshing your News Feed countless times to see if the alert is going to appear, Facebook has also set up a page in its Help Center where you can go and check.\n\nVisit this Facebook support page and log into your account. Look for the Was My Information Shared? section, and it will tell you whether you or any of your friends used the now-banned quiz app called \"This Is Your Digital Life,\" which scraped friends' personal information and then passed it to Cambridge Analytica, a data consulting firm linked to the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nCheck Facebook's online Help Center to find out if your data was shared with Cambridge Analytica.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that he made a \"huge mistake\" in failing to take a broad enough view of what Facebook's responsibility is in the world. He's testifying about it before Congress Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nIn his prepared testimony, Zuckerberg referred to Facebook as \"an idealistic and optimistic company\" that \"didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.\"\n\n\"We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here,\" his statement said.\n\nFacebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, mainly echoed Zuckerberg's remarks in a round of interviews last week.\n\n\"This was a huge breach of trust,\" Sandberg said on CNBC. \"People come to Facebook every day and they depend upon us to protect our data and I am so sorry that we let so many people down.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie previously estimated that more than 50 million people were compromised by a personality quiz that collected data from users and their friends. Facebook later put the figure at up to 87 million. In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Wylie said the true number could be even larger than 87 million.\n\nThat Facebook app, called \"This is Your Digital Life,\" was a personality quiz created in 2014 by an academic researcher named Aleksander Kogan, who paid about 270,000 people to take it. The app vacuumed up not just the data of the people who took it, but also -- thanks to Facebook's loose restrictions at the time -- data from their friends, too, including details that they hadn't intended to share publicly.\n\nFacebook later limited the data apps can access, but it was too late in this case.\n\nZuckerberg said Facebook came up with the 87 million figure by calculating the maximum number of friends that users could have had while Kogan's app was collecting data. The company doesn't have logs going back that far, he said, so it can't know exactly how many people may have been affected.\n\nCambridge Analytica said in a statement Wednesday that it had data for only 30 million Facebook users."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/robots-replacing-humans-cbsn-originals/", "text": "\"Anything you can do I can do better. And faster and cheaper.\" It's an enticing promise from a TV news announcer named Erica -- who happens to be a robot.\n\nShe's emblematic of a new generation of robotic technology that's being developed to supplement, or in some cases replace, the work of humans. Unlike the industrial robots that took over factory jobs in decades past, these robots have a more human touch and can interact with people in ways previously imagined only in science fiction.\n\nCBS News' Adam Yamaguchi traveled to Japan to see why that country is on the leading edge of robot development.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that Japan is a strange, exotic and quirky place, where you see things you won't encounter anywhere else,\" he says.\n\nBut that's not the only reason robots are big here. It also has a lot to do with an aging and declining population.\n\nJapan's population of 120 million is the oldest in the world. Nearly 34 percent of the population is over 60 years old, and by mid-century, the number is expected to jump to over 42 percent of the population.\n\nAt the same time, younger people are having fewer children or none at all. Some leaders and academics express alarm at a growing number of young men who've reported little or no interest in sex. According to recent studies, nearly one-third of Japanese men entering their 30s are still virgins.\n\nSome studies project that in 50 years, Japan's population will be down to half of its current numbers, a trend unprecedented in modern history. The government is attempting to increase birth rates with financial incentives, and it's opening up to migrant labor in ways the insular island nation has traditionally resisted. But technology is also part of the solution.\n\nWhile human birthrates have stagnated, robot reproduction is rapidly increasing. Already home to the biggest robot population in the world -- over 340,000 -- future projections are staggering: by 2025, Japan will be home to over 3 million robots.\n\nAlready, they are being incorporated into everyday life in ways you might not expect.\n\nRobots at your service\n\nIn a country with a shrinking workforce, service jobs like hotel clerks and cleaning staff are ripe for a robot revolution.\n\nAt the Henna Hotel -- which translates as the \"weird\" hotel -- a friendly-looking female robot and, oddly, a talking dinosaur staff the front desk. Automated window-washers and vacuum cleaners keep the place spotless. Robots do everything from landscaping to carrying luggage to mixing drinks.\n\nA robotic dinosaur mans the front desk at a fully-automated hotel. CBS News\n\n\"During my stay, I didn't see a single person working here because everything is automated,\" Yamaguchi observed.\n\nAid for aging workers\n\nSometimes instead of replacing humans, robots help them keep working. At a logistics facility in Osaka, a 57-year-old employee dons a robotic exoskeleton to help him meet the physical demands of the job: lifting and hauling heavy loads that look like they would wear out a man half his age.\n\n\"When I didn't have this exoskeleton suit I used to have back pain and there was so much pressure on my legs,\" he said. \"It was very difficult to do my job. But now with this technology, I hardly have any back pain anymore. I only need to exert half as much strength to do the job now.\"\n\nA robotic exoskeleton helps this worker lift heavier loads with less effort. CBS News\n\nHe had been on track to retire at age 60, but with the help of the exoskeleton he figures he can stay in the workforce until he's 65 or even older.\n\nCompanionship and care\n\nFor the elderly beyond their working years, another need arises. There aren't enough workers to meet the demands of the skyrocketing number of elderly people needing care and companionship.\n\nThat's where Paro comes in. Paro is a cute but highly sophisticated robot that's become a familiar face in nursing homes across the country. Paro looks like an adorable baby seal and reacts to sound and touch just like a living, breathing pet -- eliciting emotional responses from their elderly friends. Residents know it's a robot but make a deep connection just the same.\n\nParo engages residents at a nursing home. CBS News\n\nParo's creator says the interaction has been shown to improve levels of pain, anxiety and depression and reduce stress compared with other groups without the cuddly robot.\n\nSocial robots\n\nPepper, the world's first commercially available social robot, comes with a cool $20,000 price tag. Tomomi Ota, 31, one of the early adopters, seems to think it's worth the price.\n\n\"I've been living with Pepper for two years so it's really normal that Pepper is here with me. In fact, if Pepper is not here I'll ask, 'Where is Pepper today?' It's so natural that Pepper is by my side,\" she said.\n\nShe takes Pepper out for walks and sits the robot down for meals with the family.\n\nTomomi Ota takes Pepper out for a stroll. CBS News\n\nYamaguchi reports, \"Here in Japan, robots are seen as more than just a tool or utility. The people are uniquely acculturated to forming emotional connections and bonds with their mechanical companions. The Japanese believe that inanimate objects are imbued with a soul.\"\n\nPepper's cohorts are also gaining a foothold in the U.S. Just last week, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. introduced its first Pepper robots to the public. The 4-foot-tall interactive bots, donated by Softbank Robotics, will be stationed at popular museum sites to answer visitors' questions, play games and pose for selfies. But robot utopia is still a ways off. For now, the Smithsonian notes that Pepper will only be able to respond with a limited number of pre-scripted answers, and does not have natural conversation abilities.\n\nRobot innovators\n\nThe work of Dr. Hiroshi Ishiguro, known as the godfather of humanoids, helped make that connection possible. He's spent years developing ever-more-lifelike robots, including one that looks remarkably like himself.\n\n\"People think my motivation is to build a robot. But it's not true. My motivation is to understand what a human is, by developing humanoid robots,\" he explained.\n\nHe envisions a world in which humanoids can substitute for humans in any role, and in which such creations are perceived just like humans.\n\nDylan Glaas, an American engineer, came to Japan because he knew the country was ready to embrace robots on an entirely new level. Gesturing towards a robot with an uncanny resemblance to an attractive young woman, he noted that just looking human is not enough. Robots also need to be able to behave and react in ways that seem natural.\n\n\"I've created her perception of the world. She can also recall back -- 'Remember when we did that?' Things like that,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously I know she's not a person,\" he said, but then again, \"When she does things well, I'm kind of proud of her.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/playing-god-crispr-dna-genetic-ethics/", "text": "At MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a couple hundred academics, scientists and biohackers gathered recently for what organizers call the first global biohacker summit. Biohackers is a term for biologists who work outside of traditional labs.\n\nJosiah Zayner, a former NASA scientist turned biohacker, stumbles into the event late, and a bit out of sorts. He's treated like a bit of a rockstar, lauded by the biohackers in attendance.\n\nBut Josiah's not having it. \"People trying to appropriate the biohacker movement. It's gross. I feel gross being here.\" He wants the movement to remain in the hands of the people -- away from the influence of the scientific establishment.\n\n\"I don't need validation (from MIT). It's like, the science should make it legitimized right? The cool stuff people do should make it legitimized.\"\n\nJosiah lives and works in Oakland, California, where he's converted a house into a scientific lab. Here, he runs a company that sells genetic engineering kits to the public. In the U.S., gene editing is technically not illegal, but federal funding is either prohibited or extremely difficult to obtain.\n\n\"What we are trying to do is make genetic engineering technology accessible to people. We want people to be able to use genetic engineering technology as easily as they could use an app on their smartphone.\"\n\nJosiah's kits start at about $150, depending on the cell cultures and organisms included for experimentation. The business, and the biohacker movement it helps service, came to exist, largely because of one new tool, called CRISPR.\n\nCRISPR is short for Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats.\n\n\"CRISPR is this amazing technology because CRISPR allows you to directly target any sequence in somebody's genome, in their genes, that you want and make whatever change you want,\" according to Josiah.\n\nThe tool consists of two key components -- a protein, which works like a pair of scissors, and what's essentially a GPS, which tells the scissors where to cut. The system can precisely cut a gene that's responsible for a disease, and replace or fix it.\n\nDr. Emmanuelle Charpintier at the Max Planck Institute in Germany is one half of the duo that discovered CRISPR's gene-cutting abilities. She and her research partner, Jennifer Doudna of UC-Berkeley, manipulated a naturally occurring defense system in bacteria.\n\nAccording to Charpintier, \"It's like a kind of film strip. The person responsible can edit the fate and the story of a life of a cell, an organism, with this technology.\"\n\nWith the help of CRISPR, the floodgates have opened to all sorts of previously unthinkable experimentation. Unlike the U.S. government's cautious approach to funding, the Chinese are all-in on CRISPR research -- providing most of the funding for dozens of the country's CRISPR projects. China currently leads the way in gene-edited firsts, including CRISPR-edited human embryos in 2015.\n\n\"The most muscular beagles in the world\"\n\nDr. Lai Liangxue is one of China's leading CRISPR researchers. \"So far I've used CRISPR on dogs, pigs, rabbit, and mice. The most exciting thing is if I want to make something in animals in biomedicine, now I can achieve very easily. Before, if I want to do that, maybe it will take me several years and millions of U.S. dollars to just achieve one genetically modified animal. Now, very fast and very inexpensive.\"\n\nCRISPR is so precise that it can just knock out the one gene that changes the physical appearance of an animal. Researchers at Lai's lab in Guangzhou, China, used CRISPR to isolate and manipulate a beagle's myostatin, or muscle gene, making these the most muscular beagles in the world. I jokingly contemplated enhancing my own muscles with gene editing, and the rabbit-hole of this technology reveals itself. It's tempting.\n\nI asked whether there's a fear of people wanting to design their own dogs. \"Actually, it excited us,\" said one doctor. \"When we confirmed that it's a CRISPR'd dog so it also excites the world.\"\n\n\"From a scientific aspect, it's very exciting. Every scientist likes this kind of technology. They can use this technology to make what they want.\"\n\nBut he concedes many are concerned about what weirdness may be created.\n\nLai takes us to see his pig farm, where he's created hundreds of mutant pigs using CRISPR. He shows us immuno-deficient pigs, whose genes were manipulated to make them more susceptible to infectious diseases. Pigs and humans share similar genomes. We have the same immune system, digestive system and suffer from many of the same diseases. According to Lai, \"If we succeed in pigs, then we can transfer this technology into humans. But so far, you know, the regulation and the law don't allow us to do that.\"\n\nThis is all very awe-inspiring, but also unsettling. \"CRISPR allows humans -- it puts so much power into our hands. The idea that we could be playing the role of God makes a lot of people nervous,\" I said to Dr. Lai.\n\nHe laughs. That concern isn't shared in China, he says. \"I think prevent disease is a good thing. A really good thing. Some genetic diseases, if we can modify it, if there is a baby with some, you know, defect, why don't we just change that? I say that depends on who use it, right? Like, like, atomic bomb. That's kind of -- if you use it to make electricity, it's good. If you use it in a bomb, it's bad.\"\n\nControversies loom large. CRISPR is not meant to be a technology that could be developed as a toy, but mention it and designer pets or designer babies often come up in conversation. The rise of genetic screenings of human embryos allow scientists to create organisms by design, rather than leave it up to chance. Combined with genetic sequencing, humanity's genetic toolbox has dramatically expanded.\n\nJosiah Zayner prepares to inject Josiah Zayner\n\nJosiah genetically modified himself with CRISPR. He used the system to edit a gene in his muscles, to make them grow faster, to be bigger and make him stronger. He did this as a proof of concept to show people how easy it is, even for biohackers operating out of small labs, to manipulate genes.\n\nHe boasts he was the first human CRISPR experiment. He says it didn't happen in a big lab with lots of resources. Josiah wants to make this technology open source and accessible to people.\n\n\"I get, like -- it's, it's been gettin' crazy now, you know? Two, three, five, 10 emails a day about people who want to use genetic engineering in some way, right? Maybe to help them with their disease.You know what no person with cancer has ever told me, ever? Like, 'Hey, I don't wanna try that out because it might hurt me.' They've never said that to me ever. 'Hey, I don't wanna try that out because it might be dangerous.'\"\n\nJosiah muses about the future possibilities with CRISPR: \"Do I wanna be big and muscly? Do I wanna -- you know, my muscles have, like, high endurance? Do I want to have dark color skin or light color skin or whatever you want. I think now is the starting place of where we get to make those choices.\"\n\n\"I think we are in the midst of a genetic revolution.

The archipelago is made up of 33 coral atolls and lies halfway between Hawaii and Australia.\n\nKiribati native Tearei Tekita's says her home was destroyed by an extremely high tide, known as a \"King Tide,\" when the water surged up from the shoreline without notice as she and her niece lay sleeping. She points to what is now a pool of water, where her home, and many others, once stood.\n\nScientists have said that the island nation, along with other low-lying Pacific nations, could be uninhabitable within decades. According to Ben Strauss, Vice President for Sea Level and Climate Impacts at Climate Central, \"Sea level is rising 50 percent faster than it was 20 years ago and that is a real cause for alarm, so it is not a future thing we are really seeing that acceleration.\" Kiribati, pronounced \"kir-ah-bahss\" by locals, has an average elevation of just 6 feet above sea level.\n\nThe low-lying archipelago of Kiribati. CBS News\n\nFor Strauss, and for the people of Kiribati, every increment of sea level rise poses great threat. \"If your maximum elevation is six feet then by the time we get to three feet I think you are in existential stress, you are going to have to have to evacuate\". For the remote country's 33 small islands that are scattered across the ocean, spanning an area the size of Alaska, evacuation is not easy. Residents told CBS News correspondent Seth Doane that they would want to leave Kiribati due to the extreme weather they face, however, the UN does not recognize climate change as grounds for refugee status.\n\nResidents spoke openly of the impact climate change has had on their way of life on the island. The high tides that inundate their homes already contaminate their water and kill their crops. Furthermore, locals face the erosion of their land and, ironically, droughts. For mother of two Etrily Karibwa, the constant lack of fresh water reserves has her trying to leave the nation she loves. Between Karibwa and her husband, they have applied for the Pacific Access Category Resident Visa 10 times consecutively, which allows a direct route to claiming residency in New Zealand to live and work indefinitely.\n\nFor Karibwa, emigrating is the only option. \"I have no choice. No other choice. If a tsunami coming or high tides been affecting our water, how can we survive for the future?\" Her fears are echoed by many. Kaboua, who lives on the Kiribati island of Abaiang, showed Doane the various, hard-hit areas where homes were washed away. Kaboua says he is saving money to send his kids elsewhere: \"Yeah, we have to move to maybe another country,\" and half-heartedly jokes, \"countries that have mountains, you know?\"\n\nFormer President Anote Tong hopes his people leave before they are forced to evacuate. \"I don't like our people to be categorized, as refugees... having lost a home, the last thing I would push to see them lose is their dignity.\" He calls on countries worldwide to take responsibility for saving his fragile nation. \"We have got to understand that climate change is not a national issue it's a global issue, and we need global thinking. We need global leadership that is what is lacking at the moment.\" For Tong, this an issue further compounded by President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord, which he deems as \"selfish.\"\n\nThe United States counts for over a quarter of the world's carbon emissions to date. Many of the Kiribati residents CBS News interviewed hold the United States accountable for the impacts they are experiencing, thousands of miles away. Tekita told CBS News she blames the United States for the loss of her home due to climate change. Yet, even having lost her home, she does not want to leave her homeland. \"Even though we lost so many: we lost our property, our home, [it] cannot change my heart,\" she said. \"The land is changing, but I'm still remain the same.

They froze staff out of their machines, rendering patient files inaccessible in a now-familiar M.O. for hackers. \"Honestly, I think it's disgusting \u2026 they're attacking some of the most vulnerable members in society by coming after a hospital,\" Pugh says.\n\nExplore more stories from \"CBSN: On Assignment\"\n\n\n\nThe hospital's CEO, Thomas Quatroche, decided not to pay the ransom, but the hack will cost them a lot of money. \"This is a form of terrorism\u2026 we decided not to pay that ransom but make no mistake about it this ... it's going to cost us a lot of money in the long run,\" he says.\n\nThousands of these attacks, of all scales, take place every day. So who can protect against these attacks? \"White-hat hackers\" are the good guys -- paid by companies to hack their systems and find flaws before they are exploited by cyber criminals, or \"black-hat hackers\".\n\nCBS News traveled to Mumbai, India to meet one of the world's best white-hat hackers, Sandeep Singh, better known by his online moniker \"Geekboy.\"\n\n\"White hat\" hackers vs \"black hat\" hackers\n\nIndia has emerged as a leading nation in the cyber war. White-hat hackers report more vulnerabilities to companies from here than hackers anywhere else in the world. \"Geekboy\" has hacked companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Uber and AirBnb -- with good intentions. And he is paid well for it -- companies offer 'bug bounties' to people who find vulnerabilities in their systems which they can then patch. \"How much I make in one day, my friends make in one year,\" Singh says.\n\nDespite being on the front lines of this cyber war, hackers like \"Geekboy\" tend to keep a low profile. \"So do you think people in this neighborhood know you're a hacker?\" Reena Ninan asked Sandeep. \"No actually\u2026 when they ask what I am doing, I tell them I'm doing my masters,\" he says.\n\nGeekboy hopes he can stop the hackers who are exploiting people for money. \"I feel disgusted - what they are doing is very bad,\" Sandeep says. \"From this side I will always try to oppose [them]... everyone and every company should hire good guys.\"\n\nBut some people question if white-hat hackers only have good intentions. \"Basically anyone can say that about any hackers\u2026 but about me - that's not something you can say,\" Geekboy says. From person to person, it can be difficult to divine their motives, and experts admit that relying on white-hat hacking is often a gamble.\n\nIf anyone knows how the world of white-hat hacking and black-hat hacking intersect, it's Hector Monsegur and Christopher Tarbell. Hector Monsegur, known as \"Sabu\" in the hacking world, founded LulzSec -- a black-hat group that hacked the CIA and Sony pictures in 2011 (Sony would be hacked again, in much more dramatic fashion, in 2014). Chris Tarbell, the former FBI agent who arrested him, convinced Sabu to help his country and defend against these attacks.\n\n\"There's a lot of different personalities involved, there's a lot of different reasons for hacking,\" Monsegur says. \"A person like me got into hacking as a form of escape. There are guys who get into it for the profit\u2026 it's hard to really pinpoint one specific motive for a hacker\u2026 but what I can say is it's very isolated.\"\n\nBut what's stopping these white-hats from being lured to the dark side? \"What if it's more valuable to me to keep information from you?\" Tarbell says. \"You're raising your risk by allowing people to come into your system\u2026 you better hope your incentive is good enough to turn over what they find.\"\n\nBut despite the risk, companies and the U.S. government might not have a choice. \"Right now in the current state of affairs hacking is growing, the threat is growing, and the FBI is going to need help to fight this cyber war,\" Tarbell says.\n\nHacking conference challenge: Break into 2016 voting machines\n\nAnd companies like Uber are recruiting that help. Sandeep traveled from India to Las Vegas to compete against the best hackers in the world for HackerOne, a hackathon where white-hat hackers look for vulnerabilities in cooperating companies. Uber was one of the companies that opened themselves up to hackers in the competition.\n\nMelanie Ensign, who handles cybersecurity for Uber says these programs incentivize white-hat hackers. \"The most important thing to remember is that somebody is always trying to hack your product whether you know it or not \u2026 it is actually the next generation of security protection.\"\n\nEven though Sandeep didn't win the most valuable hacker trophy in the three-day long competition, it was still a very emotional experience for him.\n\n\"I can go happily back home and share my experience,\" Sandeep said. \"We have more options to hack thing legally and make them more secure \u2026\"\n\nSo is white-hat hacking necessary in the fight against cyber crime? Chris Tarbell doesn't think cyberattacks are ending anytime soon. \"It's going to start the next world war if there ever is one. Hacking is going to be the first shot. It's going to happen six months before any military person steps on the shore.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/i-asked-amazon-alexa-google-assistant-how-to-find-my-data-heres-what-they-said/", "text": "We asked two of the most popular smart home assistants \u2014 Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant \u2014 how to find the user data their devices collected about us. The Google Home device promptly directed us to the Google Home app and google.com/myactivity. But after multiple attempts, Amazon's Alexa was unable to answer the question, \"How do I access my data?\"\n\nIt didn't seem like too much to ask of the voice-activated devices that are taking up residence in millions of American homes, but Alexa appeared to be caught by surprise.\n\nAmazon and Google's artificial intelligent virtual assistants are being built into smart speakers, phones, security systems, televisions and even cars. Over the past 18 months, Amazon and Google captured more than 50 percent of the smart home market share. At the CES 2019 consumer electronics show, Google announced users could soon find Google Assistant on nearly one billion devices worldwide, including Android phones. Meanwhile, Amazon has sold about 100 million devices with access to Alexa.\n\nThe appeal of these devices is clear: we can speak our commands and questions into the air and get a near-instant response. After calling out \"OK, Google\" or \"Alexa \" \u2014 the command that \"wakes\" and activates the device \u2014 the user's request is then heard, processed and, ideally, quickly answered. Say, \"Alexa, what's in the news?\" and the day's headlines come right up.\n\nWhere a user's voice data goes after that moment is less clear. If you ask these very devices where you can find your data, Google Assistant tells you, \"Google stores data about our conversations on its servers. You can see your activity in the Google Home app or at: google.com/myactivity.\" There, we could see a list of every question and command we'd ever given Google Home, and had the option to delete them.\n\nAmazon's Alexa software had a bit more trouble with the question. We asked it a variety of different ways, including \"How can I see my data?\"( which is the command Google responded to), as well as \"How can I see what data you have collected on my voice commands?\" and \"Where do I see what data is stored by Amazon?\" To each question, Alexa responded that she was \"not sure,\" or \"hmm, I don't know that one.\"\n\nSo we emailed an Amazon spokesperson to learn the answer. Here's what they told us.\n\n\"We collect and use voice data in order to deliver and improve our services,\" said the Amazon spokesperson. \"This includes helping train Alexa to better understand natural language when you speak to her and provide you with the right response to your requests.\"\n\nTo learn about voice data collection, we were directed by the spokesperson to a notice on Amazon.com called \"Alexa, Echo Devices and Your Privacy,\" which explains in more detail how voice data is collected by smart home devices, how those files are stored in the cloud, and how to review and delete them.\n\nWe also discovered (by Googling it) a privacy notice on Amazon.com that states, \"Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.\" The company specifies that some information is shared with various Amazon subsidiaries, third-party service providers and affiliated businesses.\n\nIn actuality, the process for viewing and deleting your Amazon data is similar to Google's. If you go to the Alexa app, then to \"Settings,\" then to \"History,\" users can see individual voice recordings their device captured and then can delete them if they choose. Amazon says you can also do this at amazon.com/alexaprivacy.\n\nHow the Internet of Things is changing homes and global industries\n\nIf users don't delete the files, as Google made clear, the data remains stored on the tech giant's servers. In Google's online Safety Center, the company writes, \"We do not sell your personal information to anyone.\" It says it uses the data to \"serve you relevant ads in Google products, on partner websites and in mobile apps.\"\n\nGoogle and Amazon's attempts to provide transparency and give users more control over their data come in the wake of some massive data privacy scandals, such as Facebook allowing Cambridge Analytica to get its hands on millions of users' data without their consent. A strict new privacy protection law went into effect in Europe last spring, but the U.S. has no such federal standard.\n\nIn the end, with a little effort, we did get answers to our question about how to find our data. But big questions remain about how our personal information may be used by tech giants in the years ahead \u2014 even as we welcome more and more of their devices into our homes."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/record-breaking-jet-stream-accelerates-air-travel-el-nino-polar-vortex/", "text": "On Monday night, the river of air 35,000 feet above the New York City area, known as the jet stream, clocked in at a blazing 231 mph. This is the fastest jet stream on record since 1957 for the National Weather Service in Upton, New York \u2014 breaking the old record of 223 mph, according to NWS forecaster Carlie Buccola.\n\nThis wind provided a turbo boost to commercial passenger planes along for the ride. With the help of this rapid tailwind, Virgin Atlantic Flight 8 from Los Angeles to London hit what could be a record high speed for a Boeing 787: 801 mph over Pennsylvania at 9:20 p.m. Monday night.\n\n\"Wow, that's fast,\" a Boeing spokesman told CBS News via email. But it's not something the plane manufacturer tracks, so they can't confirm if 801 mph is a record.\n\n\"The typical cruising speed of the Dreamliner is 561 mph,\" CBS News transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave points out. \"The past record for the 787 is 776 mph set in January 2017 by a Norwegian 787-9 flying from JFK to London Gatwick. That flight set a record for the fastest subsonic transatlantic commercial airline flight \u2014 5 hours and 13 minutes, thanks to a 202 mph tailwind.\"\n\nFor reference, the speed of sound is 760 mph; but the plane did not break the sound barrier. That's because part of the plane's speed is attributed to the swiftly moving 200 mph+ air surrounding the plane. So relative to the air around it, the plane's speed falls far short.\n\nJet streams like the one Monday can have a big impact on flights.\n\n\"A 100 mph increase in the jet stream above typical can add or remove about an hour from a five to six hour flight,\" according to a spokesperson from FlightAware, a global aviation software and data services company based in Houston.\n\nWhile you might be pleasantly surprised by an early arrival going eastbound, you're likely to face delays westbound battling the powerful headwind. While winds of this magnitude do affect air travel, FlightAware said changes in the upper level winds are accounted for.\n\n\"The estimated jet stream winds are accounted for in flight planning, and even before that in scheduling you'll see longer block times westbound than eastbound,\" FlightAware points out.\n\nIn the interactive map above, created by Cameron Beccario, the jet stream intensity can be viewed (updated every three hours).\n\nWhat's causing the record jet stream?\n\nThe record jet stream winds were not only confined to the New York City area, it was a common theme all over the Northeast because of a unique confluence of events.\n\nIt all started in the Pacific Ocean: Just last week NOAA declared an official El Ni\u00f1o in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o is a warming of the equatorial sea surface temperatures which can have repercussions thousands of miles away. It is partly responsible for the recent wicked weather in California last week.\n\n\"The last couple weeks the atmosphere has been in a much more El Ni\u00f1o-like state because it's teaming up with another natural climate phenomena known as the MJO,\" said Dr. Adam Sobel, professor of applied physics at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \"The MJO is associated with clusters of thunderstorms and bursts of westerly winds.\"\n\nAs a result of this energetic mix, twin cyclones have formed in the central Pacific and all this activity is spawning an unusually powerful sub-tropical jet stream across Mexico and into the southern U.S.\n\nAt the same time, a vigorous polar jet stream in Alaska is splitting into two branches along the Pacific Coast. One is heading east through the Great Lakes, while the other heads south into California and then turns east into the Ohio Valley.\n\nThe end result is all three jet streams \u2014 along with an assist from the polar vortex \u2014 are now merging in the Northeast. This is boosting an otherwise strong jet stream, into a record breaking one.\n\nThe confluence of events is much more easily understood by looking at the following illustration:\n\nA look at the jet stream Tue., Feb. 19, 2019. CBS News\n\nThe moist and energetic jet stream will remain in place through the weekend. As a result, dangerous flooding is possible across parts of the Mississippi and Tennessee Valley with a widespread 5-10 inches of rain possible in some areas."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/galaxy-s10-fold-release-samsung-new-foldable-phone-costs-1980-new-s10-models-including-galaxy-s10-5g-watch-fit-earbuds/", "text": "Wednesday, Samsung presented their new line of smartphones.

Esports teams are already scrambling to sign talented players and invest long-term, while others are raising concerns about overcommitting to the suddenly volatile battle royale genre.\n\nDeveloped by Respawn Entertainment and published by EA, \"Apex\" has shaken the industry by building on many of its shining successes. It has pulled popular elements from other battle royales \u2013 a type of video game where players are dropped into a map and fight in a last-man-standing format against up to 100 other gamers \u2013 while making a few key changes.\n\nFree to play\n\nLike \"Fortnite\" and \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,\" ''Apex\" is free to download and play, making its money by selling outfits and other upgrades for use in the game. Among its key differences: \"Apex\" players compete exclusively in teams of three and can choose characters with varying abilities, features essential to team-based esports like \"League of Legends\" and \"Overwatch.\"\n\nThe game also went hard after the existing battle royale audience. EA recruited Blevins, Richard \"KingRichard\" Nelson and other famous gamers, asking them to put down \"Fortnite\" and stream \"Apex\" following its release Feb. 4. Blevins alone has over 13 million subscribers on Twitch, immediately giving \"Apex\" a massive audience. It's unclear if EA paid those influencers to play the game, and EA did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\n\"Apex\" had 25 million downloads in its first week, crushing the \"Fortnite\" mark of 10 million over its first two weeks after launching in 2017.\n\n\"I think 'Apex' has caught everybody by storm,\" said Andy Miller, CEO of NRG Esports, which rosters teams across various video game titles. \"They did a phenomenal job of getting the influencers to play it first, feeding the market on Twitch and then watching everybody starting to play the game, and the game is good.\"\n\nRecruiting \"Apex\" players\n\nSix days after the game launched, NRG announced it was recruiting \"Apex\" players, making it the first esports organization to seek a pro specifically for that title. General manager Jaime Cohenca led the search, combing through applications and Twitch streams. With the game being so new, Cohenca wasn't entirely sure what he was looking for other than an \"exceptional talent.\"\n\nHe \"knew immediately\" when he came across Dizzy.\n\nCoby \"Dizzy\" Meadows is an 18-year-old from Florida, and he is believed to be the best \"Apex\" player in the world. NRG signed him Feb. 12, and later that day, Meadows made major waves in the esports community by killing 33 of his 59 opponents in one match \u2014 a viral moment that generated nearly 500,000 views on YouTube alone. The next day, Meadows teamed up with Blevins and Nelson, also an NRG player, to win the $200,000 Twitch Rivals Apex Legends tournament against a lineup of streaming megastars.\n\nBehind big draws for Dizzy, Ninja and KingRichard, \"Apex\" smashed another \"Fortnite\" record that day: 8.28 million hours of \"Apex\" were streamed on Twitch, topping the \"Fortnite\" mark of 6.6 million from July 20, per The Esports Observer.\n\nMeadows has played regularly with Blevins and Nelson since. They won another tournament together later that week, and in the finals, Meadows had as many kills on his own as the entire opposing team.\n\n\"We knew this was a kid we had to take a flyer on,\" Cohenca said. \"Dizzy was a rock star.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe question now: What comes next for \"Apex,\" ''Fortnite,\" and the stars and companies building up around their popularity? No doubt, NRG's fast move on Meadows has paid off, and other top esports organizations have since begun recruiting their own \"Apex\" pros. But it's still not clear what kind of scene they're staffing up for.\n\nEpic Games, the developer behind \"Fortnite,\" hasn't prioritized that game's competitive sphere in the same way that companies behind \"League of Legends\" or \"Overwatch\" have. Top \"Fortnite\" players like Blevins aren't necessarily stars because they win every tournament. Ninja is a skilled gamer, for sure, but what has separated him is that he's entertaining, a talent that pairs well with a goofier game like \"Fortnite.\"\n\n\"Apex\" lacks those cartoonish vibes, and its rules and structure could lend it better to competitive esports \u2014 where skill and teamwork become more important than engaging on Twitch. EA has experience building leagues around its games, too, most notably with sports titles like Madden and FIFA.\n\nRight now, it's unclear where \"Apex\" is going, and for how long it can hold that space. That's part of why Ari Segal, CEO at Immortals, has been hesitant to invest in battle royale players. He remains cautious, especially now that \"Apex\" has drawn up such a spectacular blueprint for entering the market.\n\n\"It's a well-oiled flywheel that likely means new battle royale games will increasingly be able to launch to faster and larger success, at least initially,\" he said.\n\n\"Apex\" squad\n\nImmortals and NRG are at opposite ends of that spectrum, in many ways. NRG already has plans to build out a full \"Apex\" team so it's ready to put a talented squad in the field no matter the competitive and streaming structure.

These jets can extend over millions of light years.\n\n\"LOFAR has a remarkable sensitivity and that allows us to see that these jets are present in all of the most massive galaxies, which means that their black holes never stop eating,\" said Philip Best, a professor of extragalactic astrophysics at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nBlack holes have a gravitational pull so strong that no matter can escape them.

Wallace Smith Broecker was 87.\n\nThe longtime Columbia University professor and researcher died Monday at a New York City hospital, according to a spokesman for the university's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Kevin Krajick said Broecker had been ailing in recent months.\n\nBroecker brought \"global warming\" into common use with a 1975 article that correctly predicted rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced warming. He later became the first person to recognize what he called the Ocean Conveyor Belt, a global network of currents affecting everything from air temperature to rain patterns.\n\n\"Wally was unique, brilliant and combative,\" said Princeton University professor Michael Oppenheimer. \"He wasn't fooled by the cooling of the 1970s. He saw clearly the unprecedented warming now playing out and made his views clear, even when few were willing to listen.\"\n\nNovember 2008 file photo shows Wallace Broecker addressing audience during Balzan prize ceremony in Rome Gregorio Borgia / AP\n\nIn the Ocean Conveyor Belt, cold, salty water in the North Atlantic sinks, working like a plunger to drive an ocean current from near North America to Europe. Warm surface waters borne by this current help keep Europe's climate mild.\n\nOtherwise, he said, Europe would be in a deep freeze, with average winter temperatures dropping by 20 degrees Fahrenheit or more and London feeling more like Spitsbergen, Norway, which is 600 miles north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nBroecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor is the \"Achilles heel of the climate system\" and a fragile phenomenon that can change rapidly for reasons not understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt. Broecker said it is possible that warming caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases could be enough to affect the ocean currents dramatically.\n\n\"Broecker single-handedly popularized the notion that this could lead to a dramatic climate change 'tipping point' and, more generally, Broecker helped communicate to the public and policymakers the potential for abrupt climate changes and unwelcome 'surprises' as a result of climate change,\" said Penn State professor Michael Mann.\n\nIn 1984, Broecker told a House subcommittee that the buildup of greenhouse gases warranted a \"bold, new national effort aimed at understanding the operation of the realms of the atmosphere, oceans, ice and terrestrial biosphere.\"\n\n\"We live in a climate system that can jump abruptly from one state to another,\" Broecker told the Associated Press in 1997. By dumping into the atmosphere huge amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, \"we are conducting an experiment that could have devastating effects.\"\n\n\"We're playing with an angry beast - a climate system that has been shown to be very sensitive,\" he said.\n\nBroecker received the National Medal of Science in 1996 and was a member of the National Academy of Science. He also served a stint as the research coordinator for Biosphere 2, an experimental living environment turned research lab.\n\nBroecker was born in Chicago in 1931 and grew up in suburban Oak Park.\n\nHe joined Columbia's faculty in 1959, spending most of his time at the university's laboratory in Palisades, New York. He was known in science circles as the \"Grandfather of Climate Science\" and the \"Dean of Climate Scientists.\"\n\n\"His discoveries were fundamental to interpreting Earth's climate history,\" said Oppenheimer. \"No scientist was more stimulating to engage with: he was an instigator in a good way, willing to press unpopular ideas, like lofting particles to offset climate change. But it was always a two-way conversation, never dull, always educational.

This close approach is called perigee by astronomers. In 2019, there are three supermoons and they fall in the first three months of the year.\n\nYou may recall in January we had the spectacle of the \"super blood wolf moon\" in which a lunar eclipse or \"blood moon\" coincided with a supermoon and the first full moon of the calendar year, traditionally called the wolf moon.\n\nTuesday evening will bring the \"super snow moon.\" Due to a number of nuances in the interactions between the sun, Earth and moon, the distance between us and and each supermoon varies a bit. It just so happens that this week's perigee will be about 362 miles closer to us than last month's supermoon, according to NASA.\n\nThe full moon is seen in Nobeoka City, Miyazaki Prefecture on February 19, 2019; the phenomenon of \"supermoon'' happens when the orb is at its closest point to Earth and looks larger than usual Katsumi Tanaka / AP\n\nYou'd need to have a remarkably trained eye to notice the difference between each supermoon. It's hard enough to even see the difference between a regular full moon and a supermoon, which only appears up to 14 percent larger in the sky and maybe 30 percent brighter.\n\nIf you really want to be wowed, your best bet is to check out the full moon when it rises in the east as the sun is setting in the west. This is when it will appear to be biggest, although this is mostly due to an optical illusion.\n\nThis happens when the moon is close to the horizon and there are objects such as trees or buildings within our line of sight, NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams explains. \"Because these relatively close objects are in front of the moon, our brain is tricked into thinking the moon is much closer to the objects that are in our line of sight,\" Adams says.\n\nAdams adds that you can check the effect by holding a coin at arm's length so it covers the moon. Do this at moonrise when the moon appears huge on the horizon and later when it looks smaller high in the sky and you'll see that the same size coin covers the moon the whole night.\n\nIt should be obvious why a February full moon is traditionally called a \"snow moon\" in the United States. The second calendar month is historically more filled with fluffy white precipitation than any other.\n\nThis also means the super snow moon has a better chance of being blocked from view by, well ... snowfall. If that happens, there's still the third and final supermoon of 2019, which comes in exactly four weeks, on March 19.\n\nThis article first appeared in CNET"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-says-will-cut-its-carbon-footprint-after-pressure-from-activists-and-employees/", "text": "Amazon, which ships millions of packages a year to shopper's doorsteps, says it wants to be greener.

Shutterstock\n\nA pall of eerie black snow has covered several towns in the Siberian region of Kuzbass, which is home to 2.6 million people and one of the world's largest coal fields.\n\nAccording to the Guardian and the Siberian Times, the snow is tainted with toxic black coal dust that was released into the air from open coal pits and improperly maintained factories in the region. One coal plant official told the local media that a shield meant to prevent coal powder from escaping out of the factory had malfunctioned \u2014 however, toxic black snowfall seems to be a regular phenomena in the area and it isn't necessarily tied to a single source. [The Frozen North: Stunning Images of Russia from Above]\n\n\"It's harder to find white snow than black snow during the winter,\" Vladimir Slivyak, a member of the non-profit environmental action group Ecodefense, told the Guardian. \"There is a lot of coal dust in the air all the time. When snow falls, it just becomes visible. You can't see it the rest of the year, but it is still there.\"\n\nKuzbass (short for Kuznetsk Basin) is one of the largest coalfields in the world, spanning more than 10,000 square miles (26,000 square kilometers), according to Britannica.com. A 2015 report from Ecodefense found that the citizens of Kuzbass have an average life expectancy 3 to 4 years shorter than the Russian national average and have nearly twice the risk of contracting tuberculosis and childhood mental disorders.\n\nBlack snows like this one are a frequent winter feature in the region, the report found, and mitigation attempts have been\u2026 lacking. For instance, in December 2018, regional authorities were accused of trying to hide the toxic black stuff by literally painting over it with white pigment, the Moscow Times reported.\n\nSiberia, which would be the world's largest country by size if it were a sovereign nation, is no stranger to bizarre environmental disasters. In July 2018, a Siberian factory town was drenched in a red \"blood rain\" when improperly stored industrial waste was caught up in a storm. Later that month, a mysterious wall of dust blacked out the sun for 3 hours in Yakutia, a region that contains some of the coldest cities in the world.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, several British groups have proposed boycotting Kuzbass coal until the region enacts stronger environmental protections, The simple fact is, however, that there's no great way to make coal use environmentally friendly.

Traditional banks are paying roughly 0.22 percent on savings and money market deposit accounts, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for BankRate.com, a consumer information and rate-shopping site.\n\nNormally, consumer deposits command about 50 percent of the fed funds rate, according to G. Michael Moebs, economist and chief executive of bank consulting firm Moebs Services. That would mean rates in the 1.25 percent range today -- about 80 percent more than consumers are actually getting for deposits at big banks, he said.\n\nBlame it on scant loan demand\n\n\n\nWhy are savers locked out? Supply and demand. And in this case, it's because loan demand simply isn't strong enough for banks -- at least big banks -- to push lending rates higher, which in turn would boost deposit rates as bank profits climb from lending, said Moebs. Internet-based banks are an exception. Many are paying more than the industry norm.\n\nTo make sense of it all, let's take a step back.\n\nRemember the scene in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" where George Bailey tries to quell a run on the Bailey Brothers Building and Loan by explaining where depositors' money has gone? That is, indeed, how banks and thrifts operate: They take in deposits at one rate of interest, and turn around and loan out that cash at a higher rate, making a profit on the margin between the two.\n\nHowever, Bailey's Building and Loan was loaning money largely to homeowners who needed mortgages, while big banks typically use their deposits to finance commercial loans to businesses.\n\nDemand for commercial loans is currently tepid. Experts cite several reasons. First, when interest rates were at record lows, many big companies issued long-term bonds. Bonds are essentially IOUs -- you invest a set amount, and the bond issuer promises to pay you interest at a set annual rate and pay back the principal at some point in the future.\n\nBut because interest rates were so low, even companies that didn't have an immediate need for the cash issued bonds to create a pool of funds to finance future growth rather than borrow the money from banks.\n\nBurned by the Great Recession\n\n\n\nSmaller companies didn't do that, but they also aren't spending fast enough to push up loan demand. Why? The lessons of the Great Recession are still fresh in their minds, McBride said.\n\n\"Most companies aren't comfortable sticking their necks out and taking risk because the scars of 2008 are still visible,\" he said. \"No one wants to be sitting on a warehouse full of inventory that they can't move.\"\n\nMeanwhile, gathering sufficient deposits to finance existing loan demand is easy for big, national banks because their ubiquitous branch systems and automated teller systems act as giant catcher's mitts, gathering up trillions in consumer deposits, McBride said.\n\nInternet-based banks are another story. Without massive branch systems and ATM networks, these banks have both lower costs (fewer offices and employees to pay) and a greater need to woo depositors. Consequently, many pay as much as 10 times more for deposits than traditional banks that support expensive branch networks.\n\n\"You've got to be very selective about where you put your savings to get the best return,\" said McBride. \"Most banks are very stingy with their payouts.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-maximize-roth-401k-ira-retirement-savings/", "text": "Saving money in a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA is one of the best long-term ways to build tax-free retirement savings. Money invested in Roth accounts grows tax-deferred, and all money -- including investment gains -- is completely tax-free when withdrawn in retirement.\n\nBut of course, you'll have to follow the rules that regulate Roths. For instance, how much you can contribute to a Roth IRA each year is limited to $6,000 in 2019, or $7,000 for those age 50 and older. And those with higher incomes ($137,000 for single tax filers and $203,000 for marrieds filing jointly) -- who would benefit the most from a Roth IRA -- can't make Roth contributions.\n\nHowever, if you want to contribute more than the limits allow and to maximize your Roth retirement savings by thousands of additional dollars, you have some options.\n\nSlip in the \"back door\"\n\n\n\nOne way to get around the contribution limits is to take advantage of the \"back-door Roth IRA\" strategy. You do this by making aftertax contributions to your employer's 401(k) plan and then transferring those contributions to a Roth IRA. Even those with incomes above the limits can do it.\n\nHere's the catch: You must participate in an 401(k) that allows aftertax contributions and allows you to take an \"in-service withdrawal\" of these aftertax contributions.\n\nHere's how a \"back-door Roth\" works. The first step is to \"top-up\" your 401(k) with aftertax contributions. In 2019, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $19,000, or $25,000 for workers age 50 and older, plus an employer match of up to $6,000. A lot of 401(k)s also permit aftertax contributions up to a total IRS maximum of $56,000, or $62,000 for workers age 50 and older. So if in 2019 you contribute $19,000, and your employer match is $6,000, you can make an additional top-up aftertax contribution of $31,000 ($56,000 less the $19,000 and $6,000) or $37,000 for workers age 50 and older.\n\nTake your money and move it\n\n\n\nThe next step is to immediately take an \"in-service withdrawal\" of the additional aftertax contributions and transfer it to a Roth IRA. This works best if you do it right after the extra contributions are made so that little or no earnings have accrued on the aftertax contributions. If you take a withdrawal of aftertax money that has grown in the plan, you'll also have to withdraw the earnings attributed to that money.\n\nWhile the withdrawn earnings can be taxable, you're allowed to roll over the untaxed earnings to a traditional IRA. When you do that, the earnings won't be included in your taxable income until withdrawn from the traditional IRA later. Make sure you open a Roth IRA before you do this. When you do, you'll be ready to deposit the aftertax money into the new account when it's distributed.\n\nOr convert it within your plan\n\n\n\nAnother way to supersize the money you save in Roth accounts is to take advantage of a special feature in a 401(k) plan. Some employers allow for what's known as a Roth 401(k) in-plan conversions within their 401(k). Similar to the \"back-door Roth IRA,\" participants make aftertax contributions up to the plan's limits. Instead of taking an \"in-service withdrawal,\" the participant elects the in-plan conversion feature, and the contributions are automatically converted to Roth-type contributions.\n\nSome plans, such as Google's, are rolling this out as an automatic feature at year-end. This will allow employees to take advantage of this valuable feature beginning 2019.\n\nPlan carefully and with help\n\n\n\nIt's important to remember that Roth savings works best as part of a long-term investment strategy. The longer money is invested in a Roth, the more investment gains will be in the account, which will be tax-free when withdrawn many years down the road.\n\nAlso, before you proceed, make sure the money you save in Roth type accounts won't be needed for any other purpose than retirement. To benefit from tax-free withdrawals, funds in Roth accounts must have been invested at least five years and withdrawn after age 59\u00bd.\n\nAlso, Roth accounts aren't subject to the required minimum distribution rules that apply to those over age 70 who own other IRAs and retirement accounts.\n\nBefore starting a Roth-maximizing strategy, run it by your tax and financial advisers."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/an-irs-rule-that-can-aid-your-retirement-income-strategy/", "text": "The year-end deadline for the IRS required minimum distribution (RMD) is looming for retirees age 70\u00bd and older. These IRS rules require you to withdraw minimum amounts from traditional IRAs and work-based savings plans like a 401(k). If you don't take out at least the minimum required, any shortfall in your annual withdrawal is subject to a 50 percent penalty -- so it's smart to make at least the minimum withdrawal to avoid this penalty.\n\nIf you've never had to deal with this requirement before, you might think it provides a sort of roadmap for making appropriate withdrawals from your retirement savings. However, the RMD wasn't actually intended to be used that way. Instead, its main purpose is to subject your savings to income taxes because you didn't pay taxes on the money when you contributed it to your retirement account. There's one exception: The RMD also applies to withdrawals from Roth 401(k) accounts, even though these withdrawals aren't included in your taxable income. RMDs don't apply to Roth IRAs.\n\nStill, many retirees use the RMD to determine the annual amount they'll withdraw from their savings. Is this a reasonable strategy? The answer depends on your goals and objectives. Let's take a look.\n\nHow the RMD works\n\n\n\nThe RMD calculates the minimum withdrawal amount by taking your account balance on Dec. 31 and dividing it by your life expectancy, as outlined in IRS Publication 590-B. To make things easier, the RMD rules can be converted into a series of withdrawal percentages, as shown the following table from my recent book, \"Retirement Game-Changers.\"\n\nIRS\n\nFor example, suppose you have $100,000 in retirement savings on Dec. 31 and you're subject to the rules for the first time because you attained age 70\u00bd this year. Your RMD would be $3,650 (that's 3.65 percent of $100,000). If you want to use the RMD methodology to determine withdrawal amounts before age 70\u00bd, you can use a simple withdrawal rate of 3.5 percent.\n\nThe RMD does have a few features that represent best practices for withdrawing from invested savings. First, the method adjusts your withdrawal each year to reflect investment returns -- favorable returns can boost your withdrawals, whereas poor returns will reduce them. This is more desirable than withdrawing a fixed amount each year, ignoring investment returns.\n\nSecond, the withdrawal percentage increases each year, automatically adjusting for your remaining life expectancy, which reduces as you age.\n\nOne significant advantage of the RMD is that most IRA or 401(k) plan administrators can easily determine the right amount for you, so you don't have to make complicated calculations. Many will also automatically pay the RMD to you in the frequency you elect, such as monthly, quarterly or annually.\n\nOne good strategy could be to withdraw the total RMD amount from your invested assets as soon as possible after the beginning of the calendar year and instruct your IRA or 401(k) administrator to transfer it electronically to your checking or savings account. You can withdraw amounts as needed throughout the year to pay for your living expenses. With this approach, your withdrawal amount won't be subject to investment volatility throughout the year.\n\nA two-step approach\n\n\n\nA recent study by the Stanford Center on Longevity systematically compared 292 different retirement income strategies, including optimizing Social Security benefits, systematic withdrawals from invested assets and purchasing a lifetime annuity. It came up with what it calls the Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy as a strong contender for a retirement income strategy to consider. It has two steps:\n\nOptimize Social Security Use the IRS RMD to determine annual withdrawals\n\nThis strategy compared favorably to more complex strategies.\n\nStill, using the IRS RMD to determine your annual withdrawals has a few disadvantages:\n\nThe withdrawal amount can fluctuate significantly from year to year if you have a significant allocation to stocks. Whether this is a problem depends on how much you're relying on your withdrawals to meet your basic living expenses. Some people might not tolerate a reduction in their spending due to a declining stock market, or worse, a crash. If that's the case, consider investing a portion of your savings in a low-cost fixed-income annuity that isn't subject to investment volatility.\n\nYou may want to withdraw more than the RMD, for example, if you want to travel more during the early part of your retirement when you're still active and healthy. In that case, you can set aside a \"fun bucket\" that equals an estimate of the extra amounts you want to spend in your go-go years. Suppose you want to spend $5,000 per year on travel for the first 10 years of your retirement. You would then set aside $50,000 from the rest of your retirement savings, withdraw the RMD from that amount and also withdraw $5,000 from your \"fun bucket.\"\n\nNo matter what you decide to do, you should spend the time it takes to develop a thoughtful retirement income strategy that will last the rest of your life, no matter how long you live and no matter what happens in the stock market. Then enjoy your retirement."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/half-of-america-hasnt-recovered-from-the-recession/", "text": "A decade after the financial crisis, the U.S. economy seems to be firing on all cylinders, with unemployment at a 50-year low and growth hitting its stride. But a deeper look reveals a more troubling picture: Between 2012 and 2015 -- a period when the recovery seemed to be gaining speed -- nearly half of all counties nationwide saw flat or declining growth, according to new government data.\n\nMore broadly, the Commerce Department figures highlight a stark and worrisome reality: While a handful of places around the U.S. are thriving, most regions are barely trudging ahead. And that trend is creating a widening geographic gap between a relatively few prosperous areas, mostly urban oases, and the desert of stagnation that lies beyond.\n\n\"For many communities, what you've got is a lost decade of economic growth,\" said John Lettieri, CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan think tank, adding that \"the topline economy doesn't match the local experiences.\"\n\nThis is what inequality looks like\n\nThe bottom third of U.S. counties actually saw their economies shrink. Gross domestic product in these places, whose ranks include St. Clair County, Missouri, and Macon County, Illinois, shrank by an average of 2.25 percent each year between 2013 and 2015. (GDP represents the sum total of all the goods and services produced in a location in a given year.) For another 20 percent of counties, growth averaged an anemic 0.6 percent a year during that period.\n\nBy contrast, the few counties that did perform well economically saw spectacular growth. The top tenth expanded their economies by 11 percent every year between 2013 and 2015.\n\nFor comparison, the nation's overall GDP grew 1.8 percent in 2013, 2.5 percent the following year and 2.9 percent in 2015. Economists expect growth of around 3 percent this year.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Commerce data represent the first time the Bureau of Economic Analysis has issued county-level data. So they should be considered preliminary. And local economies, because they're often so small, can see large percentage shifts from one year to the next.\n\nStill, EIG has found a similar divergence in taking a more granular approach to measuring economic growth. Perhaps the clearest sign of the imbalance between have and have-not counties: Between 2007 and 2016, the U.S. added 3.7 million net new jobs, Lettieri said. But more than 90 percent of those were created in the richest 20 percent of ZIP codes.\n\nLooking at individual employers shows the same story. Between 2007 and 2016, the country added about 53,000 businesses, according to Census data. But just five counties together added even more -- about 55,000 businesses. The winners: the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens in New York; Los Angeles; Florida's Miami-Dade; and Harris County, Texas (home to Houston).\n\nWhile the majority of densely populated counties added businesses, most counties with a population of less than 500,000 lost businesses from 2007 to 2016. Among the smallest counties (fewer than 100,000 people) only 1 in 5 added businesses over that time period.\n\n\"At the root of this is a question of whether, from one generation to the next, people feel that the economy gives them a fair shot at the American Dream,\" Lettieri said. \"If you're increasingly segregating the American population into places that are opportunity-rich and hard to get into\u2026 that divide between prosperous and distresses places, that threatens the idea of fundamental fairness to our system.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/couples-rush-to-divorce-by-year-end-for-tax-purposes/", "text": "'Tis the season to get divorced. Attorneys are working overtime to help sparring spouses untie the knot before the new year, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will change the way payments between ex-partners are taxed.\n\nDivorce lawyers around the U.S. say they've seen up to four-fold increases in their workloads, while courts are also staying open longer to accommodate the flurry of couples scrambling to make their divorces official so they can benefit from allowances under previous tax rules.\n\nIn a memo obtained by CBS MoneyWatch, Florida Judge Tarlika Navarro recently cited the \"changing tax laws\" in saying she would make herself available for hearings over the Christmas holiday \u2014 that includes court extra sessions Dec. 27 and Dec. 28, when the court is normally closed.\n\nLynne Strober, co-chair of the matrimonial and family law practice group at Mandelbaum Salsburg in Roseland, New Jersey, said she is working \"crazy hours\" to complete divorce settlements by year-end.\n\n\"Everyday I am working on getting a different case resolved,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nWhy the rush to split?\n\nUnder current law, the person on the hook for alimony in a divorce \u2014 typically the higher-earning spouse \u2014 can deduct payments from their income, and it is the lower-earning ex who is taxed on that sum.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Trump in late 2017, shifts the tax burden from the alimony recipient to the person writing the check. That could mean more revenue for the federal government given that the payer is usually in a higher tax bracket.\n\nIn changing the tax law, the House Ways and Means Committee called the current treatment of alimony a \"divorce subsidy,\" arguing that \"a divorced couple can often achieve a better tax result for payments between them than a married couple can.\"\n\nKeeping an eye on finances during a divorce\n\nDueling spouses have often separated and filed for divorces in January, after family holiday obligations are endured, but the looming tax deadline also gives couples incentive to finalize a split quickly. Steven J. Mandel, a family law attorney based in New York City, said he saw a big uptick in couples filing for divorce in June and July.\n\nIn most cases, he noted, his clients were already planning \u2014 or at least considering \u2014 a divorce. \"I've never heard a couple say, 'Let's get divorced to save some money on our taxes,' \" he said.\n\nDivorcing couples hoping to beat the clock are now at the mercy of the court system \u2014 which has a backlog of cases waiting to be heard. \"We have been calling up the clerk and court personnel to see if there is anyway we can get our clients' cases expedited,\" Mandel said.\n\nGlenn A. Grant, acting administrative director of the New Jersey Courts, this month notified the state bar of the changes in the tax law related to alimony, urging attorneys to schedule uncontested hearings immediately.\n\n\"The Judiciary anticipates a higher than usual number of individuals seeking to obtain a final judgment of divorce prior to the end of the year,\" the notice read. \"The Judiciary will endeavor to accommodate attorneys' requests to resolve these uncontested matters as expeditiously as possible,\" it continued.\n\nWinners and losers in 2019 and beyond\n\nSome professionals say that alimony recipients \u2014 who are overwhelmingly women \u2014 will benefit from the new law by avoiding taxes.\n\n\"One could argue that the new tax law, by getting rid of the deduction, hurts the higher-earning ex-spouse and it helps the lower-earning ex-spouse. That's what should be the answer, but in reality it's not nearly that clear,\" said Dan Caplinger an analyst with the financial website Motley Fool.\n\nStart preparing your tax return now to maximize your return\n\nOthers say it is alimony recipients who will be worse off when the new law kicks in. That's because under existing law an attorney for the payee could argue that a former spouse should offer higher monthly payment given the accompanying tax deduction. But that legal rationale will disappear beginning in January.\n\n\"In some cases, that was a compelling argument, and advocates are concerned that by losing the deduction the lower-earning spouse loses leverage to negotiate payments,\" Caplinger said.\n\nThe tax deduction certainly makes paying alimony more palatable, according to Source Financial Advisors CEO Michelle Smith.\n\n\"It makes you think, 'OK, at least if I earn $2 million and lose $300,000 in alimony I get to deduct it, which brings my adjusted gross income to $1.7 million,' \" she said, adding that \"Male wage earners are definitely pressing for signing [their divorce settlement] by December 31.\"\n\nFamilies penalized post-divorce\n\nIf the government's coffers could swell as a result of the tax law's new treatment of divorces, another party could suffer -- families, as alimony payers are forced to cough up more in taxes.\n\n\"You are still a family after a divorce, and the family loses money that could be used if kids need something extra,\" she said. \"It's a significant amount of money, and if a divorce is well along to settling anyway, it's a good idea to hurry up and get divorced now.\"\n\nPeter M. Walzer, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, estimates a 20 percent increase in divorce filings this year compared to 2017. But the new law will likely have a negligible effect on divorce rates in the future.\n\n\"The research indicates that tax policy does influence decisions about getting married and staying married, but this influence is modest,\" said Brad Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project and sociology professor at the University of Virginia.\n\n\"Changes in tax-related alimony deductions are not likely to have a huge impact on either the timing or likelihood of divorce for married couples in America.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-tax-refund-2019-are-you-winning-or-losing-under-the-new-tax-law-heres-how-to-tell/", "text": "Some Americans are getting an unwelcome surprise this tax season, with refunds down about 9 percent so far this year. Getting less money back, not to mention having to write a check to the IRS, can sting, especially if a taxpayer was expecting the usual windfall.\n\nEven tax experts are getting slammed by the tax changes. \"One of my accountants came to me just before, she did her taxes this year and owes $7,000. This is definitely real,\" said Jonathan Medows, manager partner at Medows CPA. Asked what he told his accountant, he said, \"There's nothing they can do. They owe money.\"\n\nSuch anecdotes are sparking debate over whether the new tax law, officially known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and which took effect last year, is delivering the benefits that President Donald Trump and other Republican lawmakers promised.\n\n\"The tax code picks winners and losers, and there are going to be winners and losers as people file their tax returns,\" Dan Geltrude, founder of accounting firm Geltrude and Co., told CBS News.\n\nSmaller refund this year? Wrong yardstick\n\nFirst, it's important to note that while taxpayers often fixate on the size of their refunds, that's not an accurate yardstick of whether the new tax regulations are helping or hurting you, experts say.\n\n\"If you are assessing whether you came out ahead or not solely of the size of your refund, that is the wrong way to go about this,\" said Nick Holeman, a certified financial planner at investment company Betterment. \"The size of the refund is only part of the picture.\"\n\nA puny refund or even an unexpected bill don't necessarily indicate a taxpayer has been hard-hit by the new tax laws. Holeman said he himself aims to come out even at tax time, neither owing nor being owed money by the IRS.\n\n\"i personally think [it is] a great thing\" that refunds are lower this year, he said. \"You don't want to give an interest-free loan to the government unless you absolutely have to.\"\n\nA better metric\n\nThe key to figuring out whether you're coming out ahead under the new tax bill isn't the size of your refund, but what's known as your effective tax rate, Holeman said.\n\nThe effective tax rate is a percentage that explains how much of your income was paid in taxes. It's not the same as your marginal tax rate, which represents the taxes paid on each dollar earned above a particular tax bracket. For instance, the IRS taxes the lowest amount of income at the lowest tax rate, and then increases rates as a person's income rises.\n\nThat means a person's highest marginal rate could be 37 percent -- the highest individual rate under the new tax law -- but their effective rate is usually much lower.\n\n\"If that effective tax rate went down, you are better off -- even if your refund went down,\" Holeman said.\n\nWhat's behind lower tax refunds?\n\nHow to calculate your effective tax rate\n\nFirst, you'll need to calculate your effective tax rate for 2017. That can be determined by finding your total income on line 22 of your IRS Form 1040 from last year. Then look on on page 2, line 63, which provides your total tax. Divide your total tax amount by total income and you'll determine your effective tax rate.\n\nThe Form 1040 for this year's tax season has a slightly different format. Total income will be listed on line 6, and total tax is on line 15. Do the same calculation to determine your effective tax rate under the new law.\n\nSome taxpayers may have a lower effective rate, but are receiving smaller refunds because they either didn't adjust their withholding or their employers already paid more into their paychecks, tax experts said.\n\n\"I have one client, their effective tax rate went down by 9 percent, but their refund went down,\" Medows said. \"My classic client is making income of about $120,000, and their tax rate came down but the withholding wasn't the same.

It cited the company's U.S. recall of 675,000 cases -- or 13.5 million cans -- in presenting its case as a class action, filed on behalf of a group of people.\n\n\"We believe that hundreds, if not thousands, of pets have died or become seriously ill as a result of eating Hill's foods with toxic levels of vitamin D,\" emailed Nyran Rose Rasche, a Chicago-based attorney with Cafferty Clobes Meriwether & Sprengel, which filed the class action.\n\nThe suit is among a handful filed since Hill's late-January recall, which soon found the company awash in complaints from grief-stricken dog owners, many of whom took to social media to relay stories of their pet's demise.\n\n\"We have received an outpouring of distressing calls and emails from dog owners whose dogs died after eating the recalled products,\" emailed Kathryn Schubert, an attorney with Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe in San Francisco, which has filed two class actions. \"Their stories are heartbreaking.\"\n\nPlease look for dog food recalls.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration told CBS MoneyWatch in early February that nine companies that have issued recalls for dry food share a common contract manufacturer, and it noted that one brand had cited a \"formulation error.\" The FDA hasn't identified that source, but several companies said the recalled dry food was produced by Sunshine Mills, which issued its own recall in late November. Sunshine Mills hasn't immediately responded to a CBS MoneyWatch request for comment.\n\nThe FDA's investigations of these two incidents -- Hill's canned-food recall and nine others involving dry food with excessive vitamin D -- \"revealed no connection between the firms' sources of vitamin D,\" the agency emailed Wednesday.\n\n\"Heart broken\" over the issue\n\n\n\nIn its recall, Hill's, which is owned by global consumer products company Colgate-Palmolive, said it had \"identified and isolated the supplier error\" that involved a specific vitamin mix. It also described itself as \"heart broken\" over the issue in a message to pet owners posted on its website. \"We are not aware of any link to any earlier product recall,\" a Hill's spokesperson emailed CBS MoneyWatch earlier this month.\n\nAttorneys representing deceased dog owners presented a different view in their legal filings. \"In December 2018 several other brands of dog food were recalled due to toxic levels of vitamin D found in those products, and dogs eating Hill's Specialty Dog Foods began dying of vitamin D toxicity well before that,\" said the New York suit.\n\n\"The lethal nature of Hill's Specialty Dog Foods has been compounded by Hill's excessive and unwarranted delay in warning consumers and regulatory agencies of the dangers posed by these products and caused untold numbers of pet owners significant emotional distress and financial loss,\" noted the court filing, which detailed the cases of three bereaved dog owners.\n\n\"As early as February of 2018, dog owners began to complain that Hill's Specialty Dog Foods were causing their pets to display symptoms consistent with vitamin D poisoning, such as 'daily diarrhea, excessive thirst and constant food begging,'\" according to the suit.\n\nHowever, Hill's disputes the notion that it delayed warning consumers. A spokesperson emailed CBS MoneyWatch that the company monitors consumer complaints and \"saw no trends beginning in February 2018 that would alert us to an issue that any product contained excess vitamin D.\"\n\nThe FDA has received \"a number of reports\" since Hill's recall and is in the process of verifying the complaints. \"It would be premature to release a number until the cases have been vetted to ensure they are all related to recalled product and are indeed cases of vitamin D toxicity,\" an agency spokesperson emailed Wednesday.\n\nAdditional lawsuits\n\n\n\nOther suits filed against Hill's this month include a complaint on behalf of a Florida couple who allege their rescue dog, a dachshund named Stella, was poisoned by the high levels of vitamin D in Hill's food and was subsequently euthanized on Jan. 26, just days days before Hill's issued its recall.\n\nLaw firm Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe also said it filed a class action in San Francisco this month against Hill's for selling dog food containing excessive and dangerous amounts of vitamin D.\n\nHill's recall extends beyond the U.S. Its recall posted by the FDA states that \"impacted products outside the United States will be subject to separate notices on the country-specific website.\" It advised consumers outside the U.S. to check their own country's Hill's website for more information.\n\nUsing information from Hill's websites around the world, eFoodAlert posted a list of recalled products and batch codes, sorted by country, of which at least 26 are outside the U.S.\n\nAccording to Food Safety News, recalled products were sold in Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K.\n\nHill's confirmed some of the recalled product was shipped overseas, noting that the exported cans represented about 20 percent of the total cans affected and that a majority of recalled cans were recovered before reaching consumers."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-tax-refund-2019-americans-shocked-by-impact-of-new-tax-law/", "text": "Wait, I owe the IRS?\n\nThe first tax filing season under the new federal tax law is proving to be surprising, confusing \u2014 and occasionally frightening \u2014 for some Americans, especially those accustomed to getting money back from the government.\n\nTake Andy Kraft and Amy Elias of Portland, Oregon. The couple had grown comfortable getting a small refund each year, a few hundred dollars or more. Then they found out they owe $10,160 this year.\n\n\"I will never forget the moment, I thought 'We look good' and then we added in the next W-2 and my jaw hit the floor,\" Kraft said. \"There was no way I wanted to believe that what I was looking at was accurate.\"\n\nPresident Trump promised a reduction in taxes with the new law. And by most measures, the majority of Americans will see one. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center projected the tax law would reduce individual income taxes by about $1,260 on average, although it benefits higher earners more. But not everyone is benefiting, including some taxpayers who failed to adjust their withholding.\n\nThe IRS has encouraged people to do a \"paycheck checkup,\" saying that \"some taxpayers might prefer to have less tax withheld up front and receive more in their paychecks.\" The trouble is, few Americans seem to have done that.\n\nWhy you may get a smaller tax refund this year\n\nThe majority of workers didn't bother to change their withholding, according to payroll processing firm ADP.\n\n\"Not many people took the time or trouble to see if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act affects them personally,\" Pete Isberg, ADP's head of government relations, recently told CBS News.\n\nFewer deductions\n\nSome people already saw the benefit in the form of bigger paychecks. That's because the law forced employers to change what they withheld. But the system is far from perfect, and many workers didn't have enough in taxes set aside. Now, the IRS wants that money.\n\nIn addition, the law also eliminated personal exemptions, increased child credits, limited popular deductions and generally upended many familiar practices that determine what happens at tax time. That has taxpayers feeling a bit unmoored.\n\n\"We were very comfortable with our tax law, it had basically been there since 1986, suddenly all these things that were very important to people changed ... it's all different,\" said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\n\"Grief of acceptance\"\n\nKraft and Elias are able to pay their tax bill but he's still stunned. He even tried to reverse-engineer things to figure out where they went wrong, diving into page after page of IRS rules. He painstakingly put together all the numbers. The couple ultimately asked a CPA to verify the figures they were seeing on TurboTax. Crushingly, they were correct.\n\nThe couple's effective tax rate was lower, but they still owed the government.\n\n\"I feel like I have reached a stage of grief of acceptance,\" he said. \"In a twisted way I should have been paying this all year and now I just have to pay it in one lump sum.\"\n\nA number of experts such as Gleckman are urging taxpayers to obsess less about their refund or what they owe when measuring the effect of the new tax law. These are just a sliver of your tax picture.\n\nBut the truth is, many Americans have come to rely on refunds. About three-quarters of U.S. taxpayers typically get one and they had averaged around $2,800. For some low-income households it is the biggest cash infusion of the year.\n\nFewer refunds\n\nThe IRS reported Thursday that the average tax refund as of the second week of filing season was $1,949, down 8.7 percent from the year earlier. The total number of refunds is down 16 percent.\n\nExperts caution it is too early to draw conclusions about a tax season that ends in April. Plus, the number of returns \u2014 27 million as of Feb. 8 \u2014 is down 10 percent from a year ago, due in part to the partial government shutdown. The picture will become much clearer as more filings are processed, refunds are issued and the IRS gets back up to full speed.\n\nAll the same, the initial results have surprised early filers and worried those who haven't yet tackled their taxes.\n\nPart of the problem centers around how employees and employers adjusted (or didn't adjust) withholdings from paychecks to account for the law's changes. The government issued updated withholding guidelines to help employers determine how much to set aside from an employee's paycheck to cover taxes. Withhold too much and you get a refund at tax time; too little and you owe.\n\nIt is at best, an estimate. But it's an estimate that grew drastically more difficult to make under the new law.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office estimated in a report last summer that about 30 million workers had too little withheld from their paychecks, which made their take home pay bigger but increased their tax liability. That's about 3 million more workers than normal.\n\nFew taxpayers appear to have heeded the IRS' advice to do a \"paycheck checkup\" to make sure they had the proper amount withheld. Payroll processor ADP, which is responsible for paying one out of every six Americans, said the vast majority of people in its system didn't update their withholdings last year.\n\nMore surprises\n\nSome taxpayers who did make adjustments found they couldn't get it quite right.\n\nKevin McCreanor of Milton, Georgia and his wife normally get a sizeable refund each year \u2014 it was more than $12,000 last year. While they know waiting for a large refund isn't the best strategy financially, they like a refund and they put anything they get back toward their daughters' education. Their income, earned primarily from his wife's job in telecom, can vary greatly, so there was comfort in never facing a big bill.\n\nThe couple increased her paycheck withholdings to ensure the same but found they are only getting back $519 this year. Their income and tax rate did increase, and McCreanor acknowledges there is probably more he could have done to prepare but he is very disappointed all the same.\n\nSome surprises were welcome, however. Brian Goodell and his wife typically face a tax bill of anywhere from $10,000 to $15,000 each year. But this year the Tigard, Oregon, couple is getting a $15,000 refund. They believe they got some benefit from the increased child tax credit. They also made more charitable donations and increased their withholdings. While Goodell isn't entirely sure why it worked out so well, he'll gladly take the refund.\n\nTaxpayers can get a better sense of how they fared by looking at their tax liability or effective tax rate. This information is often available on the summary received from an accountant or tax preparation software. They can also look at the \"total tax\" on those summaries or form 1040. These are not perfect measures either, but provide some perspective.\n\nBreaking even\n\nAnd remember that getting a refund is not necessarily a good thing. Breaking even is really the best outcome from an economic point of view.

People's lives change in ways that can dramatically influence their taxes, such as marriages, divorces, kids, moving or job changes.

But Catlin, who has cerebral palsy, fears he'll soon be out of work after the store manager told him his job description was changing\u2014and would now include tasks he's physically unable to do.\n\n\"It was a shock,\" Catlin, 30, said Wednesday in a phone interview. \"I never saw it coming.\"\n\nNeither did Catlin's family. They say that Walmart is acting heartlessly toward one of its most dedicated workers. Walmart says it's hoping to keep him in the store.\n\nCatlin has served in the traditional \"people greeter\" role for the past 10 years after graduating from high school. But at many Walmart locations, the job has been morphing into that of \"customer host\" since 2016, and those workers are now responsible for helping with returns, checking receipts to help prevent shoplifting, and keeping the front of the store clean.\n\nCatlin, who uses a walker and is legally blind, said he was told by store management that, come late April, he'd need to be able to lift at least 25 pounds, stand for long periods of time, write reports and read receipts in order to be able to stay on as a customer host.\n\n\"I wouldn't be able to,\" he said.\n\nCatlin's plight became public after his mother, Holly Catlin, wrote about it on Facebook on Monday night. Her post has been shared thousands of times, with longtime customers and strangers alike expressing outrage at the retailer.\n\nFirst of all, I will say these are my own words and not Adam's. He has no idea that I am posting this. I am extremely... Posted by Holly Catlin on Monday, February 18, 2019\n\nSome have even come forward with GoFundMe plans, raffle ideas and benefits, but Holly and her family have refused donations in a Facebook post, saying that Catlin's situation isn't putting a financial strain on their family.\n\n\"If they're going to give money we'd rather have them save it for someone who has financial need. We'd like them to give it to someone who really could use it instead of us,\" Adam's sister, Amber Piermattei, said.\n\nCatlin's middle sister also died from a heart attack just six weeks ago in late December, Piermattei said, making this a tough time for the family.\n\nCatlin works about eight hours a day, 32 hours a week at the location. He is so associated with the Selinsgrove Walmart that he cut the ribbon at the store's grand reopening and is often recognized when he's out and about.\n\n\"Everybody loves him. He just lights up the whole place like a full moon,\" said Walmart shopper Ellen English, 51. \"They can't do that to Adam.\"\n\nWalmart spokesman Kory Lundberg called Catlin a \"valued member of the team and part of what makes our Selinsgrove store special.\" In a statement Wednesday, he said Walmart is \"looking for a solution that keeps him in the store.\"\n\nAdam Catlin has worked as a \"people greeter\" at a Walmart store in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, for roughly a decade. With permission from Holly Catlin\n\nUnder federal law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to workers with disabilities. The law requires an \"interactive process\" between employer and employee to evaluate requests to be accommodated. Caitlin's family said a Walmart store manager, a human relations manager and an official at corporate headquarters called Wednesday afternoon to discuss the situation. However, Catlin's sister Piermattei said that they didn't have any suggestions for how to move forward.\n\n\"This job is his main thing in his life, it's his driving force, it's his heart,\" said Piermattei. \"It just gives him self-worth to get up and punch that clock like everybody else and be in the community... He's dedicated to this place, and for them to just sweep him out the door because he has different abilities, I think, is a disgrace.\"\n\n\"I just want my job back\"\n\nCatlin isn't the first Walmart greeter with a disability to be impacted by the changeover to customer host. In 2016, Danny Ockenhouse, who uses a wheelchair, said he lost his greeter's role at a Walmart in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, because he couldn't keep up with the newly physical demands of the job.\n\n\"I just want my job back, and I want to be appreciated,\" Ockenhouse, who'd worked there 21 years, said at the time. He wound up getting a severance package.\n\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, meanwhile, has filed numerous lawsuits against Walmart over the years over its treatment of workers with disabilities. Walmart has said it doesn't tolerate discrimination.\n\nPiermattei said her brother loves his job so much that he doesn't like to take paid vacation \u2014 to Catlin, it's cheating the company. After having a heart attack a few years back, Catlin told the doctors in the ICU that he needed to be released from the hospital by morning so he could make it to work. Piermattei said that her brother is still working his shift this week.\n\n\"What I want is to be the greeter, and to be able to sit down and do my job,\" Catlin said. \"I hope everything works out.\""}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-make-money-in-the-stock-market-over-time/", "text": "Take it from Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world and the most successful investor of all time: When the stock market careens around like a roller coaster that's jumped the track, stay cool.\n\nIn other words, average investors don't need to obsess over every twist and turn in the market, let alone hit the panic button when their 401(k) plan holdings lose value as volatility flares. That doesn't mean ignoring your portfolio, of course--as usual in financial matters--it pays to remain attentive. But it does mean laying out your money goals for the long-term and periodically adjusting your investment strategy.\n\n\"Forget your passwords--every quarter you definitely need to look at your portfolio and manage and assess what your risk tolerance is and look at your long-term goals and see if your long-term goals are matching what your risk tolerance is,\" said Jeanie Ahn, senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe upshot: Being a savvy investor almost always means keeping it simple. Ask yourself (or a trusted financial adviser) what those longer-term financial goals are and if what's happening in the stock market at any given time affects them. A change in your financial needs and priorities might require a shift in your investment strategy.\n\nConsider your financial goals\n\nIt's important to consider where and how you plan to spend your money when deciding how much of it to invest in the stock market, Ahn said. \"Are you going to be buying a home shortly? Do you need money for a down payment? Do you need funds for your small business? Things like that, you definitely shouldn't have the majority of your funds in the market.\"\n\nMajor life changes, like impending retirement, also may warrant a shakeup in your investment approach, as your financial goals shift. Meanwhile, be guided be common sense, and don't put all your eggs in one basket. In other words, keep a diverse portfolio.\n\n\"You shouldn't pick one, two, three stocks. You should make sure it is in a variety of different places,\" Ahn said.\n\nTime is on your side\n\nThe bottom line? Invest for the long run, and look past the market's often bewildering daily gyrations. Don't try to beat the stock market -- especially at a time when computerized trading sends stocks rocketing up and down in mysterious ways -- but rather know how to make it your friend.\n\n\"Over time, on average, your money will grow about eight to 10 percent year-over-year in the S&P,\" Ahn said. \"So if that is the case, then time is on your side.

Some have gone up by as much as almost 100 percent, forcing people to move, stay with friends or even live in their vehicles.\n\nThe town of Medford recently authorized churches to offer car camping for the homeless on their parking lots. Cities across the West Coast are struggling with soaring housing prices and a growing homelessness problem.\n\nA House committee on Wednesday backed the measure, sending it to the full chamber for a vote as soon as next week. The Senate passed it last week, and Gov. Kate Brown has said she will endorse it.\n\nChurches are helping solve the affordable housing crisis\n\n\"We've waited too long as it is, and there are too many people living in tents. It is an emergency,\" said Rep. Tawna Sanchez, a Portland Democrat and member of the House Committee of Services and Housing that endorsed the legislation.\n\nThe housing shortage is getting worse as people keep moving to Oregon, drawn by its forests, mountains, coastline, relaxed lifestyle and job opportunities. Oregon ranked second to Vermont as the top moving destination in 2018, according to a study by United Van Lines, the nation's largest household goods mover.\n\n\"No boundaries\"\n\n\n\nLawmakers noted Oregon will be a pioneer in statewide rent control if the measure becomes law. New York has a statewide rent control law but cities choose whether to participate.\n\nCalifornia actually restricts the ability of cities to impose rent control. Last November, voters defeated a ballot initiative that would have overturned that law.\n\n\"Homelessness and affordability have no boundaries,\" said Rep. Mark Meek, a Democrat from a Portland suburb. \"We're going to be leading the nation now with this legislation.\"\n\nOregon's measure prohibits landlords from terminating month-to-month leases without cause after 12 months of occupancy and limits rent hikes to once per year. Those increases are limited to 7 percent above the annual change in the consumer price index.\n\nLandlords can terminate tenancies only with 90 days' written notice and payment of one month's rent, with exemptions in some cases. A landlord can refuse to renew a fixed-term lease if the tenant receives three lease violation warnings within 12 months and the landlord gives 90 days' notice.\n\nThe Oregon Rental Housing Association said the measure protects good tenants while not encouraging landlords to leave the business and invest their money elsewhere.\n\n\"I believe most landlords will be able to adapt and operate within the parameters,\" said Jim Straub, the group's legislative director.\n\nRent or buy: Which is best in your city?\n\nEric Lint, who lives in the popular mountain town of Bend, urged lawmakers to pass the protections because rents are skyrocketing. The medical lab where Lint works is chronically understaffed because potential hires say there is a lack of affordable housing.\n\nLint's hourly pay has risen 8 percent over five years. Meanwhile, his rent has increased 66 percent. He plans to move away in the fall.\n\nAnna Pe\u00f1a, a senior at the University of Oregon in Eugene who works full-time, described living in a house smaller than 1,200 square feet with five roommates and spending over half her income on rent that then increased by 15 percent.\n\n\"Ultimately, housing insecurity has been one of the biggest setbacks for my education and personal health,\" she said.\n\nSen. Tim Knopp, a Republican from Bend, said before he voted against the measure last week that it doesn't address the housing supply issue.\n\nAnother measure does. It would require cities and counties to allow duplexes and some higher-density housing in land zoned for single-family homes.\n\nHouse Speaker Tina Kotek said 30,000 housing units must be built per year to meet the current deficit and to build for the future as more people move to Oregon.\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/smallhold-wants-automated-in-store-farms-to-change-how-we-eat/", "text": "Andrew Carter and Adam DeMartino want to revolutionize the way we eat by installing compact farms in restaurants and grocery stores across the country. Their goal is to distribute fresh produce on-site and at scale.\n\nCognizant of the physical limitations of traditional farming, the former college roommates married their backgrounds in indoor agriculture and business to find a way to make farming infinitely scalable, accessible and affordable. The answer? Smallhold, New York City's first and only remotely operated mushroom farm.\n\nFounded in 2017, Smallhold places proprietary mini-farms in restaurants and grocery stores, allowing subscribers to grow fresh produce in their aisles or kitchens and deliver it directly to customers.\n\nNo farming knowledge is required -- the company operates the units using remote technology.\n\nA farm in your grocery store\n\nThe mini-farms -- which have been shrunk to the size of a shelving unit -- produce between 20 and 120 pounds of mushrooms per week, allowing growers to pay for the system by selling excess produce to other businesses.\n\n\"When we went into this, we didn't want to just start a mushroom farm, we wanted to start a farm that impacted people's eating habits and was inherently a business that took care of the things around it,\" Carter told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We can provide the unit and service to someone who isn't even near us, and they can create their own business out of it.\"\n\nSmallhold's system grows produce that is traceable -- and also \"literally, the best quality mushroom you can get,\" according to DeMartino.\n\nIt's true that tasting produce harvested minutes earlier can be life-changing, and Smallhold is also shifting the nature of distribution and consumption.\n\n\"Most people receive food three, four days if not weeks, after it's harvested. And once someone tastes something that's been harvested within hours, it's just a whole different experience for them,\" Carter said.\n\n\"Produce can be harvested right there and then put right on the shelf for anyone to enjoy -- and cook right there,\" he added.\n\nMushrooms instead of meat\n\n\n\nMushrooms were a natural stating point for Smallhold, according to the founders, who recognized the fungi's growing popularity as an alternative to meat.\n\n\"There is an increase in demand for local and hyper-local food, and we couldn't really find anyone trying to do mushrooms,\" Carter said. \"At the same time, there was this massive increase in food as medicine and using mushrooms as a replacement for meat.\"\n\nThey're not stopping at mushrooms, though. The duo plans on scanning store aisles to swap out dead vegetables for farm-fresh goods.\n\n\"We have literally the technology to farm inside of a grocery store. Why wouldn't we just start slowly moving up the produce aisle, letting people harvest fresh produce, timing that appropriately?\" DeMartino said.\n\nWhole Foods and Bunker Vietnamese in Brooklyn, and Mission Chinese Food in Manhattan each have their own Smallhold mushroom farms -- and many more installations are planned.

With the 2019 models due to arrive in late September, automakers and dealers are eager to clear out the 2018 models. The result is a kaleidoscope of cash-back rebates, low-interest loans and attractive lease deals. And of course, you may well get discounts beyond the rebate. The best approach is to negotiate a price with the salesperson then apply the rebate -- not the other way around. However, buying in July and August also has some drawbacks. You have to be flexible about what color car you want. And the exact package of options you prefer may not be available. But if you're OK with that, you can get one of the best options of all: bragging to your friends and neighbors about what a great deal you got. To give you a range of choices, we looked at the details on discount purchase deals, plus low-payment lease deals on two SUVs, one pickup, one mainstream sedan and one luxury model. Read on for a look at five of the best current deals on new cars.\n\nBuick Encore Buick This subcompact SUV is offering a rare double: zero percent financing plus cash back. Usually you must choose one or the other. The rebate is for $1,750, and the zero percent loan runs for six years. If you prefer leasing, the deal is $159 a month for 24 months with $4,319 due at signing. Reviewers like the Encore for its nimble handling as well as its comfortable cabin and easy-to-use infotainment system. And the Encore has an excellent record of reliability. The original list prices before negotiations and rebate run from $22,900 to $32,100.\n\nChrysler 300 Chrysler If a big, flashy, powerful car suits your taste, Chrysler 300 comes with rebates that range from $6,000 to $7,000 depending on where you live. The 300 isn't offering a promotional lease deal just now. Reviewers like the 300 as a comfortable highway cruiser with plenty of punch if you need to pass -- especially with the optional 363-horsepower V-8. The list prices before negotiations and rebates range from $28,995 to $40,995.\n\nSubaru Outback Subaru The Outback comes with zero percent financing if your credit rating is good enough to qualify. Perhaps the best deal here is the lease at $269 per month for three years. The $1,769 due at signing is less than half the lease down payment being asked on other models. The Outback falls on the border between wagon and SUV. Whatever you call it, reviewers like its comfortable seats and capacious cargo space. New for 2018, its infotainment system works with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto -- enabling you to easily play music from your smartphone through the car speakers. Outback original list prices run from $25,895 to $38,960.\n\nGMC Sierra GMC Despite strong overall pickup sales, General Motors is offering $2,500 cash back on the Sierra. The lease offering is for $199 a month for two years. Reviewers praise the Sierra for its robust towing capability and strong safety rating as well as spacious front seats. As is typical with pickups, Sierra list prices cover an enormous range from $29,000 to $56,300."}, {"source": "cbs", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/media/6-of-the-safest-cars-on-the-road/", "text": "Lexus\n\nTo buy a safe car, you want to know that it can hold up well in crashes.

And to focus on the dangers of substandard headlights, superior performance in this category has also been added to the necessary hurdles.\n\nIIHS recently updated its crash-test requirements. A new test measures occupant protection simulating an accident where one corner of the vehicle on the passenger side hits a tree or light pole.\n\nThe six vehicles given top safety pick plus status so far in 2018 scored well in this passenger-side test in addition to tests for a similar collision on the driver side, plus front, side and rollover crashes. Vehicles that meet all other criteria but have not passed the passenger-side test get a ranking of \"top safety pick\" minus the plus.\n\nLet's have a closer look at the six latest top safety pick plus winners announced so far this year. In some cases, the advanced crash avoidance technology is optional and only versions of a car with those options qualify for the top award."}]
