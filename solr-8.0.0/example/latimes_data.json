A prestigious musician, a classical trombonist named Alejandro Zamora, was coming from Mexico City to this town of indigenous Mixteco people.\n\nThe mayor, Alejandro Aparicio, persuaded Zamora to start a band at the Casa de la Cultura, a vibrant cultural center run by the city. Zamora, then 34, agreed under one condition: He wanted to launch a symphonic band with only children, each one starting from scratch.\n\n\u201cI had this vision in my mind, and the kids in Tlaxiaco seemed to have all the potential,\u201d Zamora said.\n\nEl Profesor was unlike anything folks in town had ever seen. He was demanding, pushy and passionate, with expectations for recognition that would stretch far beyond the mountain.\n\n\u201cLeave no room for error,\u201d he constantly told his 65-piece band.\n\nKids, ages 5 to 17, rehearsed two hours a day, seven days a week. Sometimes they rehearsed twice in one day.\n\n\u201cOne of my sons cried the first few days,\u201d said Ewdiuviel Lopez, 45. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018Papa, the profesor yells too much.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut in time, Lopez said, his three boys learned to appreciate their teacher. They grew attached to their clarinet, saxophone and snare drums.\n\nZamora taught his students, all Mixtecos like Yalitza, to master dozens of Mexican and Latin American compositions \u2014 sones, jarabes, chilenas and fandangos. These were high-energy pieces with rapid, twisting melodies, complicated rhythms and leaping crescendos.\n\nAlejandro Zamora warms up La Banda Sinf\u00f3nica de Tlaxiaco.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) More Photos\n\nHe put the tiniest kids, or those missing teeth, on percussion. The rest played other instruments, such as flutes and clarinets, trumpets and saxophones.\n\nAt every rehearsal, the conductor stood front and center, slicing the air with his hands and watching each protege like a hawk, sometimes addressing them with the endearment my daughter, my son:\n\nValeria, mija, you have to catch up!\n\nChristian, you\u2019re running too much.\n\nWatch your notes, Diana.\n\nFeel the impulse everyone. Eso! Let\u2019s go.\n\n'I had this vision in my mind, and the kids in Tlaxiaco seemed to have all the potential.' Alejandro Zamora\n\nTwo years in, the Banda Sinf\u00f3nica de Tlaxiaco had gained regional acclaim. Tlaxiaque\u00f1os talked about the kids at the market, at church and school. Turning the band\u2019s name into an acronym, they constantly spoke of \u201cBASIT.\u201d Have you heard BASIT? they\u2019d ask. They booked the band for their fiestas, weddings and funerals.\n\n\u201cWe would go everywhere and put on our best show,\u201d said band parent Jesus Montes Bautista.\n\nThose with deep roots in Tlaxiaco like to talk about the days before the Mexican Revolution, when their pueblo was famous for craftsmen who turned out fine furniture, shoes and saddlery. Dealers on mules used to trek up the mountain to buy goods in bulk.\n\nSome Tlaxiaque\u00f1os grew quite wealthy. They vacationed in France and returned to the town square, or zocalo, in puffy, flounced dresses, penguin coat tails and silk gloves. People all over began to call the town El Paris Chiquito, the Little Paris.\n\n'Roma's' Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n shows us the Mexico City streets that shaped his Oscar-nominated film \u00bb\n\nYears later, during the revolution, rioters ran nearly all those folks out of town.\n\nToday, few relics remain from that era beyond Tlaxiaco\u2019s historic clock tower. Chippy and faded, it stands over the zocalo, where vendors peddle used clothes and chanclas as cumbias play, toddlers cry and women in aprons yell, \u201cPapayas! Papayas!\u201d\n\nThe town core has about 17,000 people, with thousands more, like Yalitza\u2019s family, in the outskirts. Many residents, most of all the indigenous families, lack the most basic necessities. They work menial jobs or survive off the land.\n\nBut ask Tlaxiaque\u00f1os what they\u2019re most proud of and they\u2019ll talk about their town\u2019s love of culture and the arts. Every season, at least 600 kids flock to the Casa de la Cultura to take classes in acting, painting, dance and music.\n\nJust as the band\u2019s fame was spreading, a new mayor in 2017 took hold of Tlaxiaco. \u201cYou could say this man was not a big fan of the arts,\u201d said Miguel Martinez Oseguera, director of the Casa de la Cultura.\n\nThen-Mayor Oscar Ramirez Bola\u00f1os cut many programs at the Casa and slashed Zamora\u2019s pay 80%, to $57 a week. Two of his assistants were let go. The third left as well over a pay cut. Parents began buying Zamora rice, beans and bags of tamales.\n\nThe worst insult came in 2018, when the mayor forbid the kids from trying out for Oaxaca\u2019s internationally renowned fiesta, La Guelaguetza. He formed his own band instead, hand selecting what he considered the best teenage musicians of Tlaxiaco. But those candidates didn\u2019t make it past the selection committee, and for only the second time in nearly 30 years Tlaxiaco was shut out of the festival.\n\nThe town, Martinez Oseguera said, was shocked and furious.\n\nStudents participate in a dance class at a preschool in Tlaxiaco, Mexico.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) More Photos\n\nOn a recent afternoon, the fourth-generation Tlaxiaque\u00f1o sat behind his desk at the Casa, took a deep breath and scratched his bald head as he recounted the drama.\n\nHe had faced plenty of strife running the Casa for decades. But the mayor\u2019s actions, like most Mexican politics, left him helpless and baffled. Was the cause creative differences? Budget woes? Bad tempers? He\u2019s not entirely sure, and Ramirez Bola\u00f1os has since left town and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nLast summer, as the band\u2019s survival hung by a thread, the kids got what felt like a miracle. A man running for president campaigned in Tlaxiaco and heard them perform.\n\nDays later, his people surprised Zamora with a phone call. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador asked the kids to play at his final campaign rally, before 100,000 people. After he won, he also picked them, from thousands of bands, to perform at his inauguration.\n\nAsk Tlaxiaque\u00f1os what they\u2019re most proud of and they\u2019ll talk about their town\u2019s love of culture and the arts.\n\nThe band made national news. Zamora was overjoyed. Most of all, relieved. Mayor Ramirez Bola\u00f1os was about to term out and his successor was Alejandro Aparicio, the former mayor who had persuaded Zamora to start the band in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe made it,\u201d he told the kids. \u201cThe dark days are over.\u201d\n\nAparicio promised Zamora to restore his pay. He vowed to help him open a music university in Tlaxiaco so indigenous kids from all over could feel part of the band.\n\nBut the promise was short-lived. On Jan. 1, about an hour after Aparicio took office, a former police officer from northern Mexico rushed up to the mayor and shot him twice \u2014 once in the back, once in the chest. Officials continue to investigate the motive for the killing.\n\nAt his funeral, the band he so cherished somberly lined up at his casket and played all of his favorite songs.\n\nThese days, everything at the Casa de la Cultura is on hold until a new mayor takes charge. No one knows whether the next person will make things right.\n\nMeanwhile, every day, it seems, camera crews arrive in Tlaxiaco eager to tell the story of Yalitza. They go to her shanty in search of her sister, her mother, her brothers \u2014 but the family avoids all attention.\n\nSo one by one, reporters end up at the Casa, where Yalitza once took dance and painting classes. Where she held her fateful audition.\n\nMembers of Ballet Folklorico Son Mixteco wait to perform at the Casa de la Cultura in Tlaxiaco. Yalitza Aparicio, star of the movie \"Roma,\" had her audition at the center. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times\n\nIt was here, three years ago, where Martinez Oseguera helped \u201cRoma\u2019s\u201d crew hold a casting call for young women. Yalitza, a quiet student with no acting experience, came to keep her sister company and was persuaded to try out at the last minute.\n\nThe kids in the banda know the tale by heart. Martinez Oseguera likes to share it \u201cevery single day,\u201d Zamora said, laughing.\n\nWhen \u201cLa Yalitza\u201d comes up at band practice, their professor offers sage advice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful story,\u201d he tells them. \u201cBut that\u2019s like winning the lottery. What matters most in life is discipline and hard work.\u201d\n\n\u2018Roma\u2019 star Yalitza Aparicio is more than her Oscar fairy tale \u00bb\n\nOn a recent Sunday the kids were full of jitters. They took deep breaths, wiped tiny beads of sweat off their foreheads and tuned their instruments over and over. A guest of honor \u2014 the head of Oaxaca\u2019s Office of Art and Culture \u2014 was expected to walk through the Casa\u2019s door any minute.\n\nZamora and Martinez Oseguera were certain the frenzy over Yalitza had compelled this powerful woman, with little notice, to trek three hours from the state capital, Oaxaca City.\n\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s impossible to get attention from any of these people,\u201d Zamora said.\n\nThe band was determined to leave her impressed. The survival of the band was at stake. Maybe, they hoped, this visitor could open the door to this year\u2019s La Guelaguetza or perhaps assist with some funding.\n\nZamora stood in front of his band, arms akimbo.\n\n\u201cAtenci\u00f3n!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI want this to be impeccable. I want this to be nothing less than perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cSi, profe!\u201d his students answered.\n\nWhen the lady walked in with her long white huipil dress and gold folkloric earrings, the kids reached for their instruments and put on their best show.\n\nBehind the story: On location in Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca \u00bb\n\nBand members after a recent performance.

A prestigious musician, a classical trombonist named Alejandro Zamora, was coming from Mexico City to this town of indigenous Mixteco people.\n\nThe mayor, Alejandro Aparicio, persuaded Zamora to start a band at the Casa de la Cultura, a vibrant cultural center run by the city. Zamora, then 34, agreed under one condition: He wanted to launch a symphonic band with only children, each one starting from scratch.\n\n\u201cI had this vision in my mind, and the kids in Tlaxiaco seemed to have all the potential,\u201d Zamora said.\n\nEl Profesor was unlike anything folks in town had ever seen. He was demanding, pushy and passionate, with expectations for recognition that would stretch far beyond the mountain.\n\n\u201cLeave no room for error,\u201d he constantly told his 65-piece band.\n\nKids, ages 5 to 17, rehearsed two hours a day, seven days a week. Sometimes they rehearsed twice in one day.\n\n\u201cOne of my sons cried the first few days,\u201d said Ewdiuviel Lopez, 45. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018Papa, the profesor yells too much.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut in time, Lopez said, his three boys learned to appreciate their teacher. They grew attached to their clarinet, saxophone and snare drums.\n\nZamora taught his students, all Mixtecos like Yalitza, to master dozens of Mexican and Latin American compositions \u2014 sones, jarabes, chilenas and fandangos. These were high-energy pieces with rapid, twisting melodies, complicated rhythms and leaping crescendos.\n\nAlejandro Zamora warms up La Banda Sinf\u00f3nica de Tlaxiaco.

The rest played other instruments, such as flutes and clarinets, trumpets and saxophones.\n\nAt every rehearsal, the conductor stood front and center, slicing the air with his hands and watching each protege like a hawk, sometimes addressing them with the endearment my daughter, my son:\n\nValeria, mija, you have to catch up!\n\nChristian, you\u2019re running too much.\n\nWatch your notes, Diana.\n\nFeel the impulse everyone. Eso! Let\u2019s go.\n\n'I had this vision in my mind, and the kids in Tlaxiaco seemed to have all the potential.' Alejandro Zamora\n\nTwo years in, the Banda Sinf\u00f3nica de Tlaxiaco had gained regional acclaim. Tlaxiaque\u00f1os talked about the kids at the market, at church and school. Turning the band\u2019s name into an acronym, they constantly spoke of \u201cBASIT.\u201d Have you heard BASIT? they\u2019d ask. They booked the band for their fiestas, weddings and funerals.\n\n\u201cWe would go everywhere and put on our best show,\u201d said band parent Jesus Montes Bautista.\n\nThose with deep roots in Tlaxiaco like to talk about the days before the Mexican Revolution, when their pueblo was famous for craftsmen who turned out fine furniture, shoes and saddlery. Dealers on mules used to trek up the mountain to buy goods in bulk.\n\nSome Tlaxiaque\u00f1os grew quite wealthy. They vacationed in France and returned to the town square, or zocalo, in puffy, flounced dresses, penguin coat tails and silk gloves. People all over began to call the town El Paris Chiquito, the Little Paris.\n\n'Roma's' Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n shows us the Mexico City streets that shaped his Oscar-nominated film \u00bb\n\nYears later, during the revolution, rioters ran nearly all those folks out of town.\n\nToday, few relics remain from that era beyond Tlaxiaco\u2019s historic clock tower. Chippy and faded, it stands over the zocalo, where vendors peddle used clothes and chanclas as cumbias play, toddlers cry and women in aprons yell, \u201cPapayas! Papayas!\u201d\n\nThe town core has about 17,000 people, with thousands more, like Yalitza\u2019s family, in the outskirts. Many residents, most of all the indigenous families, lack the most basic necessities. They work menial jobs or survive off the land.\n\nBut ask Tlaxiaque\u00f1os what they\u2019re most proud of and they\u2019ll talk about their town\u2019s love of culture and the arts. Every season, at least 600 kids flock to the Casa de la Cultura to take classes in acting, painting, dance and music.\n\nJust as the band\u2019s fame was spreading, a new mayor in 2017 took hold of Tlaxiaco. \u201cYou could say this man was not a big fan of the arts,\u201d said Miguel Martinez Oseguera, director of the Casa de la Cultura.\n\nThen-Mayor Oscar Ramirez Bola\u00f1os cut many programs at the Casa and slashed Zamora\u2019s pay 80%, to $57 a week. Two of his assistants were let go. The third left as well over a pay cut. Parents began buying Zamora rice, beans and bags of tamales.\n\nThe worst insult came in 2018, when the mayor forbid the kids from trying out for Oaxaca\u2019s internationally renowned fiesta, La Guelaguetza. He formed his own band instead, hand selecting what he considered the best teenage musicians of Tlaxiaco. But those candidates didn\u2019t make it past the selection committee, and for only the second time in nearly 30 years Tlaxiaco was shut out of the festival.\n\nThe town, Martinez Oseguera said, was shocked and furious.\n\nStudents participate in a dance class at a preschool in Tlaxiaco, Mexico.

But the mayor\u2019s actions, like most Mexican politics, left him helpless and baffled. Was the cause creative differences? Budget woes? Bad tempers? He\u2019s not entirely sure, and Ramirez Bola\u00f1os has since left town and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nLast summer, as the band\u2019s survival hung by a thread, the kids got what felt like a miracle. A man running for president campaigned in Tlaxiaco and heard them perform.\n\nDays later, his people surprised Zamora with a phone call. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador asked the kids to play at his final campaign rally, before 100,000 people. After he won, he also picked them, from thousands of bands, to perform at his inauguration.\n\nAsk Tlaxiaque\u00f1os what they\u2019re most proud of and they\u2019ll talk about their town\u2019s love of culture and the arts.\n\nThe band made national news. Zamora was overjoyed. Most of all, relieved. Mayor Ramirez Bola\u00f1os was about to term out and his successor was Alejandro Aparicio, the former mayor who had persuaded Zamora to start the band in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe made it,\u201d he told the kids. \u201cThe dark days are over.\u201d\n\nAparicio promised Zamora to restore his pay. He vowed to help him open a music university in Tlaxiaco so indigenous kids from all over could feel part of the band.\n\nBut the promise was short-lived. On Jan. 1, about an hour after Aparicio took office, a former police officer from northern Mexico rushed up to the mayor and shot him twice \u2014 once in the back, once in the chest. Officials continue to investigate the motive for the killing.\n\nAt his funeral, the band he so cherished somberly lined up at his casket and played all of his favorite songs.\n\nThese days, everything at the Casa de la Cultura is on hold until a new mayor takes charge. No one knows whether the next person will make things right.\n\nMeanwhile, every day, it seems, camera crews arrive in Tlaxiaco eager to tell the story of Yalitza. They go to her shanty in search of her sister, her mother, her brothers \u2014 but the family avoids all attention.\n\nSo one by one, reporters end up at the Casa, where Yalitza once took dance and painting classes.

They took deep breaths, wiped tiny beads of sweat off their foreheads and tuned their instruments over and over. A guest of honor \u2014 the head of Oaxaca\u2019s Office of Art and Culture \u2014 was expected to walk through the Casa\u2019s door any minute.\n\nZamora and Martinez Oseguera were certain the frenzy over Yalitza had compelled this powerful woman, with little notice, to trek three hours from the state capital, Oaxaca City.\n\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s impossible to get attention from any of these people,\u201d Zamora said.\n\nThe band was determined to leave her impressed. The survival of the band was at stake. Maybe, they hoped, this visitor could open the door to this year\u2019s La Guelaguetza or perhaps assist with some funding.\n\nZamora stood in front of his band, arms akimbo.\n\n\u201cAtenci\u00f3n!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI want this to be impeccable. I want this to be nothing less than perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cSi, profe!\u201d his students answered.\n\nWhen the lady walked in with her long white huipil dress and gold folkloric earrings, the kids reached for their instruments and put on their best show.\n\nBehind the story: On location in Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca \u00bb\n\nBand members after a recent performance.

(Nina Prommer/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nFirst of all, how are you feeling right now, just a few days out from the show, and what\u2019s kept you sane through the roller coaster of it all?\n\nGigliotti: Well, if you could see us, we look remarkably healthy and fresh-faced and there are no bags under our eyes. I\u2019m serious \u2014 don\u2019t laugh. Because we think the show is in good shape.\n\nAnd how did I stay sane? I didn\u2019t read any press. I still have not. And I will hold to that until 8 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nWeiss: And part of keeping sane is keeping, so to speak, your eye on the prize. At the end of the day, we\u2019re producing an entertaining and moving and flowing show \u2014 with all the changes that came along, we kept working on achieving that goal.\n\nThe first major obstacle to get over was when Kevin Hart dropped out as host. How did you pivot from there? It\u2019s been 30 years since the Oscars has had no formal host. Did you immediately see that there could be some upside to going that route?\n\nGigliotti: First of all, I\u2019m going to say this in all honesty: Glenn and I did have a conversation very early on about the possibility of going hostless, and I have notes to prove that. That goes back to the beginning of October. We did have that conversation.\n\nAnd part of the reason we had that conversation was, you know, we were entrusted with doing a three-hour show. Well, go back and look at what takes up \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean this in a bad way \u2014 but a host does eat up a fair amount of time. It\u2019s one of the reasons we had the conversation about the possibility. So after Kevin Hart, the pivot was pretty easy, because we\u2019d had the conversation already.\n\nWeiss: And it\u2019s true that it\u2019s been 30 years since the Oscars have been hostless, but other shows have done it and done it recently. It\u2019s happened on the Globes. It\u2019s happened on the Grammys. It\u2019s happened on the Tonys. And it\u2019s something that Donna and I thought was eminently doable as a potential scenario, going back to the beginning.\n\nIs there an overarching theme to the show this year \u2014 and if there is, how did you arrive at that?\n\nGigliotti: If there is a theme \u2014 and I think there is \u2014 it\u2019s about movies as an empathetic art form. Movies connect people. Movies bring people together. Movies have cultural importance. That\u2019s sort of our theme, which we take a lot from the films themselves \u2014 \u201cBlack Panther\u201d being a perfectly good example of this, where there are a lot of people who saw \u201cBlack Panther\u201d who now understand something about black culture they didn\u2019t understand before.\n\nA few days ago, you made the big announcement that Queen is performing, and there\u2019s been speculation that they\u2019ll be opening the show. What was the thinking about having them perform along with the nominated songs? There have been years when the songs haven\u2019t been performed at all. How did you arrive at the songs plus Queen?\n\nGigliotti: Glenn and I talked about Queen early on \u2014 and we can tell you that Queen are going to open the broadcast.\n\nHow did we come to that decision? Well, you have to look at the fact that this is a movie [\u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d] that has done in excess of $800 million worldwide business. Japan alone is $100 million. We are putting on a show for a worldwide audience. So Queen is kind of a natural for us. I mean, don\u2019t you want to be at rehearsals when Queen are rehearsing? It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s fantastic.\n\nWeiss: And again, adding to all the statistics Donna just quoted about the worldwide appeal, just opening the show with that kind of energy and known music and excitement allows us to start this in a different way, and we think it\u2019s really good to just jump right in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonna, at the Oscar nominees luncheon, you referenced Steven Soderbergh\u2019s acceptance speech for directing \u201cTraffic\u201d as being sort of a model of a great, pithy, emotional speech. He has since said that he thinks that\u2019s hilarious, because he was drunk and winging it because he didn\u2019t expect to win. Did you hear that he said that \u2014 and what\u2019s your reaction?\n\nGigliotti: I didn\u2019t know that. I also don\u2019t actually believe him. I think that is young Mr. Soderbergh being glib. I think that he does not really want to admit that he was very moved and that he gave a moving speech. That\u2019s what I honestly think.\n\nAnd you know what? If I think back to that year, which was 2001, I\u2019m pretty sure that you still had to pay cash at the bar. Drinks were not free. So now I doubly don\u2019t believe him, because I don\u2019t know that he had cash money in his pocket. [laughs]\n\nI\u2019ll have to go back to him now. This is going to going to be a new controversy.\n\nGigliotti: [laughs] You don\u2019t mean that, do you?\n\nNo, I\u2019m joking.\n\nGigliotti: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nOnce the decision was made to reinstate the awards for cinematography, editing, live action short and hairstyling and makeup from the commercial breaks back into the show, how much had to change and how logistically difficult was that to pull off so late in the game?\n\nWeiss: Let me start by saying this: I do a lot of live shows, as you may or may not know. The run-down is never set four weeks before the show when nominations come out. And I think part of the whole art and the process of what we do on these shows is building and changing with new information and with the times.\n\nWere some that happened this year big curveballs? Maybe. But that\u2019s kind of part of the process of building a live show. As information is coming in and pieces change, the idea is to build as exciting and as well-flowing a show as you can, and I think we kept to that. I\u2019m not sure it was an excessive curveball. It was a curveball.\n\nGigliotti: The truth is, you produce live television, you produce movies \u2014 there\u2019s always something that comes up. You deal with it, is what it amounts to.\n\nEvery year, the Oscars are scrutinized incredibly closely, and there\u2019s always a lot of armchair-quarterbacking, but given everything that\u2019s led up to this particular show, there may be even more than usual. How are you going to measure the show\u2019s success? Is it about the ratings at the end of the day or is it about something bigger and less quantifiable?\n\nGigliotti: How will we measure success? I don\u2019t know. I think ratings are one way of measuring success. I think that how my peers in the room react to the show is a measure of success. And I think that if the academy is pleased with our work, that too will be a measure of success. So it\u2019s a lot of different things.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/la-ca-2019-oscar-red-carpet-roll-out-20190221-photogallery.html", "text": ""}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-oscars-set-design-david-korins-20190221-story.html", "text": "\u201cOh.

Some older citizens still call themselves Chinese. But their descendants\u2019 identities have evolved alongside Taiwan\u2019s social shifts: the lifting of martial law, political liberalization, educational reform and fluctuating relations with China.\n\nPublic opinion polls conducted since 1992 by National Chengchi University show a steady increase, from 17.6% to 54.5%, of Taiwanese people who identify as only Taiwanese. Those who say they are \u201cboth Taiwanese and Chinese\u201d have hovered around 40%.

An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nMei You-nian was 17 when he left Anhui, but he remembers his roots: carrying lunchboxes to the fields for his parents, herding cows on foot, his mother stanching his bloody noses in a straw-roofed home. He\u2019d never left the village until 1949, when his grandfather called a family meeting and told the military-aged men to go. You-nian was too young to fight, but he joined the Nationalist army as a military nurse.\n\nYou-nian followed an uncle to Shanghai, then took a boat to Taiwan. The journey took one week. You-nian threw up every day. They landed in the port city of Keelung right before the Dragon Boat Festival, where they bought bananas and zongzi, glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo leaves, from Taiwanese people.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have known that we wouldn\u2019t come back. We were just living one day at a time,\u201d You-nian recalled, sitting in a wrinkled green armchair in his Taipei apartment. On the wall, a world map with a Republic of China flag hung next to a collage of family photos. He opened a leather album of black-and-white snapshots. The first page contained small photos of a younger You-nian surrounding a larger portrait of Chiang Kai-shek in full military regalia.\n\n\u201cI adore him,\u201d You-nian said. He said he has voted for Chiang\u2019s Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, his entire life, and he served in the army until he was 70. By then, he was a lieutenant colonel.\n\nAn old photograph of Mei You-nian with his wife, Tsai-hui, hangs in their Taipei home. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nMei You-nian met his wife, Tsai-hui, while stationed in Penghu, a smaller island in the Taiwan Strait, and married at age 30. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nYou-nian met his wife while stationed in Penghu, a smaller island in the Taiwan Strait, and married at age 30. She was benshengren, a native Taiwanese descended from ethnic Chinese who had inhabited Taiwan since before Japan took over the island in 1895. Her family resisted their marriage initially, seeing You-nian as an outsider, but relented in the end. Their son Heng-han was born in 1964, between an older and a younger sister.\n\nGrowing up, Mei Heng-han said he took for granted that he was Chinese. \u201cWe were brainwashed to be Chinese. We called ourselves Taiwan province,\u201d he said.\n\nTaiwan was then under martial law, with harsh restrictions on press, speech, assembly and formation of new political parties. The ruling Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all of China, including the mainland, while the Communist Party in Beijing claimed the same.\n\nIn Taiwan\u2019s schools, class workbooks were printed with the imperative to \u201cBe a happy, lively student; be a proper, upright Chinese person.\u201d\n\nHeng-han\u2019s wife, who is also a benshengren, wasn\u2019t allowed to speak Hokkien, a dialect of Chinese spoken by descendants of Fujianese immigrants who\u2019d come to Taiwan during the Qing Dynasty. Their history wasn\u2019t taught in schools.\n\nMei Heng-han, the son of Mei You-nian, poses for a photo in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Growing up, Heng-han said he took for granted that he was Chinese. \u201cWe were brainwashed to be Chinese. We called ourselves Taiwan province,\u201d he said. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nIn 1989, after finishing university and army service, Heng-han went to study computer science in New Jersey. There, Americans asked him where he was from. He\u2019d say, \u201cTaiwan,\u201d and they\u2019d reply, \u201cOh, China.\u201d He\u2019d repeat, \u201cI\u2019m Taiwanese,\u201d and they\u2019d say, \u201cOh, Chinese.\u201d For the first time, Heng-han felt indignant that the rest of the world didn\u2019t seem to know Taiwan was different.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan was changing. In 1987, martial law was lifted. Suddenly, it was safe to speak Taiwanese dialects such as Hokkien, to criticize the Kuomintang, to have opposition parties and to mobilize civil society.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201990s, society changed. People started to discuss national identity, Taiwanese independence, democratic transition,\u201d said Chang Tieh-chih, deputy secretary-general of Taiwan\u2019s General Assn. of Chinese Culture. \u201cYou had social movements at every level, in communities, among aboriginal people, with labor unions \u2014 the original values were really challenged.\u201d\n\nOne of the major reforms took place in education. Taiwanese schools added a Taiwan-centric history curriculum, starting with 400 years of Taiwan\u2019s history, before and after 1949. Previous textbooks had focused on Chinese history, tracing a line from China\u2019s imperial dynasties to the 1911 Xinhai Revolution to the Kuomintang loss in 1949. Taiwan had been a postscript. Now it was the main subject.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a paradigm change,\u201d Chang said.\n\nShayne Mei, son of Mei Heng-han, walks with his girlfriend, Daphne Chiu, at National Taiwan University in Taipei. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nIn 1995, Mei Heng-han\u2019s son Shayne was born. He grew up in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, but then went to Taipei, the capital, to study foreign languages and literature at National Taiwan University. Shayne met his girlfriend, Daphne Chiu, on campus. They wear rainbow bracelets to support marriage equality and speak English with perfect accents, his British, hers American. For them, Taiwanese independence is a given, along with social values such as LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cWe think about China all the time. It\u2019s a threat, a bully, something we\u2019ll have to avoid,\u201d Shayne said.\n\nIsolation-wary, Chinese-speaking Taiwan moves to make English an official language \u00bb\n\nShayne and Daphne were both too young to vote in 2016 (the voting age is 20 in Taiwan), when pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen was elected. But they participated in November\u2019s midterm election and referendum. Referendum topics included whether to recognize same-sex marriage and whether Taiwan should compete as \u201cTaiwan\u201d instead of \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d in the Olympics. Both were rejected.\n\nShayne was shocked. He\u2019d thought he knew exactly how people would vote.\n\n\u201cI feel confused. I\u2019m losing this sense of self-identity and belonging. All these people, they don\u2019t even agree on what country we are,\u201d he said.\n\nTaiwanese had been convinced by media claims that their athletes would get shut out of the Olympics if they angered China by changing their competition name, Shayne said, which just showed how emotional and easily manipulated his compatriots were.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just cowards,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel really powerless.\u201d\n\nDaphne didn\u2019t understand how people could fail to empathize with the gay community. To her, it was a moral imperative to support equal rights; she couldn\u2019t fathom how other voters could see same-sex marriage as a matter of opinion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really depressed and disappointed about Taiwanese people. That\u2019s why I want to leave here,\u201d she said. Both are applying for graduate school in the United States.\n\nShayne Mei and his girlfriend, Daphne Chiu, wear rainbow bracelets to support marriage equality and speak English with perfect accents, his British, hers American. For them, Taiwanese independence is a given, along with social values such as LGBT and women\u2019s rights. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nChang Mau-kuei, a sociologist at Taiwan\u2019s national academy, Academia Sinica, pointed out that identity is a product of lived experience, which can vary so widely between different generations that they exist in disparate worlds. One factor influencing Taiwanese identity has been the experience of meeting mainland Chinese people, which was only possible after 1987, the year Taiwan and China began permitting cross-strait visits.\n\n\u201cUntil 1987, Taiwanese couldn\u2019t see any mainland Chinese. In propaganda, they were Communist, \u2018bad Chinese,\u2019\u201d Chang said. \u201cThen, they met! Suddenly you see real Chinese, good and bad, relatives or not, employees, bosses, marriages \u2014 a separate identity emerged from interaction. The more you interact, the more you find you are different.\u201d\n\nIn 1991, Mei You-nian went back to Anhui, only to find that his parents and siblings had starved to death during China\u2019s 1960s famine. He knelt at his family\u2019s grave, weeping, when he found out. The Chinese relatives called You-nian uncle, and he felt at home. He filled a bottle with Anhui soil and brought it back to Taipei.\n\nIn 2001, Mei Heng-han went to Anhui with his father. He added some of his distant relatives on WeChat, and ordered a gift from Taobao , an online shopping site, when one of their sons got married. Otherwise, they rarely talked.\n\nHe\u2019s also been to China on state-sponsored business tours encouraging Taiwanese investment in Fujian, the closest mainland province to Taiwan. His main impression was that China develops quickly, but is rife with scams. Heng-han has stopped calling himself Chinese, except when doing business with Chinese people.\n\nShayne has never been to Anhui. His grandfather gave him a red packet of money when he graduated in 2018, saying he wanted him to get a doctorate, and then he\u2019d bring his grandson to the village and show him off. Shayne cringed at the idea. \u201cI\u2019m getting a master\u2019s, not a PhD, and then I\u2019m going to work in tech,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019d visit Anhui if his grandfather really wanted, though.\n\nalice.su@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @aliceysu"}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-parkland-fathers-20190213-story.html#nt=barker", "text": "\u201cSo you and I are now eye to eye,\u201d Guttenberg told him. \u201cLook at me and tell me guns were the factor in the hunting of our kids in this school this week!

Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nNinety years ago, the lamps illuminated one of the most breathtaking living rooms in L.A. The residence belonged to Samuel Freeman and his dancer wife, Harriet, an avant-garde couple who had commissioned Wright to turn a steep and narrow plot in the Hollywood Hills into a showplace.\n\nThe architect, already famous and enjoying a midlife sojourn in California, ringed the living room with tall windows that provided dramatic views down Highland Avenue and of the surrounding hills.\n\nThe furniture he fashioned for the room included the 6-foot-high cast iron and glass lamps. His protege, Schindler, later worked on the house, adding his own unique furnishings.\n\nFor decades, the Freemans\u2019 eclectic crowd of artists, scientists and leftists savored the home and its decor. \u201cCasablanca\u201d actor Claude Rains was a regular at the couple\u2019s so-called salons, and Harriet Freeman feted legendary choreographer Martha Graham at a dinner party in the living room.\n\nSamuel Freeman died in the living room in 1981. Harriet suffered a stroke and spent her final months in a bed in the living room. She died in 1986. Childless, they left the home and furniture to USC, hoping the university would treasure the property as a site for meetings, classes and historic preservation.\n\nThe patterned cement blocks from the Freeman House. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright designed the house in the early 20th century. Los Angeles Times\n\nPreservationists quickly learned that maintaining the Freemans\u2019 home, like other Wright designs in L.A., would be a major challenge. The residence\u2019s hallmark \u2014 patterned cement-block walls that recalled Mayan temples \u2014 proved uniquely unsuited for California\u2019s seismic environment.\n\nThe Freeman House suffered severe structural damage in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Tiles tumbled from the house and broke. It took the university years to secure more than $1 million in restoration funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other sources.\n\nAround 2000, in advance of the work, USC moved the contents of the home, including the Wright and Schindler furniture, to the architecture school\u2019s rented warehouse. The brick facility on 24th Street, formerly a city power station, has a cavernous interior with at least one separate, locked room.\n\nSome broken tiles were stored in the main room while the furniture was placed in the locked area, according to people familiar with the warehouse. For the next decade, the pieces that had delighted the Freemans and their guests would sit in the dark, glimpsed only occasionally by USC faculty, staff and students.\n\nThe Freeman House in 1998 was supported by braces and had a tent over its roof after the Northridge earthquake. Bob Carey / Los Angeles Times\n\nA 1998 photograph shows damage to a wall at back of the Freeman House. Bob Carey / Los Angeles Times\n\nA facilities staffer visiting the warehouse in September 2012 noticed items missing from the locked room.\n\nThere was no sign of a break-in or vandalism, and nothing but the Wright and Schindler furniture seemed to have been taken.\n\nKenneth Breisch, an associate professor who oversaw the graduate program in historic preservation, said that as far as he knew, there was only one key to the room and it was maintained by the facilities department.\n\nThe staffer who had discovered the missing items contacted Breisch to see whether he knew anything. Told no, the staffer said he planned to alert campus police, according to Breisch.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\n\u201cI just assumed they were taking care of it,\u201d said Breisch, who declined to name the staffer. \u201cI just assumed, I think, that it probably didn\u2019t consist of anything of value, [otherwise] I would have heard more.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the stolen floor lamps and chair had significant value. The lamps are particularly rare and coveted by collectors. A nearly identical piece Wright made in the same period for a Hollywood Boulevard residence sold at auction two years ago for $100,000.\n\nTold of the lamps\u2019 theft recently, architect and author Thomas A. Heinz, the foremost expert in Wright\u2019s interiors, exclaimed, \u201cWow. Wow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause these are so rare, I would say it\u2019s a tremendous loss,\u201d said Heinz, adding that Wright created about a dozen such lamps.\n\nSchindler\u2019s chairs are also in demand. Last July, two of the architect\u2019s redwood \u201csling\u201d chairs were reported stolen from an Olympic Boulevard storage unit rented by the Friends of the Schindler House, the nonprofit that maintains the architect\u2019s former West Hollywood residence.\n\nBoard member Robert Sweeney told the police the chairs were original to the Kings Road landmark and estimated their value at $25,000 each.\n\nDespite the clear value of the items taken, no one at USC filed a report with campus police, LAPD or the university\u2019s insurance carriers. Word of the theft circulated among some at the architecture school, but few, if any, outsiders were told.\n\nIt remained a secret until last summer when someone\u2019s conscience appeared to have been prodded by a listing at a Chicago auction. The listing described the lot for sale as a \u201ctextile block from the Samuel Freeman House, Los Angeles\u201d and identified the seller as a private collector in Chicago. It was a 16-inch square, the size of the original Freeman blocks, and had discolorations indicating decades in the elements. It sold for $5,000 in June.\n\nWeeks after its sale, The Times received an anonymous email describing the warehouse theft. The author also included a link to the auction and wrote that even if the sale was not connected to the theft, it was troubling. How could the tile have fallen into private hands when its ownership had passed directly from the Freemans to USC, the writer asked.\n\nThe building in South Los Angeles from which the pieces were stolen. Patrick Fallon /For The Los Angeles Times\n\nThe Times approached USC about the alleged theft in mid-January. A university spokeswoman expressed skepticism, saying that even the most minor infractions are documented by the campus police and shared with administrators. It strained credulity, she said, that a suspected felony involving priceless works of art had gone unreported.\n\nA search of campus police databases and inquiries to half a dozen employees turned up nothing about a theft, she said. But further investigation by USC\u2019s Office of Professionalism and Ethics, a new unit set up after recent scandals, determined that the tip had merit.\n\nOn Jan. 22, campus police filed a report with the LAPD, identifying the three missing items. The university blamed the 6\u00bd-year delay in contacting authorities on a miscommunication between employees, according to police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite alarming, frankly, that there\u2019s a gap,\u201d said Lt. Perry Griffith of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Southwest station, who reviewed the report before handing it off to the department\u2019s Art Theft Detail.\n\nIn a statement, USC said it was fully cooperating with the police probe and pursuing its own internal investigation.\n\n\u201cThe university is reviewing its procedures and security measures related to the Freeman House and its assets,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement. She added that the university \u201cis working with its risk management team on the insurance claim process.\u201d\n\nLAPD Det. Don Hrycyk of the art theft unit said his investigation was at the preliminary stage.\n\n\u201cThere was no forced entry, so it looks like someone who had access to a key,\u201d Hrycyk said.\n\nUSC declined to identify those with access to the room and said in a statement, \u201cIt appears unlikely that there was only one key, however we expect that to be part of the investigation.\u201d\n\nThe passage of time had made dusting for fingerprints and other forensic techniques all but impossible. Memories have faded, and witnesses are out of reach.\n\n\u201cA lot of these people are no longer at USC,\u201d Hrycyk said.\n\nThe tile auctioned in Chicago is not part of the LAPD investigation, he said. USC said it had \u201cno verification\u201d as to whether it was stolen from the house.\n\nJeffrey Chusid, a Cornell University professor who is a leading authority on the Freeman House, said the auctioned tile appeared to be an original. Chusid, who lived in the house when he taught at USC in the 1980s and 1990s, said it was unlikely to be one that fell from the home during the earthquake because those were largely broken. During the 1990s, a vandal pried a tile from the street-side of the house, he said, \u201cand that might be floating around.\u201d\n\nRichard Wright, the president of the Chicago auction house, said the seller told him he obtained the piece several years ago from a dealer. Wright said he believed that the tile was originally from the Freeman House\u2019s garage and that it was removed after the 1994 earthquake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that there was some restoration done to the house,\u201d Wright said. \u201cGiven the not-great condition, it had been a tile that had been replaced.\u201d\n\nWright said the collector who consigned the tile had attested to the legal title of the concrete block. Still, he said that in the world of art auctions, \u201cit is not always perfectly clear how things get out.\u201d\n\nThe USC School of Architecture at the university's South L.A. campus. Patrick T.

(Jessica Chen / Los Angeles Times)\n\n9/11 upends the drug market\n\nTwenty years ago, when Castillo was a kid, the cartels that operated in Tijuana followed an established code.\n\nDrugs \u2014 mostly marijuana and cocaine back then \u2014 were peddled to tourists in the seedy red-light district or exported to the U.S.\n\nThe buyers were gringos, not Mexicans. Tijuana was what experts refer to as a trampoline, a strategic border point used to vault drugs north.\n\nThen, after 9/11, the deadliest attack by foreign terrorists on American soil, the U.S. began to invest billions in border security.\n\nNew surveillance technologies and a doubling of the number of Border Patrol staff made it much harder to smuggle drugs into the U.S.\n\nIndustrious traffickers responded by digging tunnels under the border and packing more vehicles with smaller shipments of drugs, knowing that many would get caught but some would get through.\n\nCrucially, traffickers also began offloading some of their product in Tijuana, paying local affiliates in drugs, which wound up on the streets for sale.\n\nCartels still prized trafficking routes to the U.S., but Tijuana emerged as a fledgling new market.\n\nIts substance of choice was cristal, which the cartels began making in larger quantities when the U.S. passed new restrictions on the sale of over-the-counter medicines that contain precursor chemicals.\n\nCristal offered a cheap high, and for many Tijuana residents who came from other parts of the country to work in the city\u2019s hundreds of low-slung border factories known as maquiladoras, a way to cope with the loneliness of living far from home.\n\nPublic health officials started noticing a rise in meth addiction about a decade ago.

There is a corpse in a ditch.\n\nBack at Red Cross headquarters that night, just after Mendez asked a friend for a pill to soothe his stomach ulcers, the radio on his hip squawked to life.\n\n\u201cCinco bravo,\u201d a dispatcher said. The code for a gunshot wound.\n\nBehind the story: How The Times reported on Tijuana's massive rise in homicides \u00bb\n\nIn a poor neighborhood not far from the border, Mendez found a shirtless man with tattoos on his chest who had been shot twice in the back and once in each hand. Mendez dropped to his knees and listened.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s alive!\u201d Mendez shouted. \u201cBring a stretcher!\u201d\n\nAs he loaded the man into an ambulance, the victim\u2019s teenage daughter appeared, shoeless and in shock.\n\n\u201cStay cool,\u201d Mendez said as he guided her into the front seat and buckled her seat belt. \u201cStay calm.\u201d\n\nHer father was alert and moaning when staffers wheeled him into the hospital.\n\nA few hours later, he was dead.\n\nNew cartel brings new level of horror\n\nIn 2008, homicides in Tijuana hit a new high of 825.\n\nThe Sinaloa cartel, headed by Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, had tried to take over trafficking routes controlled by the Tijuana cartel and the results were deadly.\n\nBrutal fighting erupted between the cartels \u2014 and between the cartels and police and the hundreds of soldiers that then-President Felipe Calderon had sent to Tijuana as part of his new U.S.-backed war on drugs.\n\nThe city had never experienced anything like it. Assassins hung bodies from bridges and rolled dismembered heads down city streets. One day, seven police officers were ambushed and killed in the span of 45 minutes. Even wealthy areas were not safe from shootouts.\n\nWarfare was expensive, so gang leaders began kidnapping residents for ransom, spurring an exodus of the city\u2019s upper class. Tourism, on which the economy depended, dried up.\n\nBut by late 2010, the killings had begun to subside and peace seemed to have returned.\n\nCalderon said his government was winning the war on drugs \u2014 and that Tijuana was proof.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of civic and business leaders that year, he credited his government\u2019s \u201ckingpin strategy,\u201d which targeted cartel leaders.\n\nTijuana, he said, was \u201ca clear, concrete example \u2026 that the challenge of security has a solution.\u201d\n\nWhen he mentioned Gen. Alfonso Duarte Mugica, who had been leading the fight against the cartels in Tijuana, the crowd burst into applause.\n\nBy 2012, the number of homicides had fallen to 367, and Tijuana was blossoming into a tourist destination known for its craft breweries, art and music scene and haute cuisine.\n\nBut the peace did not last.\n\nWith the Sinaloa cartel beset by infighting after Guzman\u2019s arrest in 2014, other cartels saw opportunity.\n\nSoon the newly ascendant Jalisco New Generation Cartel muscled into Tijuana. It wanted access to the border, and also sought control of the city\u2019s local drug trade.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the annual body count jumped from 493 to 919. But that was only a prelude to a bigger explosion in violence.\n\nWhat the children see in Tijuana\n\nCaught in the middle of the chaos were men like Rafael Noriega Pe\u00f1a.\n\nNoriega came to Tijuana as a teenager from the coast of Sonora state, where the only decent work was overnight fishing on the Sea of Cortez.\n\nHis parents, who toiled in the maquiladoras, warned him and his siblings to stay away from the narcos.\n\n\u201cIf you go out with wolves, they will teach you to howl,\u201d his mother used to say.\n\nBy the time he was in his 30s, Noriega had five children with two women, a factory job he hated and a raging addiction to cristal.\n\nHis siblings pooled their meager factory wages so he could enter a rehabilitation facility in late 2017. Each weekend, they brought him homemade chile rellenos.\n\nNoriega left the program in March, but his sobriety didn\u2019t last.\n\nShortly before dawn one morning in May, his mother awoke to the sound of five gunshots. She stumbled, screaming, to his room off the back of the house. He was slumped in a chair, dead.\n\nImages from the front lines of Tijuana's deadly drug war \u00bb\n\nHis relatives don\u2019t know who killed him or why. The night of the shooting, they gathered in the kitchen while their children played outside with strips of crime scene tape.\n\nTomas, who was now his mother\u2019s only son, put his arms around her.\n\n\u201cYou have four other children to live for,\u201d he said as she sobbed.\n\nHis 6-year-old daughter, Michel, entered the house with a toy gun. She pointed it at him and pretended to shoot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a narco!\u201d she said, giggling.\n\nHe shook her by the shoulders. \u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d he asked angrily.\n\nHe released her. He knew the answer.\n\n\u201cAs a child ... what do you see here?\u201d he said, with tears in his eyes. \u201cPure violence.\u201d\n\nPolice raids seem futile\n\nThe police officers locked eyes, nodded, then stormed into the squalid apartment building on a hunt for drug dealers.\n\nThey moved down a corridor with flashlights, kicking open doors of cell-like rooms strewn with used needles, mattresses and cups of urine.\n\nThere were no dealers, just sprawled-out junkies who barely noticed the intrusion.\n\nThe police moved on to their next target, a dimly lighted watering hole called Norteno Bar tucked amid the strip clubs and taco shops of Tijuana\u2019s Zona Norte.\n\nPolice frisked more than a dozen patrons and found only a single dose of meth, in the pocket of a man in his 70s.\n\nRaids like these, conducted one night in December, are among the city\u2019s primary tactics to reduce violence. But many here believe they are futile, and that time and resources would be better spent on intelligence-driven policing to identify those likely to carry out violence.\n\nA specialized Tijuana city police unit performs stop-and-frisk raids for drugs and firearms at the Norteno Bar in Tijuana. Such raids are among Tijuana\u2019s primary tactics to reduce violence and drug deals. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times\n\nState investigators and prosecutors also have a role to play: More than 9 out of 10 of Tijuana\u2019s killings go unsolved.\n\nCritics say the homicide crisis has gotten short shrift because most of the victims are addicts and dealers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to watch them not manage the problem and just wait for them to kill themselves,\u201d said Jaime Arredondo, a researcher at the British Columbia Center on Substance Use who has spent years studying Tijuana\u2019s local drug trade.\n\nThe city\u2019s police chief, Marco Antonio Sotomayor, has said repeatedly that tourists and most residents shouldn\u2019t worry about the violence.\n\n\u201cThose who are dying are young people and criminals who get into a world where they know that part of the risk of that business is \u2026 that they will lose their lives,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to understand the city is not on fire,\u201d he said.\n\nAdela Navarro Bello, the director of Zeta magazine, which has long chronicled cartel activity in Tijuana, said such a view was shortsighted.\n\nThe 2008 spike in violence proved that battles between the cartels hurt society as a whole, she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t put an end to this fight, this is going to grow.\u201d\n\nA high-ranking state police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said cartel leaders might themselves be unable to control the violence, which is fueled by easy access to guns smuggled from the U.S. and assassins who will kill for as little as $50 or a few hits of meth.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t control it,\u201d the official said, \u201cthey can\u2019t control it.\u201d\n\nKidnapped, tortured, killed\n\nTwo years ago, Antolin Tinajero was kidnapped in a meth lab by members of an opposing gang, tortured and left dead on the side of a road.\n\nHis brother Lucio, who was also at the lab that day, escaped and went into hiding.\n\nLater that year, his brother Cipriano was shot and killed in an altercation outside his house.\n\nHis brother Mario was also shot \u2014 at the local tiendita \u2014 but survived.\n\nTheir sister Esperanza Navarro, the lone girl of 10 siblings, went to the hospital or the morgue each time because her mother, a migrant from Guadalajara who cleaned houses for a living, was illiterate and could not fill out the paperwork.\n\nEsperanza pleaded with her brothers to leave drugs behind: \u201cAll you do is cause pain,\u201d she told them.\n\nA cluster of mass graves where unidentified bodies \u2014 the majority of them homicide victims \u2014 are buried in Tijuana after they are transported from the city\u2019s Medical Forensic Service morgue.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLast year, her brother Francisco decided she was right and tried to get clean.\n\nAs a local dealer in a dangerous neighborhood called Camino Verde, he knew that if he crossed from the hill where he lived to another one about half a mile away, he could be killed. \u201cThe violence is with the low-level people,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the chiefs.\u201d\n\nOne day in August, he went to pick up his son, who was with his mother on the other hill.\n\nHe was ambushed by a gunman, who shot him in the face, the top of the head and the arm.\n\nHe survived, though his speech is now slurred. His sister thinks he is using drugs again.\n\nShe wishes she could leave Tijuana with her three children but is too poor: \u201cYou want to grab your family and go as far as you can.\u201d\n\nTrying to get clean \u2014 again\n\nDrug rehab is a growing industry in Tijuana, with 98 state-certified centers in the city compared with 60 in 2007.\n\nAt Una Nueva Vida \u2014 or A New Life \u2014 roughly 70% of 170 residents are being treated for meth addiction, said its director, Ernesto Chavez Gutierrez, a former lawyer who is also a recovering addict.\n\nOne of the youngest, a 14-year-old, was brought to the center several months ago by his weeping father. Local gang members had come to the house to try to kill the boy, who had begun hallucinating and stealing cars.\n\nThe father couldn\u2019t afford the $370 a month treatment fee, so Chavez gave him a break.\n\nA few months later, the father returned and checked himself into the program. He, too, was addicted to meth.\n\nChristian Castillo checked himself into Una Nueva Vida last summer, spending the first week locked in a room with a television to detox. He is now seven months clean and is doing so well that he has been given a leadership role. He carries a walkie-talkie and keeps the peace among residents, whose cravings can sometimes make them violent.\n\nCastillo plans to wait an additional five months before he leaves rehab.\n\nHe has gone through this twice before. The last time, he was on the streets for two hours before he started using again.\n\nChristian Castillo, right, with Kevin Orozco on Dec. 31 during Castillo\u2019s treatment for his addiction to crystal methamphetamine at Una Nueva Vida rehabilitation facility.

Most are in Southern California, a few are farther north. All are drawn from our popular California Bucket List, which has grown to more than 365 entries.\n\nSan Diego\n\nCrystal Pier Hotel, Pacific Beach , San Diego. Christopher Reynolds/Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: You won't find another pier in California with cottages on it, and this pier stands along one of San Diego's most popular beaches.\n\nWhat: The Crystal Pier Hotel & Cottages go back to the 1930s. Despite changes in owners (and many a dispute with city officials) in early decades, the operation has been run by the same family since 1961. The pier is wooden, with fishing at the end. The 31 units are painted white with blue trim and flower boxes. The beachfront promenade, Ocean Front Walk, is San Diego's answer to Venice -- a boisterous concentration of people, bikes and beach culture that runs three miles through the Pacific Beach and Mission Beach neighborhoods.\n\nWhere: 4500 Ocean Blvd., San Diego, 115 miles southeast of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: Rooms (with kitchenettes) run $380 to $600 in summer, with a three-night minimum. And take note: You can't make reservations online -- just by phone and in person.\n\nJalama\n\nJalama Beach County Park, Santa Barbara County. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: Raw coastline, juicy burgers.\n\nWhat: To reach Jalama Beach County Park, you follow a twisting, two-lane highway from Lompoc to the edge of the continent and confront a horizon full of rough surf and raw, windy coastline. This campground (better for beachcombing than swimming) feels solitary, but there's a general store where they'll make you a Jalama Burger (carnivores, say yes) and sell you firewood or groceries, wine or beer. There are 109 campsites, some cabins, hot showers, a playground and a set of railroad tracks.\n\nWhere: 9999 Jalama Road, Lompoc \u2014 which is actually 18 miles southwest of Lompoc, 170 miles northwest of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: $10 per car. Jalama Burger, $7.95.\n\nBolsa Chica, Huntington Beach\n\nMike Anderson of Covina relaxes under an umbrella next to his Casita at Bolsa Chica State Beach in Huntington Beach. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: It's elementary. Homo sapiens like sitting on sand, watching water lap the shore while a bonfire crackles in a light breeze.\n\nWhat: Bolsa Chica State Beach is a prime beach bonfire destination, three miles long, with 200 fire rings available nightly (first come, first served) from 6 to 10 p.m.\n\nThat's an increasingly rare distinction. Authorities have banned fires in many coastal areas, focusing increased attention on those that remain.\n\nBolsa Chica, a long, flat beach, is also known for its surf fishing and grunion runs. Just inland you have the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, a 1,300-acre estuary and wetlands area that attracts about 200 species of birds (and almost as many sub-species of birders). There are various beach concessions nearby.\n\nWhere: Bolsa Chica, north of Huntington Beach's Seapoint Street and south of Warner Avenue, is 33 miles south of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: Day use is $15 per car.\n\nBolinas, Marin County\n\nSmiley's Schooner Saloon & Hotel, Bolinas, Calif. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: Bolinas, a lagoon-adjacent haven of 1,600 bohemian souls in an oft-overlooked corner of Marin County, has been operating incognito for decades. Locals steal road signs so that outsiders can't find their way in.\n\nNow that attitude might be softening, and the town, surrounded by hiking, surfing and kayaking opportunities, is fascinating.\n\nWhat: About 50 years ago, hardcore Bolinas locals started stealing the town's highway sign and they never stopped. The goal, conceived in back-to-the-land idealism, was to build a nature-friendly community without the distractions and economic distortions of tourism.\n\nBut as properties turn over and GPS renders signage moot, Bolinas seems to be evolving. Whether you're on the water or Wharf Road, it's a great place to think about hippie legacies and the nature of community at a time when Bay Area real estate is very nearly a blood sport.\n\nDon't expect a tourist welcome center, but if you show up mellow and humble there's no reason you shouldn't drop in for a bite at the Coast Cafe; browse the tiny but well-appointed Bolinas Museum (open Fridays through Sundays only), or drink at Smiley's Schooner Saloon and Hotel, which goes back to the 19th century.\n\nIn fact, Smiley's (which got new owners in 2015) offers live music four nights a week and rents out six rooms in back. I slept comfortably in one. On the street and in Smiley's, I was an obvious outsider with a camera around my neck, but everyone I met treated me well.\n\nYou'll see plenty of gray ponytails (and experience rotten cellphone service). And keep an eye out for BO Gas, the only nonprofit service station I've ever encountered. The rates are shockingly high ($4.66 a gallon in early August) but the money helps support the Bolinas Community Land Trust.\n\nWhere: Wharf Road, the commercial heart of town, is 25 miles northwest of San Francisco, just north of Stinson Beach, south of Point Reyes Station, 414 miles northwest of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: It's free to take a walk or check out the museum. The rooms at Smiley's go for $135-$225 nightly.\n\nInfo: There's no Bolinas Visitors Bureau \u2014 probably never will be. But there's a Marin Convention & Visitors Bureau to tell you what's nearby.\n\nLa Jolla\n\nSunny Jim Sea Cave, with kayakers beyond, in La Jolla. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: It'll make you feel like a pirate. Or a sea lion.\n\nWhat: Back in the first years of the 20th century, somebody hatched a nutty idea and hired two guys to start digging through this sandstone bluff top toward a sea cave below. And they made it.\n\nNowadays, this neighborhood's real estate prices are enough to chase mere millionaires away, but if you enter the modest-looking Cave Store and head for the rustic-looking stairwell, the tunnel remains.\n\nIts 145 steps will take you down to where waves crash and sea lions sometimes bellow. Chances are you'll also see kayakers through the opening as they make their own approach to the same cave. (The store also stocks jewelry, art and souvenirs.)\n\nThe cave was nicknamed \"Sunny Jim\" by Frank Baum (author of \"The Wizard Oz\") because the outline of the opening looks like a cartoon character called Sunny Jim who was used in advertisements for British Force Wheat cereal products in the early 20th century. (Sunny Jim had unruly hair toward the back of his head.)\n\nWhere: 1325 Coast Blvd., La Jolla, 115 miles southeast of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: $5 for adults, $3 for kids 16 and younger. Open daily. Kayak tours of the caves start at about $40.\n\nManhattan Beach\n\nCasual volleyball action, just north of the pier, in Manhattan Beach. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: If this were just any wealthy beach city, it would be a great place to run, bike, surf, people-watch and nurse your real estate envy. But Manhattan Beach is also the birthplace of beach volleyball as a way of life. Whenever you visit, you'll probably see seriously talented athletes at play.\n\nWhat: Among the South Bay beach cities of Redondo, Hermosa and Manhattan, this is the northernmost and wealthiest. Plenty of restaurants and shops are lined up on Manhattan Beach Boulevard, the main drag.\n\nAt the end of the boulevard, the concrete Manhattan Beach Pier reaches 928 feet into the sea, with a cafe and the small, kid-friendly Roundhouse Aquarium at the end.\n\nThe volleyball happens on the sand courts just north and south of the pier. Besides frequent competitions there are lots of classes for kids and adults. Be warned that the Manhattan Beach Open, a summer institution since 1960, draws tens of thousands of fans, making a demanding parking situation downright diabolical.\n\nNo matter when you visit, you can read the brass plaques along the pier's Manhattan Beach Open Volleyball Walk of Fame: Olympic gold medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings has seven plaques there. Karch Kiraly, also an Olympic gold medalist, has 10.\n\nTake a walk along the Strand or bike the Marvin Braude Bike Trail. (Both parallel the shore).\n\nGet a beer at Rock'n Fish, a cone at the always-busy Manhattan Beach Creamery, or a meal at any hour in The Kettle. (All three are within a few blocks on Manhattan Beach Boulevard.) The Shade Hotel is a short walk away, pricey and stylish, in Metlox Plaza.\n\nWhere: The Manhattan Beach Pier is 22 miles southwest of downtown L.A., 5 miles south of LAX.\n\nHow much: Ice cream cones at the Manhattan Beach Creamery cost $5.25 for a single, $6.25 for a double. Homes along the Strand routinely fetch $10 million.\n\nSanta Monica\n\nPacific Wheel, Pacific Park, Santa Monica Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: Unless you charter a flight or build a better jetpack, you won't get this view of Santa Monica, the bay and city, any other way.\n\nWhat: The Santa Monica Pier went up in 1909, was largely rebuilt in the 1980s, and added an amusement park, Pacific Park, in the 1990s. Basically, it's the payoff at the end of Route 66. Its high point, about 130 feet up, is the Pacific Wheel, a Ferris wheel that started spinning in 1996.\n\nOn your way to the wheel, notice the carousel, which you might remember from the 1973 movie \"The Sting.\"\n\nOnce you're aloft, take a good look at those bright lights all around you. They were amped up in May 2016. This is billed as the world\u2019s first and perhaps only solar-powered Ferris wheel. Kids taller than 42 inches can ride alone.\n\nWhere: 380 Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica, L.A. County, 16.7 miles west of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: $10 a ride.\n\nchristopher.reynolds@latimes.com\n\nFollow Reynolds on Twitter: @MrCSReynolds"}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-ballpark-roundup-20180517-story.html#nt=barker", "text": "By the way, I do know the Oakland A\u2019s play in the Oakland Coliseum and I aim to get there one day.

As a woman traveling alone, I hadn\u2019t expected to feel as comfortable as I explored the city day and night on my late November trip.\n\nYou\u2019ll find excellent cuisine and vibrant markets, as well as a remarkable roll call of cultural, culinary and outdoor events almost every day and night. It\u2019s a great place to prowl shop- and caf\u00e9-lined streets, urban plazas and parks, and the region\u2019s best museums.\n\nM\u00e9rida is also a charming, less-touristed base than Canc\u00fan and Playa del Carmen for exploring the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula\u2019s more remote ruins, wilderness, beaches and cultural outposts.\n\nWithin two hours\u2019 drive are the Maya archeological UNESCO World Heritage sites of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Uxmal. The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, another UNESCO site, is one of the largest forest reserves in Mexico, with jaguars, pumas, monkeys and flocks of flamingos. You can swim in cenotes \u2014 natural freshwater sinkholes \u2014 or explore caves, then take a day trip to gracious colonial missions and haciendas. Though the city is inland, long and quiet beaches are 40 minutes north at Progreso.\n\nA different path daily\n\nI had ambitious plans to do those things outside the city limits, but I quickly fell into a relaxing routine of exploring and never ran out of discoveries.\n\nEach morning I chose a different route to stroll to the city center amid the tolling of church bells and the aroma of freshly squeezed oranges, toasting tortillas and Chiapas coffee.\n\nBreakfast might be a no-frills gourmet lineup of 75-cent tacos at iconic Wayan\u2019e or lingering at Chaya Maya a lively eatery in the courtyard of a traditional colonial house with staff clad in Maya clothing. Its Yucatecan breakfast dishes included my favorite \u2014 papadzules, hard-boiled eggs wrapped in tortillas and topped with a luscious pumpkin seed sauce.\n\nLou Spirito For The Times\n\nOn one of my first mornings, I joined a free English-language walking tour leaving from the central Plaza Grande that I hoped would help me get my bearings and sort out the historical background .\n\nThe nostalgic clip-clopping of horses on cobblestones reverberated off the grand buildings surrounding the main square. One of them was the late 1540s Catedral de San Ildefonso, built by Spanish conquistadors using relics from earlier Maya temples in the ancient Maya city of T'ho.\n\nAfterward, to escape the midday heat, I headed inside for a closer \u2014 and often air-conditioned \u2014 look at the Palacio de Gobierno with its vast murals; the Palacio Municipal with town views from the stone balcony; and the palatial Casa de Montejo, a 16th century mansion that was once the residence of the Spanish conquistador leader.\n\nThe grand interior of the Palace of the Government facing over Merida\u2019s main town square. Margo Pfeiff\n\nThe Museo Fernando Garc\u00eda Ponce-Macay was filled with eccentric local and Mexican artwork. Although security guards sometimes asked me to sign a guestbook, all plaza museums and galleries were free.\n\nM\u00e9rida is one of those cities where the best entertainment is zigzagging lazily through a maze of candy-colored colonial buildings; poking into small shops and chic galleries; peeking into peaceful courtyards; or stopping for cocktails, microbrews or high-octane coffee at the hole-in-the-wall Caf\u00e9 Cafico. I clocked as many as 10 miles one day, people-watching and soaking up culture.\n\nStrolling was stress-less because streets were numbered \u2014 even- numbered streets ran north to south; odd-numbered streets east to west. That way, getting home or to a destination was more about math than maps.\n\nMarket at Eulogio Rosado Park. Margo Pfeiff\n\nHappily lost\n\nI did, however, purposely get lost weaving through the bustle and chaos of the Lucas de G\u00e1lvez Market, Merida\u2019s biggest, a noisy kaleidoscope of local sellers offering fresh produce and fragrant spices and herbs, homemade crafts and local clothing.\n\nAt the other end of the cultural spectrum I spent the best part of a day wandering along Paseo de Montejo, a broad, tree-lined avenue inspired by Paris\u2019 Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nThe most interesting stretch of the mile-long avenue ran between two colossal monuments, ending at the ornate Monumento a la Patria that\u2019s encircled by a busy roundabout.\n\nThe grand Monument to the Homeland on the broad Paseo de Montejo in Merida. Margo Pfeiff\n\nThe paseo is lined with white mansions, some dowdy, others elegantly restored and home to stately banks, company headquarters or lush residences. They date from the late 1800s to the 1920s when M\u00e9rida boomed as the world\u2019s rope maker with huge demand for henequen, from the sisal plant. When synthetic rope killed the market for henequen, the city became a quiet provincial capital until the late 20th century.\n\nSome of the mansions have been become museums. There are guided tours of the Casa Museo Montes Molina and its period furnishings,where generations of Montejos lived, descendants of M\u00e9rida\u2019s founder.\n\nArt deco home in need of a pick-me-up near downtown Merida. Margo Pfeiff\n\nNearby, the neoclassical Palacio Cant\u00f3n showcases Maya archaeology on two levels of a big mansion, a more intimate exhibit than the vast Gran Museo de Mundo Maya, designed in the shape of a bird\u2019s nest.\n\nI enjoyed long, lazy lunches, usually in the relative quiet of one of the many shaded parks and plazas around Merida. I\u2019d slip in for a plate of cochinita pibil, slow-cooked pork marinated in sour orange, achiote and other spices, at Manjar Blanco, a simple eatery opposite Parque de Santa Ana that American chef Rick Bayless has raved about.\n\nThe iconic Yucatecan dish cochinita pibil at Manjar Blanco restaurant. Margo Pfeiff\n\nThere is a growing number of innovative, modern Mexican fine-dining restaurants, and vegetarian and vegan options are booming. There is even a slow-food market on Saturday mornings just outside the city center.\n\nOne of my favorite lunches was at Apoala, which serves Oaxaca fusion cuisine outdoors overlooking Parque Santa Lucia, M\u00e9rida\u2019s second-most-popular plaza.\n\nI loved chef Sara Mar\u00eda Gomez\u2019s octopus and scallop ceviche and her tempura-fried zucchini blossoms stuffed with cheese. I sipped my way through their creative list of well- crafted cocktails.\n\nMusic, dance and more\n\nFree concerts, cultural performances and other events jammed my calendar. Music \u2014 traditional and even big band \u2014 and folkloric ballet were performed almost every night somewhere in the city. The pace picked up on weekends, a nonstop fiesta when the entire city, it seemed, came out to play.\n\nOn Saturday evenings Noche Mexicana celebrated song and dance, including salsa, hip-hop and jazz, along Paseo de Montejo. Sidewalk cafes set up in the streets, families strolled and nibbled from food carts, and shops stayed open late.\n\nTwo traditional \"dancing dolls\" at a festival in a Merida cultural center. Margo Pfeiff\n\nOf course, bars and cantinas were also busy on Saturday with blaring music and fun late into the night. Fairly new on the scene are microbreweries such as Cerveza Patito, whose pints of vanilla porter and wheat beers you can sample at Hermana Rep\u00fablica, Bela Chela and other taprooms in the Centro neighborhood. Mercado 60 is a lively open-air evening food and drink market that even offers beer yoga.\n\nBut M\u00e9rida\u2019s traditional cantinas \u2014 bat-wing swinging doors \u2019n\u2019 all \u2014 were my favorite hangouts. Once the domain of macho men, several have been delightfully gentrified such as El Cardenal, with its tree-shaded courtyard, and the hip hangout La Negrita. Both offer great live music, a lively social scene and free snacks called botanas well into the night.\n\nOn Sunday morning cyclists take over some of the city\u2019s most beautiful and popular streets, such as Paseo de Montejo and Calle 60, are closed for Biciruta (Bike Route). I rented a bicycle from one of the many booths and pedaled amid families and couples.\n\nMeanwhile, M\u00e9rida en Domingo, or M\u00e9rida on Sunday, transformed the heart of the Centro Hist\u00f3rico, between Plaza Grande and Parque Santa Lucia, into an urban carnival and marketplace for the entire day.\n\nAs nighttime approached, bands began to play and people danced under the stars. I picked up a dish of fresh coconut ice cream, sat beneath a chorus of birds roosting in the trees and savored this Sunday night tradition, not regretting for one second that I had never left this charming colonial city.\n\nIf you go\n\nThe Fundaci\u00f3n de Artistas is a gallery/museum/caf\u00e9 in a traditional 19th century home.

The sound ripples to the back of the hall, guided by the curving plaster ceiling. The final \u201camen\u201d grows to 10, 15, 20 syllables, each one a slow-motion acrobat in flight.\n\nThat\u2019s how it went on a recent Sunday morning at the Salt Lake Tabernacle at Temple Square, a singular American music venue commissioned by Brigham Young and completed in 1867.\n\nThe 360 singers who call this building home are known as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir \u2014 or rather, they were until Oct. 5, when leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints renamed them the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square.\n\nIn the world beyond these walls, the group has been needled for its squeaky-clean image and song list, and for performing at President Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nBut the singers are a beloved avatar for the church, offering musical balm for all, backed by their own Twitter feed (since 2009) and YouTube channel (since 2012).\n\nAs for the building that houses them, one unimpressed 19th century visitor called it \u201ca pumpkin half-buried in the sand.\u201d To me, as light danced on its aluminum roof, the tabernacle looked like a surfacing submarine.\n\nThat shiny roof (a 1947 addition) is a great disguise for a frontier relic and a striking element among the landmark church buildings that make up Temple Square.\n\nThe site\u2019s singular history is more than enough reason to eavesdrop on choir practice (most Thursday nights) or to see a broadcast performance (every Sunday morning) or to drop by to hear a pin drop (which happens hourly to show off the hall\u2019s acoustics).\n\nThe choir tunes up\n\nA Thursday night rehearsal in the tabernacle, free to the public at 7:30, is a good place to start.\n\nOnce you\u2019re inside, look at the choir loft, where choir members will be meandering to their assigned seats, men on one side, women on the other, and making notes on their sheet music.\n\nChances are that music director Mack Wilberg will be up front with a microphone, delivering complaints, corrections and commendations with a dry wit.\n\n\u201cLadies, you sound great,\u201d he said. \u201cMen, you\u2019ve got to listen more to the ladies.\u201d\n\nThe Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. MOBILE CAPTION 2The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)\n\nTo win a place in this group, singers must belong to the church, be at least 25, no older than 55, and live within 100 miles of Temple Square. Besides an audition, they must pass an interview and music theory test.\n\nFor the 1 in 5 applicants who makes the grade, there are hundreds of songs to learn and a year-round schedule of rehearsals, broadcasts, performances, and sometimes recording sessions and tours.\n\nTo make way for new blood, once choir members have sung for 20 years or have reached the year of their 60th birthday, they\u2019re out.\n\nWhere we go to hear music, across the country \u00bb\n\nTeamwork is central. Unlike a lot of show business, singing in the choir is about disappearing into a well-disciplined crowd, a priority that harmonizes with many LDS church teachings.\n\nOh, and there is no paycheck; all choir members are volunteers. Administration and logistics are handled by a general manager and a paid staff of about a dozen.\n\nMeanwhile, outside Temple Square, ever-more-secular Salt Lake City (population about 200,000) offers ever more entertainment options.\n\nThe weekend of my visit, the Utah Symphony was in Abravanel Hall, the Damned were due to play the Depot, and a production of \u201cThe Rocky Horror Show\u201d was nearing the end of its run on the Grand Theater stage.\n\nAlthough the church bans the consumption of alcohol and coffee, brew pubs, coffee houses and even a few distilleries dot the city.\n\nNobody pictured this in 1847, when the choir first formed under church president Young. The church itself had been founded less than 20 years before by Joseph Smith in upstate New York.\n\nMormon pioneers had just begun settling in Utah, and the Salt Lake Valley was mostly dry and nearly empty.\n\nBefore long, Young was planning a temple (a tall, stone landmark that took 40 years to complete) and the tabernacle, which would be made of Utah pine, about 75 feet tall, 150 feet wide and 250 feet long, capped by a gently curving roof.\n\nThe tabernacle rises\n\nAerial photograph of TheTabernacle, Salt Lake City, Utah Alamy Stock Photo\n\nYoung worked with local architects and a bridge designer to craft one big room with uninterrupted sightlines and lively acoustics so a preacher\u2019s voice could carry. That meant thinking outside the architectural box.\n\nYoung eventually chose an oval design, the roof held aloft and shaped by wooden lattice truss arches \u2014 a bridge-builder\u2019s trick \u2014 held together by iron nails, bolts and wooden pegs above 44 stone piers.\n\nAs you walk the aisles, look closely and you\u2019ll see that the builders painted pine columns to look like marble and disguised pine benches to look like oak. (Only in the last 20 years has the church replaced most of the pine benches with genuine oak.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also notice the organ \u2014 an 11,623-pipe affair that towers behind the choir loft like the bow of a great ship. It isn\u2019t the original but a descendant of one built in the 1860s, using hardware from Boston and pipes carved from more Utah pines.\n\n\u201cSit in the front row and you hear the music hit you right away,\u201d Stephanie Wood, an 18-year choir member, told me. \u201cYou sit in the back row and it feels like it wraps around the building before you hear it.\u201d\n\nSalt Lake Temple, Temple Square. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nWood sings alto. In the choir loft, she said, there are spots \u201cwhere you can\u2019t hear really at all. You sit there and you think, \u2018I\u2019m singing by myself.\u2019 But you know you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nThe building \u201cjust oozes history,\u201d said Matt Harmer, a 54-year-old attorney and father of seven who started singing baritone with the choir this year.\n\nHarmer said he had worried that singing would cut into his skiing, rock-climbing and hiking, but the first time he stood in the tabernacle to sing \u201cCome, Come Ye Saints,\u201d a hymn from the church\u2019s early days, he realized he had chosen well.\n\n\u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d he said, \u201cjust to have a chance to sing this song that has meant so much to so many people in this faith, in this building that people sacrificed so hard to build.\u201d\n\nMost visitors don\u2019t get invited to climb into the rafters, but if you could (or if you peek at my video), you would see 21st century seismic upgrades alongside rawhide skins, which the pioneers tied around split planks to strengthen them. You would also see thousands of organ pipes, mostly clustered above the stage.\n\nThe day I watched, organist Linda Margetts dropped three pins, one by one, and then a nail to show how freely sound travels\n\nSome, known as pioneer pipes, date to the building\u2019s first days and stand as tall as 30 feet, producing tones that seem more seismic than sonic.\n\nAnd if an organist should start to play loudly while a newcomer is climbing around those pipes \u2014 well, let\u2019s just say that for a few moments during my exploration with master keyboard technician Robert Poll, death by bass note seemed a real possibility.\n\nFor a less rattling introduction to the building\u2019s acoustics, visitors need only stop in for the tabernacle\u2019s free daily organ recital (noon Mondays-Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays). The pin-drop demonstrations also take place, typically every hour on the hour, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nThe day I watched, organist Linda Margetts dropped three pins, one by one, and then a nail \u2014 which resounded like a rifle shot \u2014 to show how freely sound travels about 170 feet from the stage to the back row.\n\nThen Margetts played, her hands dancing among the instrument\u2019s five keyboards, then pausing while her feet worked the pedals. At one point, tapping out 16th-note triplets, she looked like an Irish dancer, arms at her sides, feet flying.\n\nThat was a spectacle I hadn\u2019t expected. But I still hadn\u2019t experienced the full tabernacle choir.\n\nTabernacle Choir singers take a snack break just before their usual Sunday broadcast performance. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nFor that, you need an evening performance or a Sunday morning broadcast of the show that made the choir famous.\n\nLights, camera, choir\n\n\u201cMusic & the Spoken Word,\u201d a 30-minute m\u00e9lange of song, organ music and inspirational narration, began as a radio show in 1929.\n\nBy 1949, the choir, which had been recording for decades, was releasing its first commercial album on Columbia Records. By the 1960s, the broadcast was televised, and the choir was singing for presidents, touring the world, and working with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra.\n\nMore recent collaborators have included Audra McDonald, Yo-Yo Ma, James Taylor and most recently Kristin Chenoweth, who joined this year\u2019s holiday shows.\n\nOn my Sunday morning, I found the choir members decked out in formal wear (men in dark suits and ties, women in beige gowns).\n\nMakeup before Tabernacle Choir performance Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe tabernacle\u2019s benches, typically arranged to hold as many as 3,000 listeners, were about two-thirds full. A church hostess warmed up the crowd and welcomed groups from Ecuador, Myanmar and Taiwan \u2014 reminders of the church\u2019s global recruitment efforts.\n\nAfter the countdown to open the broadcast, a narrator welcomed us in fatherly tones and organist Richard Elliott leaned over the keyboards.\n\nMeanwhile, a sophisticated lighting system threw intense colors onto the curving wall behind the choir \u2014 sometimes blue, sometimes purple, sometimes red, which made the gold-leaf organ pipes glow like flames.\n\nSeveral hymns, folk songs and other pieces followed, including \u201cUbi Caritas.\u201d\n\nIn the morning\u2019s spoken interlude, narrator Lloyd D. Newell reminded us that 1.) you shouldn\u2019t let other people\u2019s social media feeds get you down and 2.) \u201cfun and happiness are not the same thing.\u201d\n\nEdgy it was not. But those 360 voices, raised together, were something to hear. I eventually spotted Wood among the altos and Harmer with the baritones.\n\n\u201cI know there are a lot of people who enjoy doing stage productions and they like doing solos, and that\u2019s never been my forte,\u201d Wood had told me. \u201cI have always loved being one of many in creating an amazing sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want 360 soloists,\u201d Harmer had said.\n\nIn no time, the broadcast was winding up. It ended with the choir\u2019s voices on \u201cGod be with you till we meet again\u201d \u2014 predictable, perhaps, but warm and comforting on a winter day.\n\nIf you go\n\nTHE BEST WAY TO SALT LAKE CITY\n\nFrom LAX, American, Delta, United and Southwest offer nonstop service to Salt Lake, and Southwest, United, Delta and Alaska offer connecting service (change of planes).

Below, at the lip of the stage, a tall man in a black suit and white bow tie leaned forward with a tip about what I was about to hear.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be something,\u201d said Mark Jackobs, one of the Cleveland Orchestra\u2019s viola players. \u201cThis is a freight train.\u201d\n\nJackobs, who has played in the room for 25 years, knew just how the sound would flood Severance Hall, one of North America\u2019s most admired classical music venues.\n\nThis was my first concert in the hall, so I had plenty of questions. But before I could ask more, the lights dimmed in the 1,920-seat auditorium, and we rushed to our seats.\n\nConductor Franz Welser-M\u00f6st raised his baton. A hundred musicians, including Jackobs, snapped to attention. The train, also known as Prokofiev\u2019s Symphony No. 3, was leaving the station.\n\nInside the hall\n\nWhen the orchestra\u2019s leaders launched the campaign to build Severance Hall in 1928, Cleveland was on a roll. As America constructed skyscrapers, Cleveland\u2019s steel mills were shipping vast tonnage on Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River.\n\nThe city\u2019s population was about to hit 900,000. The orchestra, founded in 1918, had already played New York, made its recording debut and started on the path to worldwide acclaim.\n\nSince then, Cleveland has shrunk, suffered and been smirked at like few other American cities. But it also has reinvented itself and begun to bloom again.\n\nAs I explored the auditorium and roamed the city for four days in September, I was amazed that in the middle of a city so changed, the orchestra and its hall have never stopped doing what they set out to do.\n\nMORE photos of Severance Hall and Cleveland \u00bb\n\nA day before I heard the orchestra, Andria Hoy, its archivist, gave me a tour of the hall.\n\nFirst, I found my way to University Circle, the cultural hub about 5 miles east of downtown, where the hall, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the campus of Case Western Reserve University sprawl alongside the grassy expanses of Wade Park.\n\nThe art museum was terrific, from the Egyptian mummy cases to the gritty canvases of New York\u2019s Ashcan School. At the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, I got to look a live eagle in the eyes.\n\nThe concert hall, however, did not quicken my pulse right away. In fact, if architecture is frozen music, Severance Hall\u2019s Georgian neoclassical exterior is \u201cPomp and Circumstance\u201d at 23 beats a minute.\n\nBut inside, it\u2019s \u201cRhapsody in Blue\u201d meets \u201cKing Tut.\u201d Once you step into the grand foyer, you\u2019re swallowed by a mashup of Art Deco swoops and Egyptian Revival details.\n\nThe grand foyer in Severance Hall in Cleveland, Ohio.

Yet John didn\u2019t hesitate. Construction began a month after the crash, and he took every opportunity to stamp the concert hall with Elisabeth\u2019s personality, ultimately spending more than $2 million in Great Depression dollars, about $29 million today.\n\nThe intricate, lace-like aluminum leaf pattern on the ceiling is said to match Elisabeth Severance's wedding dress.

Thus, also, the lotus blossoms (her favorite flower) in the grand foyer\u2019s terrazzo floor.\n\nAs for the building\u2019s papyrus imagery and other Egyptian Revival touches, John Severance and his family were among the legions of wealthy Americans who journeyed to Egypt in the 1920s to see King Tut\u2019s newly uncovered tomb.\n\nMORE photos of Severance Hall and Cleveland \u00bb\n\n\u201cHe really turned this building into a memorial to her, which is where a lot of the opulence comes from,\u201d Hoy told me.\n\nThe grand foyer, a double-height oval space outfitted with marble from Italy and Indiana, is surrounded by two dozen columns, a series of Egyptian Revival murals and two sets of stately stairs.\n\nOutside the hall\n\nThe past 50 years have been rough on Cleveland. The city\u2019s economy stumbled in the 1960s, population began to plummet, crime jumped and the Cuyahoga River, profoundly polluted, caught fire more than once. The slump lasted decades. A wicked nickname emerged: the Mistake by the Lake.\n\nNowadays, the city\u2019s population is about 390,000; one steel mill remains. But Cleveland \u2014 the town that gave us Drew Carey, Halle Berry and Molly Shannon and great sports performances from running back Jim Brown of the Cleveland Browns and pitcher Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians\u2014 has pivoted.\n\nSkyline of Cleveland, Ohio. Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times\n\nMORE photos of Severance Hall and Cleveland \u00bb\n\nOn the Cuyahoga (no flames since 1969, thank you), you can see kayaks, rowers and the Nautica Queen, a dinner cruise ship.\n\nAs downtown reinvents itself, hotels, restaurants and Heinen\u2019s Grocery Store have taken over grand old bank buildings along Euclid Avenue. Condos and apartments are multiplying near the riverside. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Playhouse Square theater district have helped push tourism up by about 25% in the past six years.\n\nAnd Cleveland\u2019s orchestra? The musicians kept playing, touring and recording, never relinquishing the reputation that spread globally under the exacting George Szell, music director from 1946 to 1970.\n\nNew York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles may be bigger cities, but in January a New York Times headline proclaimed that \u201cAt 100, the Cleveland Orchestra May (Quietly) Be America\u2019s Best.\u201d (A later article in October noted that the orchestra had fired its concertmaster and principal trombonist for sexual misconduct and harassment.)\n\nB\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Leonard Bernstein, Wynton Marsalis, Yehudi Menuhin, Leontyne Price, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Mstislav Rostropovich \u2014 all have stood on the Severance Hall stage.\n\nIt remains the orchestra\u2019s home for about 100 performances a year in fall, winter and spring. (Concerts move to the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls in the summer.) The hall also hosts graduations, weddings, the Cleveland Pops Orchestra and other events.\n\nThe legacy\n\nThe Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Ingo Metzmacher perform at Severance Hall in Cleveland, Ohio. Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times\n\nMORE photos of Severance Hall and Cleveland \u00bb\n\nOn concert night, I arrived early so I could start with a meal at Severance, the venue\u2019s fine-dining restaurant. Solicitous service, tasty sea bass special. Good omens.\n\nThe music began with Prokofiev\u2019s Symphony No. 1, a sprightly, sunny work despite being composed while Russia and the rest of Europe were a mess. I\u2019m no music critic, but it sounded seamless and precise to me, and the rest of the room seemed to agree.\n\nThe hall was about two-thirds occupied, the crowd mostly 50 and older and white, although one or two sections were dominated by students. Eager to woo young and varied listeners, the orchestra offers free admission to those 18 and younger for many performances.\n\nThe next piece was Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 2 from 1931 \u2014 a challenging, dense work featuring ferocious guest pianist Yefim Bronfman. In one passage he seemed to conjure the sound of mist rising from a pond. In another, Bronfman played with such force and speed that his whole body shuddered.\n\n\u201cHe proved that the piano is a percussion instrument,\u201d usher Joette McDonald whispered to me later. She\u2019s been working concerts for 17 years \u201cbecause I\u2019m never disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt never gets old. I do. But it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter intermission was the sonic assault that Jackobs had warned me about, Prokofiev\u2019s third symphony, composed in 1928. Before beginning, Welser-M\u00f6st addressed the audience, suggesting that Sigmund Freud must have influenced this piece. He also asked us \u201cto listen for not just the melody but what is happening underneath.\u201d\n\nThen, from the first note: shrieking strings and brass, booming tympani, curious three-note clusters ascending and descending \u2014 a beginning as dark and alarming as the night\u2019s first Prokofiev piece had been bright and frisky.\n\nFrom there, things calmed a bit, with plenty of delicate passages. I could relax and look around a little. But this is a symphony that began its life as an opera about demonic possession, so chaos was bound to return.\n\nAt the close of the fourth movement, Prokofiev dispatched us with a pair of booming, dissonant full-orchestra chords. Utter doom, under a twinkling aluminum ceiling.\n\nAt the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the amps are turned to 11 to get effects like this. In Severance Hall, they do it without amplifiers, in a suit and bow tie, just as they have for 87 years.\n\nMore music\n\nClassical music, bread and water are all some people need. But if your appetites range more widely, Cleveland stands ready with rock and polka, beer and pirogis.\n\nFirst, the rock. Before you step into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, a plaque explains the city\u2019s claim on rock history: Alan Freed, a Cleveland disc jockey, popularized the phrase in the early 1950s.\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame, Cleveland. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe Hall of Fame opened at the edge of Lake Erie in 1995, relying on an elaborate system of nominations and balloting to celebrate a medium that\u2019s all about anarchy and subversion.\n\nIt has thoughtful exhibits and plenty of artifacts. Gawk at Elvis\u2019 double-neck guitar from the early 1960s. Giggle at the 1967 \u201cArnold Layne\u201d video in which the members of Pink Floyd cavort like the Monkees.\n\nThe hall has defined rock so broadly that there\u2019s room for Jay-Z and Taylor Swift. It also has a theater where great performances are screened, including a 2009 Madison Square Garden benefit that featured Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, James Taylor, B.B. King, Patti Smith, Mick Jagger, Metallica and many others.\n\nAs for polka, it\u2019s a fixture in Cleveland because of the city\u2019s Polish and Slovenian populations. I got my dose and a few pierogis at the Prosperity Social Club (1109 Starkweather Ave. in the Tremont neighborhood), where accordionist Stan Mejac holds court Wednesday nights.\n\nIf you go\n\nTHE BEST WAY TO CLEVELAND\n\nFrom LAX, United offers nonstop service to Cleveland, and Delta, United, American, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier offer connecting service (change of planes).

Now and again he\u2019d let his band, the 78\u2019s, carry the tune while he paused to pull on a bottle of whiskey.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re settin\u2019 here in the Mother Church,\u201d Morgan said, gazing at the colorful Gothic windows at the back. \u201cCome closer and sing with me.\u201d\n\nDown in front, hardcore fans raised their beers in salute. Up in the balcony, they were pounding on the oak pews and flinging fists at the ceiling.\n\nJust outside, Lower Broadway, a.k.a. the Honky Tonk Highway, was teeming with cover bands, club-hoppers and roving bachelorette parties. Two blocks south, Journey and Def Leppard had taken over the 20,000-seat Bridgestone Arena.\n\nIn the stadium across the Cumberland River, Taylor Swift was playing to a crowd of more than 50,000. And 11 miles northeast, Garth Brooks was headlining at the 4,400-seat Grand Ole Opry.\n\nNashville has music the way Willie Nelson has wrinkles. This city of 667,560 has grown so dramatically as a music industry hub, convention venue and tourist destination that if you went by the numbers, the Ryman\u2019s 2,362 seats would make it a minor player.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe building went up in 1892. And although it has hosted orchestras, opera singers and distinguished speakers, the Ryman\u2019s distinct character comes from being steeped in six generations of songs about whiskey, love, cars, joy, sorrow, farms, horses, mules, faithful dogs, faithless mates, mountains, hollows, wild flowers and lonesome train whistles.\n\nIt was home to the \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d radio show for more than 30 years. Now it hosts every stripe of country artist and a smattering of performers of just about every genre but rap.\n\nOn this stage, Bill Monroe and his band more or less created bluegrass music in 1945. One night in \u201949, lanky newcomer Hank Williams won over the crowd so thoroughly that he was called back for six yodeling encores of \u201cLovesick Blues.\u201d Johnny Cash first played here in 1956, got banned for bad behavior in 1965, returned to host a TV variety show in 1969-1971 and was mourned at a memorial in 2003.\n\nNow it was Morgan\u2019s turn at the Mother Church of country music. He brandished his guitar like a sidearm and barked happy profanities as he sang of lost souls, dead-end alleys, cocaine and old men who never gave a damn.\n\nVisit iconic music venues throughout the country \u00bb\n\nThis was a honky-tonk crowd, more Harley-Davidson than Stetson, more T-shirt than western wear. When Morgan called them brother truckers \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure that was the phrase \u2014 they roared with something like love.\n\nIt was a fine moment, and if the people who built this hall weren\u2019t already dead, it might have killed them.\n\nFrom tabernacle to \u2018Grand Ole Opry\u2019\n\nA few days later in the lobby, tour guide Jonathan Brodeur took us back to the 1880s, when the Civil War was a fresh memory and Nashville was about a tenth its current size.\n\nThomas Ryman was one of the city\u2019s richest men, having built an empire of riverboats with plenty of boozing and gambling.\n\nThen one day in May 1885, Ryman stepped into a big tent where a traveling preacher, the Rev. Sam Jones, had gathered thousands of Nashvillians. Jones launched a tirade against sin, and by the time he was done, the riverboat magnate was ready to repent.\n\nBefore long, Jones persuaded Ryman to pay for much of a new building to be shared by local and traveling preachers \u2014 a tabernacle to celebrate Nashville\u2019s newfound faith and probity.\n\nThe Gothic Revival landmark, designed by architect Hugh Cathcart Thompson, was to be built of brown brick with white trim around its tall, narrow windows. It would have a pulpit surrounded by curving wooden pews, seating thousands of worshipers. And it would stand just a block from the vice and revelry of Lower Broadway.\n\nExterior of Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. Exterior of Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. Exterior of the Ryman Auditorium, built in Gothic Revival style, in Nashville.\n\nBut what construction project ever went entirely according to plan? Years passed. Money ran low. By the time the tabernacle was completed in 1892, management needed to stage not only religious events but also secular programs, including lectures and music, to pay construction debts.\n\nBefore long, those secular shows began to reshape the space.\n\nBy 1897, the room had a new balcony, elegantly held aloft by several dozen slender steel columns, principally paid for by a Confederate veterans group. By 1901, the tabernacle\u2019s pulpit had been supplanted by a stage, the better to present opera singers.\n\nBy 1914 Ryman and Jones were both dead, and the tabernacle had been renamed Ryman Auditorium. Scheduling was handled by a former bookkeeper named Lula C. Naff, who would last more than 40 years in the job, booking whatever acts might sell, including orchestras, comedians, movies, theatrical productions, the Imperial Russian Ballet, the Hippodrome Circus, Booker T. Washington, Mae West, Helen Keller and W.C. Fields.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout Appalachia, thousands of amateur fiddlers, guitarists, banjo and mandolin players had been mixing European and African instruments, taking church tunes into the world and creating a new sort of music, rural, vital and uniquely American.\n\nThen in 1943, the music met the room. The \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d radio show, created in 1925 as a Saturday night celebration of country music and rural life, moved to the Ryman. Despite worries about rowdy crowds, Naff and \u201cOpry\u201d management agreed that the live broadcasts would fill the auditorium just about every Saturday night.\n\nView of Ryman Auditorium from the balcony in Nashville, Tennessee.

Interior of the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The balcony was mainly paid for by a Confederate veterans group in the late 1800s.\n\nBy the mid-1940s, comedian Minnie Pearl was a regular, hollering \u201cHowdy!\u201d and bringing homespun news from the half-fictional hamlet of Grinder\u2019s Switch.\n\nIn 1954 Elvis Presley sang Bill Monroe\u2019s \u201cBlue Moon of Kentucky,\u201d got a tepid response and never returned.\n\nIn 1957, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered desegregation of the nation\u2019s schools \u2014 and three years before many Nashville businesses were willing to integrate \u2014 Louis Armstrong played to a Ryman audience that was all white in the balcony, all black in the orchestra level, and targeted by an NAACP boycott.\n\nIn 1966, somebody decided that those tall, narrow windows could use some color and added red, yellow, green and blue tints, creating a stained-glass effect that made the space feel twice as ecclesiastical.\n\nBut even those who loved the Ryman had to admit that it was ungainly. No private dressing rooms. No air conditioning or elevators. And the surrounding neighborhood was getting seedy.\n\nMark Ribowsky, author of \u201cHank: The Short Life and Long Country Road of Hank Williams,\u201d writes that \u201cthe hall was cramped and dirty, smelling of urine leaking from stuffed-up bathrooms and sweat.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegularly, patrons would faint and need to be carried out into the lobby just to breathe.\u201d\n\nIt got so bad, Ribowksy wrote, that Roy Acuff, a major Nashville power broker and member of the \u201cOpry\u201d since 1938, in 1971 called it a miserable place to perform and said, \u201cI never want another note of music played in that building.\u201d\n\nThe Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, built to house preachers in the 1890s, grew into a beloved home for country musicians for much of the 20th century. (Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAnd sure enough, in 1974 the \u201cOpry\u201d fled to a bigger, custom-built hall, 11 miles northeast of downtown \u2014 but first, workers cut out a circle from the Ryman stage to install at the new venue to signal continuity.\n\nThe Ryman, apparently doomed, languished for nearly 20 years.\n\n\u2018At the Ryman\u2019\n\nBy the time Emmylou Harris and the Nash Ramblers recorded a live album there in 1991, the structure was so iffy that no one was allowed to sit on or beneath the balcony.\n\nThat left only about 200 usable seats, but Harris did three shows, savoring the chance to \u201cfeel the hillbilly dust\u201d and dance on stage with 79-year-old Bill Monroe. The resulting record and documentary, \u201cAt the Ryman\u201d (1992), rallied public support for the rescue and restoration of the old hall.\n\nIn 1992 the building\u2019s owner, now known as Ryman Hospitality Partners, announced plans for major renovations. In 1994 the auditorium reopened and a new era dawned.\n\nAddition to the Ryman Auditorium after renovations. Albert Vecerka\n\nToday the Ryman hosts about 200 shows a year, including visits from the \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d every winter and occasional church services and funerals. About 250,000 people a year book tours. The escorted version runs about 40 minutes, takes you through dressing rooms and onto the stage, and costs about $35.\n\nAnd on stage, the story continues to unfold. In April 2017 Loretta Lynn marked her 85th birthday by performing a pair of sold-out Ryman shows.\n\nFive months later, 23-year-old pop singer Harry Styles , formerly of One Direction, made his Ryman debut, telling the audience: \u201cWhen we booked this tour, this was kind of the reason. This room.\u201d\n\nIn August, as Morgan rollicked toward the end of his gig, he was just as reverent about the room but gruffer. He even bowed to history by covering favorites from Roger Miller and John Prine.\n\nThen Morgan went back to his own lyrics, celebrating sinning, whiskey and just about everything that the Ryman\u2019s builders wanted to wipe from this world. Behind him, the 78\u2019s rocked ruggedly enough to offend any \u201cOpry\u201d purist.\n\nIn other words, the Ryman has been soiled. And saved. And my first night there was \u2014cover your ears, Rev. Jones \u2014 a hell of a show.\n\nWhitey Morgan and his band, the 78s, play Nashville's Ryman Auditorium.

On stage, guitarist Corey Dennison, 43, white and well tattooed, had just opened an instrumental conversation with a grandfatherly figure in a White Sox cap.\n\n\u201cThis is my old man, Mr. Carl Weathersby ,\u201d Dennison told the crowd. \u201cHe taught me everything I know about the blues.\u201d\n\nWeathersby, 65, and African American, nodded. The notes rose, fell and tangled like family voices around a dinner table. The players, related only by a passion for music, grinned and winced the way soloists do.\n\nIn the audience 100 blues lovers roared, clapped, drank and chattered in three or four languages.\n\nThis was Kingston Mines, the oldest, biggest club of its kind in Chicago, on a recent Monday night. Like the rest of the international audience, I was here to listen to an embattled American sound \u2014 Chicago-style electric blues, born in the mid-20th century as African American families moved north from the Mississippi Delta.\n\nIn that migration, legions of country blues musicians traded their acoustic guitars for electrics, started playing their harmonicas through microphones and launched an era of rough-edged, streetwise music, sibling to soul, cousin to gospel.\n\nThe sound filled mostly black clubs on Chicago\u2019s south and west sides. New arrivals played for tips on Maxwell Street, and the biggest names released albums on Chess Records and blazed a musical path that rock \u2019n\u2019 roll soon would follow.\n\nBut Chicago and pop culture have moved on. Though the vast, free Chicago Blues Festival takes over Millennium Park every June, and the locally headquartered Delmark and Alligator labels release new blues and roots tunes, rap music now dominates the South and West sides.\n\nYou must go to the Loop and north, where the tourists are, to find the remaining handful of all-blues clubs.\n\nI wanted to see and hear them before things changed any more, so I spent three days and nights this summer chasing Chicago blues through five clubs, one museum exhibition and one storied old studio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just real\u201d Corey Dennison\n\nSinger-guitarist Corey Dennison plays at Kingston Mines blues club in Chicago. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nKingston Mines, born in the late 1960s and a fixture on Halsted Street in Lincoln Park since 1982, was my first stop.\n\nAlthough the surrounding neighborhood is collegiate, urban and prosperous, the club aims for a rural juke-joint feel, with fried okra and catfish fingers on the menu, a map of \u201cblues country\u201d on the wall and tangles of Christmas lights here and there. It\u2019s too big to be called intimate, too gritty to be mistaken for a House of Blues .\n\nIt features two stages (so two bands can alternate sets without long delays in between) and a kitchen (Doc\u2019s Rib Joint). The live music plays until about 3:45 a.m. every night except Saturday into Sunday when it lasts an hour longer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pretty much no place I know like this on the planet,\u201d said Joanna Connor, a singer and guitarist who has played at the club for more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just real, man. It\u2019s real people,\u201d Dennison told me.\n\nSinger-guitarist Corey Dennison and veteran bluesman Carl Weathersby relax at Kingston Mines blues club in Chicago. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nDr. Lenin Pellegrino, a general practitioner and social crusader, owned the club for decades, relying on an audience that\u2019s a mix of locals, tourists and students from nearby DePaul University . \u201cDoc\u201d Pellegrino died in May at age 92. His grown children run the club.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an integrating force,\u201d manager Lisa Pellegrino told me. \u201cWe have people sitting here who, back home, their countries are at war.\u201d\n\nAs I chatted with the musicians between sets, I learned how Weathersby broke in as a guitarist for bluesmen Albert King and Billy Branch, started his own group, then hired Dennison and mentored him for years.\n\nNowadays Dennison and his band play two nights a week at Kingston Mines. Weathersby, who has moved out of state, had dropped by to listen.\n\nAs in all the clubs I checked out, the monthly schedule showed a mix of black and white performers, mostly homegrown. The audiences were probably less than 10% black and included a lot of blues-hungry visitors from Europe and Asia.\n\nMore than once, I thought of a question Chicago Tribune music critic Howard Reich posed in 2011: \u201cHow long can a black musical art form remain dynamic when presented to a largely white audience in settings designed to replicate and merchandise the real thing?\u201d\n\nI have no answer. But the music, done right, still thrills. Stories of loss and longing. Bursts of wild exhilaration. Moments of understanding that reach beyond age and race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s electric folk music,\u201d Bruce Iglauer, the Chicago-based founder of Alligator Records, told me. \u201cAnd folk music changes as the folks change.\u201d\n\nJ.W. Williams and his band play Kingston Mines, a blues club on Halsted Street in Chicago. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times Kingston Mines, a blues club on Chicago's Halsted Street in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, dates back to 1968. (Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times) Kingston Mines, a blues club on Chicago's Halsted Street in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, dates back to 1968. (Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times)\n\nWhatever the future, there is plenty of blues culture to see and hear this year in the city. At the Chicago History Museum, I browsed through the \u201cAmplified: Chicago Blues\u201d exhibition (through Aug. 10, 2019), which includes vintage photos of wild nights in long-gone South Side clubs; hands-on features inviting you to sing or play guitar (with the amp\u2019s distortion level set to good \u2019n\u2019 crunchy); and an introduction to many of the region\u2019s key players.\n\nFrom Mississippi came Muddy Waters to sing \u201cMannish Boy,\u201d Howlin\u2019 Wolf to sing \u201cSmokestack Lightnin\u2019,\u201d Bo Diddley to lay down the five-beat syncopated rhythm that drives \u201cWho Do You Love?,\u201d Willie Dixon to write \u201cHoochie Coochie Man\u201d and shape the Chicago blues scene for years as a bassist and producer.\n\nFrom Tennessee came Koko Taylor to sing \u201cWang Dang Doodle.\u201d From Louisiana came harmonica player Little Walter and guitarist Buddy Guy, now 82 and still performing at his club, Buddy Guy\u2019s Legends.\n\nSites and sounds: Visit iconic music venues throughout the country \u00bb\n\nA heaping of history\n\nMy other daytime stop was Willie Dixon\u2019s Blues Heaven Foundation, a surprisingly compact building that housed Chess Records from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s. There, tour guide Janine Judge led me upstairs to the studio where Waters, Diddley, Taylor and Dixon did some of their best work.\n\nThis was also where Chuck Berry recorded \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d in 1958 and Etta James recorded \u201cAt Last\u201d in 1960; where the Rolling Stones recorded a smoldering instrumental track titled \u201c2120 South Michigan Avenue\u201d in 1964 while on their first U.S. tour.\n\nJudge, carrying a portable speaker, cranked up the volume on classic songs and pointed out the late Dixon\u2019s old bass in one corner.\n\nWillie Dixon's Blues Heaven Foundation is where Chess Records used to be. Displays include life masks of blues greats, some living, some dead. Bobby Bland, seen here, died in 2013. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nShe explained how brothers Leonard and Phil Chess built the label and how Dixon sued Led Zeppelin decades ago, accusing the band of using his words and music in the songs \u201cBring It on Home\u201d and \u201cWhole Lotta Love.\u201d This led to settlement payments, amount undisclosed. Without that cash, who knows whether this building would still be standing?\n\nBy night I club-hopped, paying cover charges of $5 to $12.\n\nAt B.L.U.E.S. on Halsted, down the street from Kingston Mines, I stepped in just as host Big Ray was asking the out-of-towners where they were from (England, Hungary, Australia).\n\nThe club, snug and narrow, holds about 60 people. The stage was so small that the bass player sat on the keyboard of an upright piano.\n\nThis bar is known for musicians often sitting in \u2014 \u201cmore jamming, more surprises,\u201d Iglauer said \u2014 and many a music lover has spent an evening wandering back and forth between B.L.U.E.S. and Kingston Mines.\n\nAt Rosa\u2019s Lounge the scene is similarly intimate, and the hospitality has a homespun Italian inflection. Italian immigrant (and drummer) Tony Mangiullo opened the place in 1984, and it\u2019s been a fixture in the Logan Square neighborhood.\n\nI showed up on a slow weekday night \u2014 fewer than 10 customers were inside and nobody on the street outside. On stage, Nigel Mack, a singer and multi-instrumentalist, was working without his usual guitarist. That meant we didn\u2019t get the harmonica heroics Mack is known for, but I was happy to sit up close and admire his slide guitar work.\n\nRosa's Lounge is a longtime blues club in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago. Nigel Mack, who sings and plays slide guitar and harmonica, recently headlined. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe city\u2019s blues scene \u201cgoes up and it goes down,\u201d Mack told me during a break. \u201cBut the state of the blues has got to be healthier here than it is anywhere else in the world.\u201d\n\nAt Buddy Guy\u2019s Legends, a posh place next to the Hilton in the South Loop, I caught Mz Peachez and Her Casanovas.\n\nSitting in the palm of nature: The unique energy \u2014 and performances \u2014 of Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheatre \u00bb\n\nIf I were smarter, I\u2019d have arrived early enough to order dinner \u2014those who reserve ahead and sit to eat get the best spots. While I stood in back, Mz Peachez assessed her crowd and veered from standard blues titles to disco favorites \u201cBad Girls\u201d and \u201cI Will Survive.\u201d\n\nMaybe a few purists were offended, but dozens of Brazilian tourists jumped out of their seats to dance. (I\u2019m guessing that medley doesn\u2019t happen in January, when Guy himself usually does a month-long residency.)\n\nBuddy Guy's Legends has been a popular blues club in Chicago since its opening in 1989. Mz. Peachez and Her Casanovas played there on June 19. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nAt the House of Blues in the heavily touristed River North area, I was too early for live music but got a juicy burger with sweet potato fries. To those who would say that patronizing the House of Blues in Chicago is like eating at Taco Bell in Los Angeles, I can only say: Yes, it is. But it books a lot of local blues acts, often two per night.\n\nOn my last night in town, I circled back to Kingston Mines, where Dennison again was prowling the stage, singing Willie Nelson\u2019s lyrics about how \u201cthe nightlife ain\u2019t no good life, but it\u2019s my life.\u201d\n\nWeathersby was in the audience again, this time in a Cubs hat.\n\n\u201cThe things that blues are about \u2014 they aren\u2019t going away as long as there\u2019s people,\u201d he told me. With players such as Dennison on the scene, Weathersby added, \u201cIt\u2019s in good hands for another 20 years.\u201d\n\nThen up on stage, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 invited him to sit in, and the guitars started talking.\n\nIf you go\n\nThe best way to Chicago\n\nFrom LAX, United, American, Delta, Alaska and Frontier offer nonstop and connecting service (change of planes) to Chicago.

Singer Colin Meloy was on stage with the Decemberists, chatting up the audience.\n\n\u201cThere are very few places to play in the world that still make me nervous, and this is one of them,\u201d said Meloy, who has been touring for almost 20 years. \u201cIt feels like we should be giving a talk on grizzly bear management.\u201d\n\nRed Rocks, 16 miles southwest of downtown Denver, is an American outdoor music venue like no other.\n\nThe stage and audience areas are sheltered between a pair of 300-foot monoliths, Ship Rock and Creation Rock, and another boulder anchored behind the stage bounces sound forward. Whether you\u2019re in the audience or on stage, occupying Red Rocks is like being held in the palm of a vast sandstone hand.\n\nI recently caught two shows here and spent several more hours exploring the trails, slopes and meadows of Red Rocks Park, which covers 966 acres.\n\nIf you are a sonic purist, this might not be your place \u2014 too many visual distractions. But for the rest of us, it\u2019s a double thrill.\n\nIn the rocks you see nature improvising over the slow click-track of the long geological clock. On stage, there\u2019s a human invention every moment.\n\nAnd every once in a while, human and natural events align in startling ways.\n\nIn a video at the venue visitor center, Widespread Panic bassist Dave Schools recalls the day Red Rocks audience members roared their approval when he was in the middle of a song. Just as he was congratulating himself, he glanced up and realized that the fans were cheering a double rainbow overhead.\n\nBeyond the venue\n\nShow up at dawn, when the early light plays on the boulders, and the only music you\u2019ll hear at Red Rocks is birdsong.\n\nStill, you won\u2019t be alone. Besides the 1.3 million concertgoers it drew last year, Red Rocks also attracted an estimated 1.2 million tourists and hikers who never heard a note.\n\nThe park opens daily an hour before sunrise, and if there\u2019s no show that night it stays open until an hour after sunset. (The performance season is April through October.)\n\nFitness buffs huff and puff up and down the amphitheater aisles all year long, and wise ones keep their eyes open. Skunks, rattlesnakes and deer appear regularly.\n\nPeople gather to watch the sunrise from the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times) People walk the Geologic Overlook Trail, with Creation Rock in the background. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\nOn show days \u2014 which is almost every day in summer\u2014 the venue closes to visitors in early afternoon. But the trails stay busy, especially the Trading Post Trail.\n\nLou Spirito For The Times\n\nThat route covers 1.4 mostly flat miles through foliage and around rock formations. I encountered no critters on the path in the middle of a spring weekday, but I had plenty of human company, including Jennifer Forsha, a Littleton, Colo., resident who hikes the rocks almost every weekend with her husband and two kids.\n\n\u201cWe run up the trail and we run up the amphitheater,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see all this beautiful stuff. And if you go up to the amphitheater, it\u2019s a bunch of amazing energy.\u2026 It\u2019s my happy place.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll never know who first made music among the boulders. But historians say the site was a longtime gathering point for native people. And we know that by 1906, a promoter named John Brisben Walker had bought the property, named it the Garden of the Titans and set up a wooden platform.\n\nIf you go up to the amphitheater, it\u2019s a bunch of amazing energy.\u2026 It\u2019s my happy place.\u201d Jennifer Forsha\n\nPietro Satriano and his 25-piece brass band played that May. Five years later, soprano Mary Garden sang opera.\n\nIn years to follow, Walker staged all sorts of events in the area and built a funicular railway, later scrapped.\n\nThe city of Denver acquired the amphitheater site in 1927, and architect Burnham Hoyt came up with the plans. Civilian Conservation Corps workers, grateful for work in the middle of the Great Depression, started swinging picks and shovels in 1936 or 1937, often earning $1 per day.\n\nBy 1941, the workers had sculpted the space between Ship and Creation rocks into 70 rows for wooden benches, the aisles flanked by juniper trees. Then, as now, there was room for about 9,500 people.\n\nThe rock amphitheater outside of Denver is a music venue and a place to hike.\n\nThe visitor center, open to concertgoers and sightseers alike, was added in 2007. There\u2019s room for the Ship Rock Grille and a Red Rocks artists\u2019 hall of fame. There\u2019s also a Colorado Music Hall of Fame in the Trading Post building, with a bronze statue in front of \u2014 did you guess it? \u2014 John Denver.\n\nMeanwhile, performers enjoy dressing rooms built around rock formations. In the tunnel between the sound-mixing board and backstage, generations of musicians have made their marks. (Styx, it seems, travels with a stencil.)\n\nThrough the early 1950s, the schedule was short and dominated by classical music, opera and ballet, with each season opened by an Easter sunrise service.\n\nThen pop culture crept in.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Jerry Lewis was doing stand-up, Ella Fitzgerald was scat-singing and Ricky Nelson was playing. Ray Charles appeared in 1962 but did such a short, slapdash show that the audience pelted the stage with beer cans and management briefly imposed an alcohol ban.\n\nThe Beatles played in 1964 (leaving about 2,500 tickets unsold at $6.60 each). Jimi Hendrix came in 1968. When Jethro Tull appeared in 1971, legions of ticket-less fans tried to breach a fence, security forces let loose with tear gas and a five-year rock \u2019n\u2019 roll ban began.\n\nFans listen as Phantogram/Tycho performs at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nBy the late \u201970s, the amphitheater was again busy with rock and just about every other genre. In 1978 Steve Martin brought down the house with \u201cKing Tut,\u201d a performance audible on his album \u201cA Wild and Crazy Guy.\u201d\n\nFive years later, a young U2 played amid fog and rain, a show featured in the film \u201cU2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky.\u201d\n\nAni DiFranco has sung about reproductive freedom here, John Tesh about God. The Moody Blues crooned \u201cNights in White Satin\u201d with the Colorado Symphony providing full orchestral pomp. On April 20, 2014, Red Rocks began its day with an Easter sunrise service and ended with a Snoop Dogg show.\n\n\u201cI did 37 shows last year,\u201d usher Ben Miller, 33, told me one night. \u201cEvery show definitely does have a different energy to it.\u201d His favorite performance: the alternative band Gorillaz last September.\n\n\u201cIt was raining most of the time, but sometimes that makes a better show,\u201d Miller said.\n\nIf you sit in Row 33 or higher, you can see the horizon beyond the stage, but it sometimes gets windy. Lightning or hail occasionally forces a delay or cancellation. And because the stage is about 6,450 feet above sea level, performers sometimes come up short of breath. The crew keeps oxygen canisters backstage.\n\nHigh-energy music\n\nDon\u2019t miss the year-by-year timeline of performers when you browse the visitor center. You\u2019ll notice that the venue gets busier as the economy booms and slower when it slumps (the early 1990s and late 2000s, for instance). As recently as 2012, the Red Rocks performance year included just 78 concerts.\n\nBut it\u2019s booming now, with 161 nights booked for this year\u2014 including about 30 nights of EDM \u2014 electronic dance music. Just as jam bands such as the Grateful Dead, Blues Traveler and Widespread Panic played a key role at Red Rocks in the \u201990s and \u201900s, EDM shows have multiplied lately. In fact, those shows\u2019 thundering bass lines have prompted new volume limits.\n\nA display of every act that has performed at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times) Posters for acts that have played at the amphitheatre line a wall. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cThe crowd is very high energy,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of drug use.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Red Rocks spokesman Brian Kitts about that, he suggested that every new generation of pop music seems to provoke a similar set of complaints. In the larger picture, he said, \u201cI have a hard time believing that having EDM is any different than having Metallica on stage.\u201d\n\nJust my luck \u2014 I missed EDM and Metallica. But I did catch Phantogram, a rock band that favors electronica, often slips into spacey dance grooves and uses lots of light effects and projections. In short, this was a marijuana-friendly band. (Though weed is banned from the amphitheater, enforcement is imperfect.) The house was packed, happy and mostly younger than 30.\n\nThere are very few places to play in the world that still make me nervous, and this is one of them.\u201d Colin Meloy\n\nColin Meloy of the Decemberists during a performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nI returned the next night for the Decemberists. It was a smaller crowd, mostly older than 30 and many older than 50, like me. But from the opening notes of \u201cEverything Is Awful\u201d \u2014 the band\u2019s first song \u2014 it was a happy night.\n\nI joined in when the audience rose and started calling for an encore. For a long neo-tribal moment we all stood clapping, glancing at each other, the boulders and the sky.\n\nThen the band was back, dragging a mysterious canister. Meloy pointed at it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough oxygen for one more!\u201d he shouted.\n\nNear Red Rocks\n\nStroll tiny downtown Morrison (population about 430), which lies two miles southeast of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Have a look at Bear Creek, see the old white Morrison Chapel and browse the shops along Bear Creek Avenue, the main street.\n\nTry breakfast or lunch at the Cow an Eatery. Before you head to a show at Red Rocks, maybe have a game dinner at the Fort.\n\nAlso, stop in at the Buffalo Bill Museum & Grave on Lookout Mountain, which celebrates the life and times of outdoorsman and showman Buffalo Bill Cody (1846-1917). The museum features Wild West show posters and artifacts. As for the gift shop\u2014 you\u2019ve never seen so many refrigerator magnets.\n\nA coffee shop in the tiny town of Morrison, Colo. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nGolden, 8 miles north of the amphitheater, is another worthwhile town near Red Rocks. It\u2019s best known for the Coors Brewery, and, yes, there are tours.\n\nBut you may prefer to walk Washington Street and admire the \u201cHowdy Folks!\u201d sign overhead. Check out the path along Clear Creek, where there are often kayakers. Try the pizza at Woody\u2019s Wood-Fired Pizza. If you like, eat it at a picnic table on the bridge over Clear Creek.\n\nThe Origin Hotel is supposed to open by the end of the summer. Rates start at $212, dipping to $169 in November. (It was still a construction site when I visited.)\n\nIf you go\n\nTHE BEST WAY TO DENVER\n\nFrom LAX, American, United, Delta, Alaska, Frontier and Southwest offer nonstop service to Denver, and American, Delta, United, Southwest and Alaska offer connecting service (change of planes). Restricted round-trip airfare from $151, including taxes and fees.\n\nWHERE TO EAT\n\nThe Cow an Eatery, 316 Bear Creek Ave., Morrison, Colo.; (303) 697-5721. This casual place has a pleasant patio and is popular for breakfast and lunch. Most main dishes $8-$15.\n\nThe Fort, 19192 Highway 8, Morrison; Colo.; (303) 697-4771. It\u2019s a re-creation of an early 19th century fort. Most steaks cost $40-$64. Bison, beef and quail are specialties. (I had the bison sirloin fixed-price combo with potatoes, greens and quail for $39.) Nice views and fire pits on the patio.\n\nWoody\u2019s Wood-fired Pizza, 1305 Washington Ave., Golden, Colo.; (303) 277-0443. Good pizza, festive atmosphere, and a novelty: Diners are encouraged to pour a dollop of local honey on their crusts. Most pizzas $12-$23.\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nThe Crawford Hotel, Union Station, 1701 Wynkoop St., Denver; (720) 460-3700. Opened in 2014. This 112-room hotel was created using office and attic space within the city\u2019s historic train station. Doubles from $361, plus $20 nightly \u201cdestination amenity fee.\u201d\n\nCourtyard Denver West/Golden, 14700 W. 6th Ave. Frontage Road, Golden, Colo.; (303) 271-0776. Doubles from $130 in summer months.\n\nCliff House Lodge B&B, 121 Stone St., Morrison, Colo.; (303) 697-9732. A rustic, casual compound that includes one 1873 building. Nine rooms in eight cottages, some with kitchenettes, fireplaces and whirlpool tubs. Rates $200-$390.\n\nTO LEARN MORE\n\nRed Rocks Amphitheatre.

Expect to see millions in campaign donations pour in, a fair share of attack ads and lots of chatter about President Trump .\n\nFor Cox, the path to victory is formidable. The Rancho Santa Fe businessman has never been elected to public office, despite several tries. Cox is not well known in California, and no Republican has won a statewide race in California since 2006. Democrats have a 19-percentage-point edge over Republicans in voter registration and, as of May, the GOP trailed behind Californians registered as \u201cNo Party Preference.\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s biggest coup in the primary race was nabbing the endorsement of President Trump. That helped him consolidate the Republican vote, assisting his rise to second place in the primary \u2014 but Trump\u2019s nod likely will hurt him in November. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton crushed Trump by more than 4.2 million votes in California in the 2016 presidential election .\n\nNewsom faces potential pitfalls as well. The Democrat has defended the gas tax and vehicle fee increases approved by the state Legislature and Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown . Funds from the increases will pay for much-needed transportation infrastructure projects in California, but the hikes are unpopular among voters. A statewide ballot measure to repeal the gas tax appears headed to the November ballot, and that may help Cox, who is chairman of the repeal campaign.\n\nCalifornia also has the nation\u2019s highest effective poverty rate, an affordable housing crisis and has seen a rapid increase of homelessness. Newsom has acknowledged that the Democrats \u201cown\u201d those problems since they\u2019ve been in power, and Cox already said those issues will be the foundation of his attacks against the lieutenant governor.\n\n\u201cGiven the party registration in this state, it looks very good for Newsom,\u201d San Jose State political scientist Melinda Jackson said. \u201cI hesitate to say it\u2019d be a cakewalk because people thought that Trump would be a very weak candidate against Hillary Clinton and look what happened. Never say never.\u201d\n\nJohn Cox\n\nRepublican John Cox Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nTop jobs: Businessman and real estate investor\n\nBiggest splash: Cox was endorsed by Trump.\n\nBaggage: He\u2019s lost each of his previous campaigns for public office.\n\nParticulars: Cox, 62, lives in Rancho Santa Fe and is married with four children. He is a graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago and earned a law degree at Chicago Kent College at the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nThe venture capitalist announced his gubernatorial bid in early March 2017. He has contributed millions of his own money to fund his campaign.\n\nAlthough this is the first time Cox has run for public office in California, he is not a newcomer to campaigns. He ran for president in 2008, bowing out after failing to get any traction. When he lived in Illinois, Cox ran for the House and twice for the U.S. Senate , including a race against Barack Obama.

When the mercury fell below 28, juicy oranges turned dry and tasteless.

(Nina Prommer/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nFirst of all, how are you feeling right now, just a few days out from the show, and what\u2019s kept you sane through the roller coaster of it all?\n\nGigliotti: Well, if you could see us, we look remarkably healthy and fresh-faced and there are no bags under our eyes. I\u2019m serious \u2014 don\u2019t laugh. Because we think the show is in good shape.\n\nAnd how did I stay sane? I didn\u2019t read any press. I still have not. And I will hold to that until 8 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nWeiss: And part of keeping sane is keeping, so to speak, your eye on the prize. At the end of the day, we\u2019re producing an entertaining and moving and flowing show \u2014 with all the changes that came along, we kept working on achieving that goal.\n\nThe first major obstacle to get over was when Kevin Hart dropped out as host. How did you pivot from there? It\u2019s been 30 years since the Oscars has had no formal host. Did you immediately see that there could be some upside to going that route?\n\nGigliotti: First of all, I\u2019m going to say this in all honesty: Glenn and I did have a conversation very early on about the possibility of going hostless, and I have notes to prove that. That goes back to the beginning of October. We did have that conversation.\n\nAnd part of the reason we had that conversation was, you know, we were entrusted with doing a three-hour show. Well, go back and look at what takes up \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean this in a bad way \u2014 but a host does eat up a fair amount of time. It\u2019s one of the reasons we had the conversation about the possibility. So after Kevin Hart, the pivot was pretty easy, because we\u2019d had the conversation already.\n\nWeiss: And it\u2019s true that it\u2019s been 30 years since the Oscars have been hostless, but other shows have done it and done it recently. It\u2019s happened on the Globes. It\u2019s happened on the Grammys. It\u2019s happened on the Tonys. And it\u2019s something that Donna and I thought was eminently doable as a potential scenario, going back to the beginning.\n\nIs there an overarching theme to the show this year \u2014 and if there is, how did you arrive at that?\n\nGigliotti: If there is a theme \u2014 and I think there is \u2014 it\u2019s about movies as an empathetic art form. Movies connect people. Movies bring people together. Movies have cultural importance. That\u2019s sort of our theme, which we take a lot from the films themselves \u2014 \u201cBlack Panther\u201d being a perfectly good example of this, where there are a lot of people who saw \u201cBlack Panther\u201d who now understand something about black culture they didn\u2019t understand before.\n\nA few days ago, you made the big announcement that Queen is performing, and there\u2019s been speculation that they\u2019ll be opening the show. What was the thinking about having them perform along with the nominated songs? There have been years when the songs haven\u2019t been performed at all. How did you arrive at the songs plus Queen?\n\nGigliotti: Glenn and I talked about Queen early on \u2014 and we can tell you that Queen are going to open the broadcast.\n\nHow did we come to that decision? Well, you have to look at the fact that this is a movie [\u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d] that has done in excess of $800 million worldwide business. Japan alone is $100 million. We are putting on a show for a worldwide audience. So Queen is kind of a natural for us. I mean, don\u2019t you want to be at rehearsals when Queen are rehearsing? It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s fantastic.\n\nWeiss: And again, adding to all the statistics Donna just quoted about the worldwide appeal, just opening the show with that kind of energy and known music and excitement allows us to start this in a different way, and we think it\u2019s really good to just jump right in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonna, at the Oscar nominees luncheon, you referenced Steven Soderbergh\u2019s acceptance speech for directing \u201cTraffic\u201d as being sort of a model of a great, pithy, emotional speech. He has since said that he thinks that\u2019s hilarious, because he was drunk and winging it because he didn\u2019t expect to win. Did you hear that he said that \u2014 and what\u2019s your reaction?\n\nGigliotti: I didn\u2019t know that. I also don\u2019t actually believe him. I think that is young Mr. Soderbergh being glib. I think that he does not really want to admit that he was very moved and that he gave a moving speech. That\u2019s what I honestly think.\n\nAnd you know what? If I think back to that year, which was 2001, I\u2019m pretty sure that you still had to pay cash at the bar. Drinks were not free. So now I doubly don\u2019t believe him, because I don\u2019t know that he had cash money in his pocket. [laughs]\n\nI\u2019ll have to go back to him now. This is going to going to be a new controversy.\n\nGigliotti: [laughs] You don\u2019t mean that, do you?\n\nNo, I\u2019m joking.\n\nGigliotti: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nOnce the decision was made to reinstate the awards for cinematography, editing, live action short and hairstyling and makeup from the commercial breaks back into the show, how much had to change and how logistically difficult was that to pull off so late in the game?\n\nWeiss: Let me start by saying this: I do a lot of live shows, as you may or may not know. The run-down is never set four weeks before the show when nominations come out. And I think part of the whole art and the process of what we do on these shows is building and changing with new information and with the times.\n\nWere some that happened this year big curveballs? Maybe. But that\u2019s kind of part of the process of building a live show. As information is coming in and pieces change, the idea is to build as exciting and as well-flowing a show as you can, and I think we kept to that. I\u2019m not sure it was an excessive curveball. It was a curveball.\n\nGigliotti: The truth is, you produce live television, you produce movies \u2014 there\u2019s always something that comes up. You deal with it, is what it amounts to.\n\nEvery year, the Oscars are scrutinized incredibly closely, and there\u2019s always a lot of armchair-quarterbacking, but given everything that\u2019s led up to this particular show, there may be even more than usual. How are you going to measure the show\u2019s success? Is it about the ratings at the end of the day or is it about something bigger and less quantifiable?\n\nGigliotti: How will we measure success? I don\u2019t know. I think ratings are one way of measuring success. I think that how my peers in the room react to the show is a measure of success. And I think that if the academy is pleased with our work, that too will be a measure of success. So it\u2019s a lot of different things.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-doctors-opioid-arrests-20190221-story.html", "text": "\u201cAs we battle the traditional drug trafficking organizations, we cannot lose sight of fact that some in the medical community are stoking the fires and helping to deepen this crisis,\u201d said U.S. Atty.

They landed in the port city of Keelung right before the Dragon Boat Festival, where they bought bananas and zongzi, glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo leaves, from Taiwanese people.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have known that we wouldn\u2019t come back. We were just living one day at a time,\u201d You-nian recalled, sitting in a wrinkled green armchair in his Taipei apartment. On the wall, a world map with a Republic of China flag hung next to a collage of family photos. He opened a leather album of black-and-white snapshots. The first page contained small photos of a younger You-nian surrounding a larger portrait of Chiang Kai-shek in full military regalia.\n\n\u201cI adore him,\u201d You-nian said. He said he has voted for Chiang\u2019s Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, his entire life, and he served in the army until he was 70. By then, he was a lieutenant colonel.\n\nAn old photograph of Mei You-nian with his wife, Tsai-hui, hangs in their Taipei home. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nMei You-nian met his wife, Tsai-hui, while stationed in Penghu, a smaller island in the Taiwan Strait, and married at age 30. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nYou-nian met his wife while stationed in Penghu, a smaller island in the Taiwan Strait, and married at age 30. She was benshengren, a native Taiwanese descended from ethnic Chinese who had inhabited Taiwan since before Japan took over the island in 1895. Her family resisted their marriage initially, seeing You-nian as an outsider, but relented in the end. Their son Heng-han was born in 1964, between an older and a younger sister.\n\nGrowing up, Mei Heng-han said he took for granted that he was Chinese. \u201cWe were brainwashed to be Chinese. We called ourselves Taiwan province,\u201d he said.\n\nTaiwan was then under martial law, with harsh restrictions on press, speech, assembly and formation of new political parties. The ruling Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all of China, including the mainland, while the Communist Party in Beijing claimed the same.\n\nIn Taiwan\u2019s schools, class workbooks were printed with the imperative to \u201cBe a happy, lively student; be a proper, upright Chinese person.\u201d\n\nHeng-han\u2019s wife, who is also a benshengren, wasn\u2019t allowed to speak Hokkien, a dialect of Chinese spoken by descendants of Fujianese immigrants who\u2019d come to Taiwan during the Qing Dynasty. Their history wasn\u2019t taught in schools.\n\nMei Heng-han, the son of Mei You-nian, poses for a photo in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Growing up, Heng-han said he took for granted that he was Chinese. \u201cWe were brainwashed to be Chinese. We called ourselves Taiwan province,\u201d he said. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nIn 1989, after finishing university and army service, Heng-han went to study computer science in New Jersey. There, Americans asked him where he was from. He\u2019d say, \u201cTaiwan,\u201d and they\u2019d reply, \u201cOh, China.\u201d He\u2019d repeat, \u201cI\u2019m Taiwanese,\u201d and they\u2019d say, \u201cOh, Chinese.\u201d For the first time, Heng-han felt indignant that the rest of the world didn\u2019t seem to know Taiwan was different.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan was changing. In 1987, martial law was lifted. Suddenly, it was safe to speak Taiwanese dialects such as Hokkien, to criticize the Kuomintang, to have opposition parties and to mobilize civil society.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201990s, society changed. People started to discuss national identity, Taiwanese independence, democratic transition,\u201d said Chang Tieh-chih, deputy secretary-general of Taiwan\u2019s General Assn. of Chinese Culture. \u201cYou had social movements at every level, in communities, among aboriginal people, with labor unions \u2014 the original values were really challenged.\u201d\n\nOne of the major reforms took place in education. Taiwanese schools added a Taiwan-centric history curriculum, starting with 400 years of Taiwan\u2019s history, before and after 1949. Previous textbooks had focused on Chinese history, tracing a line from China\u2019s imperial dynasties to the 1911 Xinhai Revolution to the Kuomintang loss in 1949. Taiwan had been a postscript. Now it was the main subject.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a paradigm change,\u201d Chang said.\n\nShayne Mei, son of Mei Heng-han, walks with his girlfriend, Daphne Chiu, at National Taiwan University in Taipei. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nIn 1995, Mei Heng-han\u2019s son Shayne was born. He grew up in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, but then went to Taipei, the capital, to study foreign languages and literature at National Taiwan University. Shayne met his girlfriend, Daphne Chiu, on campus. They wear rainbow bracelets to support marriage equality and speak English with perfect accents, his British, hers American. For them, Taiwanese independence is a given, along with social values such as LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cWe think about China all the time. It\u2019s a threat, a bully, something we\u2019ll have to avoid,\u201d Shayne said.\n\nIsolation-wary, Chinese-speaking Taiwan moves to make English an official language \u00bb\n\nShayne and Daphne were both too young to vote in 2016 (the voting age is 20 in Taiwan), when pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen was elected. But they participated in November\u2019s midterm election and referendum. Referendum topics included whether to recognize same-sex marriage and whether Taiwan should compete as \u201cTaiwan\u201d instead of \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d in the Olympics. Both were rejected.\n\nShayne was shocked. He\u2019d thought he knew exactly how people would vote.\n\n\u201cI feel confused. I\u2019m losing this sense of self-identity and belonging. All these people, they don\u2019t even agree on what country we are,\u201d he said.\n\nTaiwanese had been convinced by media claims that their athletes would get shut out of the Olympics if they angered China by changing their competition name, Shayne said, which just showed how emotional and easily manipulated his compatriots were.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just cowards,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel really powerless.\u201d\n\nDaphne didn\u2019t understand how people could fail to empathize with the gay community. To her, it was a moral imperative to support equal rights; she couldn\u2019t fathom how other voters could see same-sex marriage as a matter of opinion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really depressed and disappointed about Taiwanese people. That\u2019s why I want to leave here,\u201d she said. Both are applying for graduate school in the United States.\n\nShayne Mei and his girlfriend, Daphne Chiu, wear rainbow bracelets to support marriage equality and speak English with perfect accents, his British, hers American. For them, Taiwanese independence is a given, along with social values such as LGBT and women\u2019s rights. An Rong Xu / For The Times\n\nChang Mau-kuei, a sociologist at Taiwan\u2019s national academy, Academia Sinica, pointed out that identity is a product of lived experience, which can vary so widely between different generations that they exist in disparate worlds. One factor influencing Taiwanese identity has been the experience of meeting mainland Chinese people, which was only possible after 1987, the year Taiwan and China began permitting cross-strait visits.\n\n\u201cUntil 1987, Taiwanese couldn\u2019t see any mainland Chinese. In propaganda, they were Communist, \u2018bad Chinese,\u2019\u201d Chang said. \u201cThen, they met! Suddenly you see real Chinese, good and bad, relatives or not, employees, bosses, marriages \u2014 a separate identity emerged from interaction. The more you interact, the more you find you are different.\u201d\n\nIn 1991, Mei You-nian went back to Anhui, only to find that his parents and siblings had starved to death during China\u2019s 1960s famine. He knelt at his family\u2019s grave, weeping, when he found out. The Chinese relatives called You-nian uncle, and he felt at home. He filled a bottle with Anhui soil and brought it back to Taipei.\n\nIn 2001, Mei Heng-han went to Anhui with his father. He added some of his distant relatives on WeChat, and ordered a gift from Taobao , an online shopping site, when one of their sons got married. Otherwise, they rarely talked.\n\nHe\u2019s also been to China on state-sponsored business tours encouraging Taiwanese investment in Fujian, the closest mainland province to Taiwan. His main impression was that China develops quickly, but is rife with scams. Heng-han has stopped calling himself Chinese, except when doing business with Chinese people.\n\nShayne has never been to Anhui. His grandfather gave him a red packet of money when he graduated in 2018, saying he wanted him to get a doctorate, and then he\u2019d bring his grandson to the village and show him off. Shayne cringed at the idea. \u201cI\u2019m getting a master\u2019s, not a PhD, and then I\u2019m going to work in tech,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019d visit Anhui if his grandfather really wanted, though.\n\nalice.su@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @aliceysu"}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-parkland-fathers-20190213-story.html#nt=barker", "text": "\u201cSo you and I are now eye to eye,\u201d Guttenberg told him. \u201cLook at me and tell me guns were the factor in the hunting of our kids in this school this week!

Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nNinety years ago, the lamps illuminated one of the most breathtaking living rooms in L.A. The residence belonged to Samuel Freeman and his dancer wife, Harriet, an avant-garde couple who had commissioned Wright to turn a steep and narrow plot in the Hollywood Hills into a showplace.\n\nThe architect, already famous and enjoying a midlife sojourn in California, ringed the living room with tall windows that provided dramatic views down Highland Avenue and of the surrounding hills.\n\nThe furniture he fashioned for the room included the 6-foot-high cast iron and glass lamps. His protege, Schindler, later worked on the house, adding his own unique furnishings.\n\nFor decades, the Freemans\u2019 eclectic crowd of artists, scientists and leftists savored the home and its decor. \u201cCasablanca\u201d actor Claude Rains was a regular at the couple\u2019s so-called salons, and Harriet Freeman feted legendary choreographer Martha Graham at a dinner party in the living room.\n\nSamuel Freeman died in the living room in 1981. Harriet suffered a stroke and spent her final months in a bed in the living room. She died in 1986. Childless, they left the home and furniture to USC, hoping the university would treasure the property as a site for meetings, classes and historic preservation.\n\nThe patterned cement blocks from the Freeman House. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright designed the house in the early 20th century. Los Angeles Times\n\nPreservationists quickly learned that maintaining the Freemans\u2019 home, like other Wright designs in L.A., would be a major challenge. The residence\u2019s hallmark \u2014 patterned cement-block walls that recalled Mayan temples \u2014 proved uniquely unsuited for California\u2019s seismic environment.\n\nThe Freeman House suffered severe structural damage in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Tiles tumbled from the house and broke. It took the university years to secure more than $1 million in restoration funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other sources.\n\nAround 2000, in advance of the work, USC moved the contents of the home, including the Wright and Schindler furniture, to the architecture school\u2019s rented warehouse. The brick facility on 24th Street, formerly a city power station, has a cavernous interior with at least one separate, locked room.\n\nSome broken tiles were stored in the main room while the furniture was placed in the locked area, according to people familiar with the warehouse. For the next decade, the pieces that had delighted the Freemans and their guests would sit in the dark, glimpsed only occasionally by USC faculty, staff and students.\n\nThe Freeman House in 1998 was supported by braces and had a tent over its roof after the Northridge earthquake. Bob Carey / Los Angeles Times\n\nA 1998 photograph shows damage to a wall at back of the Freeman House. Bob Carey / Los Angeles Times\n\nA facilities staffer visiting the warehouse in September 2012 noticed items missing from the locked room.\n\nThere was no sign of a break-in or vandalism, and nothing but the Wright and Schindler furniture seemed to have been taken.\n\nKenneth Breisch, an associate professor who oversaw the graduate program in historic preservation, said that as far as he knew, there was only one key to the room and it was maintained by the facilities department.\n\nThe staffer who had discovered the missing items contacted Breisch to see whether he knew anything. Told no, the staffer said he planned to alert campus police, according to Breisch.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\n\u201cI just assumed they were taking care of it,\u201d said Breisch, who declined to name the staffer. \u201cI just assumed, I think, that it probably didn\u2019t consist of anything of value, [otherwise] I would have heard more.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the stolen floor lamps and chair had significant value. The lamps are particularly rare and coveted by collectors. A nearly identical piece Wright made in the same period for a Hollywood Boulevard residence sold at auction two years ago for $100,000.\n\nTold of the lamps\u2019 theft recently, architect and author Thomas A. Heinz, the foremost expert in Wright\u2019s interiors, exclaimed, \u201cWow. Wow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause these are so rare, I would say it\u2019s a tremendous loss,\u201d said Heinz, adding that Wright created about a dozen such lamps.\n\nSchindler\u2019s chairs are also in demand. Last July, two of the architect\u2019s redwood \u201csling\u201d chairs were reported stolen from an Olympic Boulevard storage unit rented by the Friends of the Schindler House, the nonprofit that maintains the architect\u2019s former West Hollywood residence.\n\nBoard member Robert Sweeney told the police the chairs were original to the Kings Road landmark and estimated their value at $25,000 each.\n\nDespite the clear value of the items taken, no one at USC filed a report with campus police, LAPD or the university\u2019s insurance carriers. Word of the theft circulated among some at the architecture school, but few, if any, outsiders were told.\n\nIt remained a secret until last summer when someone\u2019s conscience appeared to have been prodded by a listing at a Chicago auction. The listing described the lot for sale as a \u201ctextile block from the Samuel Freeman House, Los Angeles\u201d and identified the seller as a private collector in Chicago. It was a 16-inch square, the size of the original Freeman blocks, and had discolorations indicating decades in the elements. It sold for $5,000 in June.\n\nWeeks after its sale, The Times received an anonymous email describing the warehouse theft. The author also included a link to the auction and wrote that even if the sale was not connected to the theft, it was troubling. How could the tile have fallen into private hands when its ownership had passed directly from the Freemans to USC, the writer asked.\n\nThe building in South Los Angeles from which the pieces were stolen. Patrick Fallon /For The Los Angeles Times\n\nThe Times approached USC about the alleged theft in mid-January. A university spokeswoman expressed skepticism, saying that even the most minor infractions are documented by the campus police and shared with administrators. It strained credulity, she said, that a suspected felony involving priceless works of art had gone unreported.\n\nA search of campus police databases and inquiries to half a dozen employees turned up nothing about a theft, she said. But further investigation by USC\u2019s Office of Professionalism and Ethics, a new unit set up after recent scandals, determined that the tip had merit.\n\nOn Jan. 22, campus police filed a report with the LAPD, identifying the three missing items. The university blamed the 6\u00bd-year delay in contacting authorities on a miscommunication between employees, according to police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite alarming, frankly, that there\u2019s a gap,\u201d said Lt. Perry Griffith of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Southwest station, who reviewed the report before handing it off to the department\u2019s Art Theft Detail.\n\nIn a statement, USC said it was fully cooperating with the police probe and pursuing its own internal investigation.\n\n\u201cThe university is reviewing its procedures and security measures related to the Freeman House and its assets,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement. She added that the university \u201cis working with its risk management team on the insurance claim process.\u201d\n\nLAPD Det. Don Hrycyk of the art theft unit said his investigation was at the preliminary stage.\n\n\u201cThere was no forced entry, so it looks like someone who had access to a key,\u201d Hrycyk said.\n\nUSC declined to identify those with access to the room and said in a statement, \u201cIt appears unlikely that there was only one key, however we expect that to be part of the investigation.\u201d\n\nThe passage of time had made dusting for fingerprints and other forensic techniques all but impossible. Memories have faded, and witnesses are out of reach.\n\n\u201cA lot of these people are no longer at USC,\u201d Hrycyk said.\n\nThe tile auctioned in Chicago is not part of the LAPD investigation, he said. USC said it had \u201cno verification\u201d as to whether it was stolen from the house.\n\nJeffrey Chusid, a Cornell University professor who is a leading authority on the Freeman House, said the auctioned tile appeared to be an original. Chusid, who lived in the house when he taught at USC in the 1980s and 1990s, said it was unlikely to be one that fell from the home during the earthquake because those were largely broken. During the 1990s, a vandal pried a tile from the street-side of the house, he said, \u201cand that might be floating around.\u201d\n\nRichard Wright, the president of the Chicago auction house, said the seller told him he obtained the piece several years ago from a dealer. Wright said he believed that the tile was originally from the Freeman House\u2019s garage and that it was removed after the 1994 earthquake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that there was some restoration done to the house,\u201d Wright said. \u201cGiven the not-great condition, it had been a tile that had been replaced.\u201d\n\nWright said the collector who consigned the tile had attested to the legal title of the concrete block. Still, he said that in the world of art auctions, \u201cit is not always perfectly clear how things get out.\u201d\n\nThe USC School of Architecture at the university's South L.A. campus. Patrick T.

Tijuana was what experts refer to as a trampoline, a strategic border point used to vault drugs north.\n\nThen, after 9/11, the deadliest attack by foreign terrorists on American soil, the U.S. began to invest billions in border security.\n\nNew surveillance technologies and a doubling of the number of Border Patrol staff made it much harder to smuggle drugs into the U.S.\n\nIndustrious traffickers responded by digging tunnels under the border and packing more vehicles with smaller shipments of drugs, knowing that many would get caught but some would get through.\n\nCrucially, traffickers also began offloading some of their product in Tijuana, paying local affiliates in drugs, which wound up on the streets for sale.\n\nCartels still prized trafficking routes to the U.S., but Tijuana emerged as a fledgling new market.\n\nIts substance of choice was cristal, which the cartels began making in larger quantities when the U.S. passed new restrictions on the sale of over-the-counter medicines that contain precursor chemicals.\n\nCristal offered a cheap high, and for many Tijuana residents who came from other parts of the country to work in the city\u2019s hundreds of low-slung border factories known as maquiladoras, a way to cope with the loneliness of living far from home.\n\nPublic health officials started noticing a rise in meth addiction about a decade ago. Today, nearly 3% of people in the state of Baja California, or about 100,000 people, say they have used the drug, more than any state in Mexico, according to a study by the federal government.\n\nDealers are aggressive in recruiting potential customers.\n\nIn the poor hillside neighborhood known as El Florido, men on street corners call out to Antonio Zambrano \u2014 a Catholic priest in a clerical collar \u2014 if he goes out after dark, offering hits of cristal.\n\n\u2018One gets used to living among the bullets.\u2019 Antonio Zambrano, priest\n\nTwo years ago, a junkie tried to burglarize Zambrano\u2019s humble parish and stabbed him with a screwdriver.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Tijuana offered him the opportunity to move to a new church, but Zambrano chose to stay, citing the community\u2019s \u201cspiritual need.\u201d Each month he presides over several drug-related funerals.\n\n\u201cOne gets used to living among the bullets,\u201d he said.\n\nA losing battle to save lives\n\nSirens wailing, paramedic Juan Carlos Mendez sped through the barren foothills of eastern Tijuana, past garbage dumps and dirt roads lined with crumbling concrete shacks.\n\nHe turned his vehicle down a small lane, where a crowd pointed him toward an abandoned house covered in graffiti. Mendez grabbed his medical bag and broke into a sprint.\n\nBehind the house, in a dusty alley, lay a young man dressed in shorts and dirty sneakers. Flies circled a pool of blood that had seeped from his head onto the sand.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Mendez said, panting.\n\nAs a supervisor with the Tijuana Red Cross, Mendez is trained to save lives. But in just over an hour that day last summer, he declared three young men dead.\n\nTijuana Red Cross responds to the scene of a homicide where a roughly 35-year-old man was shot in the back of the head.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)\n\nGrowing up here in the 1980s, Mendez used to stay out late playing in the streets, coming in only if there was a San Diego Padres baseball game on television.\n\nToday, grisly images from homicide scenes \u2014 which he documents as part of his job \u2014 are stored on his cellphone alongside photographs of his family. There is his curly haired 4-year-old daughter at a birthday party. There is a body burned beyond recognition. There is his wife, smiling in a dress. There is a corpse in a ditch.\n\nBack at Red Cross headquarters that night, just after Mendez asked a friend for a pill to soothe his stomach ulcers, the radio on his hip squawked to life.\n\n\u201cCinco bravo,\u201d a dispatcher said. The code for a gunshot wound.\n\nBehind the story: How The Times reported on Tijuana's massive rise in homicides \u00bb\n\nIn a poor neighborhood not far from the border, Mendez found a shirtless man with tattoos on his chest who had been shot twice in the back and once in each hand. Mendez dropped to his knees and listened.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s alive!\u201d Mendez shouted. \u201cBring a stretcher!\u201d\n\nAs he loaded the man into an ambulance, the victim\u2019s teenage daughter appeared, shoeless and in shock.\n\n\u201cStay cool,\u201d Mendez said as he guided her into the front seat and buckled her seat belt. \u201cStay calm.\u201d\n\nHer father was alert and moaning when staffers wheeled him into the hospital.\n\nA few hours later, he was dead.\n\nNew cartel brings new level of horror\n\nIn 2008, homicides in Tijuana hit a new high of 825.\n\nThe Sinaloa cartel, headed by Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, had tried to take over trafficking routes controlled by the Tijuana cartel and the results were deadly.\n\nBrutal fighting erupted between the cartels \u2014 and between the cartels and police and the hundreds of soldiers that then-President Felipe Calderon had sent to Tijuana as part of his new U.S.-backed war on drugs.\n\nThe city had never experienced anything like it. Assassins hung bodies from bridges and rolled dismembered heads down city streets. One day, seven police officers were ambushed and killed in the span of 45 minutes. Even wealthy areas were not safe from shootouts.\n\nWarfare was expensive, so gang leaders began kidnapping residents for ransom, spurring an exodus of the city\u2019s upper class. Tourism, on which the economy depended, dried up.\n\nBut by late 2010, the killings had begun to subside and peace seemed to have returned.\n\nCalderon said his government was winning the war on drugs \u2014 and that Tijuana was proof.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of civic and business leaders that year, he credited his government\u2019s \u201ckingpin strategy,\u201d which targeted cartel leaders.\n\nTijuana, he said, was \u201ca clear, concrete example \u2026 that the challenge of security has a solution.\u201d\n\nWhen he mentioned Gen. Alfonso Duarte Mugica, who had been leading the fight against the cartels in Tijuana, the crowd burst into applause.\n\nBy 2012, the number of homicides had fallen to 367, and Tijuana was blossoming into a tourist destination known for its craft breweries, art and music scene and haute cuisine.\n\nBut the peace did not last.\n\nWith the Sinaloa cartel beset by infighting after Guzman\u2019s arrest in 2014, other cartels saw opportunity.\n\nSoon the newly ascendant Jalisco New Generation Cartel muscled into Tijuana. It wanted access to the border, and also sought control of the city\u2019s local drug trade.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the annual body count jumped from 493 to 919. But that was only a prelude to a bigger explosion in violence.\n\nWhat the children see in Tijuana\n\nCaught in the middle of the chaos were men like Rafael Noriega Pe\u00f1a.\n\nNoriega came to Tijuana as a teenager from the coast of Sonora state, where the only decent work was overnight fishing on the Sea of Cortez.\n\nHis parents, who toiled in the maquiladoras, warned him and his siblings to stay away from the narcos.\n\n\u201cIf you go out with wolves, they will teach you to howl,\u201d his mother used to say.\n\nBy the time he was in his 30s, Noriega had five children with two women, a factory job he hated and a raging addiction to cristal.\n\nHis siblings pooled their meager factory wages so he could enter a rehabilitation facility in late 2017. Each weekend, they brought him homemade chile rellenos.\n\nNoriega left the program in March, but his sobriety didn\u2019t last.\n\nShortly before dawn one morning in May, his mother awoke to the sound of five gunshots. She stumbled, screaming, to his room off the back of the house. He was slumped in a chair, dead.\n\nImages from the front lines of Tijuana's deadly drug war \u00bb\n\nHis relatives don\u2019t know who killed him or why. The night of the shooting, they gathered in the kitchen while their children played outside with strips of crime scene tape.\n\nTomas, who was now his mother\u2019s only son, put his arms around her.\n\n\u201cYou have four other children to live for,\u201d he said as she sobbed.\n\nHis 6-year-old daughter, Michel, entered the house with a toy gun. She pointed it at him and pretended to shoot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a narco!\u201d she said, giggling.\n\nHe shook her by the shoulders. \u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d he asked angrily.\n\nHe released her. He knew the answer.\n\n\u201cAs a child ... what do you see here?\u201d he said, with tears in his eyes. \u201cPure violence.\u201d\n\nPolice raids seem futile\n\nThe police officers locked eyes, nodded, then stormed into the squalid apartment building on a hunt for drug dealers.\n\nThey moved down a corridor with flashlights, kicking open doors of cell-like rooms strewn with used needles, mattresses and cups of urine.\n\nThere were no dealers, just sprawled-out junkies who barely noticed the intrusion.\n\nThe police moved on to their next target, a dimly lighted watering hole called Norteno Bar tucked amid the strip clubs and taco shops of Tijuana\u2019s Zona Norte.\n\nPolice frisked more than a dozen patrons and found only a single dose of meth, in the pocket of a man in his 70s.\n\nRaids like these, conducted one night in December, are among the city\u2019s primary tactics to reduce violence. But many here believe they are futile, and that time and resources would be better spent on intelligence-driven policing to identify those likely to carry out violence.\n\nA specialized Tijuana city police unit performs stop-and-frisk raids for drugs and firearms at the Norteno Bar in Tijuana. Such raids are among Tijuana\u2019s primary tactics to reduce violence and drug deals. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times\n\nState investigators and prosecutors also have a role to play: More than 9 out of 10 of Tijuana\u2019s killings go unsolved.\n\nCritics say the homicide crisis has gotten short shrift because most of the victims are addicts and dealers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to watch them not manage the problem and just wait for them to kill themselves,\u201d said Jaime Arredondo, a researcher at the British Columbia Center on Substance Use who has spent years studying Tijuana\u2019s local drug trade.\n\nThe city\u2019s police chief, Marco Antonio Sotomayor, has said repeatedly that tourists and most residents shouldn\u2019t worry about the violence.\n\n\u201cThose who are dying are young people and criminals who get into a world where they know that part of the risk of that business is \u2026 that they will lose their lives,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to understand the city is not on fire,\u201d he said.\n\nAdela Navarro Bello, the director of Zeta magazine, which has long chronicled cartel activity in Tijuana, said such a view was shortsighted.\n\nThe 2008 spike in violence proved that battles between the cartels hurt society as a whole, she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t put an end to this fight, this is going to grow.\u201d\n\nA high-ranking state police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said cartel leaders might themselves be unable to control the violence, which is fueled by easy access to guns smuggled from the U.S. and assassins who will kill for as little as $50 or a few hits of meth.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t control it,\u201d the official said, \u201cthey can\u2019t control it.\u201d\n\nKidnapped, tortured, killed\n\nTwo years ago, Antolin Tinajero was kidnapped in a meth lab by members of an opposing gang, tortured and left dead on the side of a road.\n\nHis brother Lucio, who was also at the lab that day, escaped and went into hiding.\n\nLater that year, his brother Cipriano was shot and killed in an altercation outside his house.\n\nHis brother Mario was also shot \u2014 at the local tiendita \u2014 but survived.\n\nTheir sister Esperanza Navarro, the lone girl of 10 siblings, went to the hospital or the morgue each time because her mother, a migrant from Guadalajara who cleaned houses for a living, was illiterate and could not fill out the paperwork.\n\nEsperanza pleaded with her brothers to leave drugs behind: \u201cAll you do is cause pain,\u201d she told them.\n\nA cluster of mass graves where unidentified bodies \u2014 the majority of them homicide victims \u2014 are buried in Tijuana after they are transported from the city\u2019s Medical Forensic Service morgue.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLast year, her brother Francisco decided she was right and tried to get clean.\n\nAs a local dealer in a dangerous neighborhood called Camino Verde, he knew that if he crossed from the hill where he lived to another one about half a mile away, he could be killed. \u201cThe violence is with the low-level people,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the chiefs.\u201d\n\nOne day in August, he went to pick up his son, who was with his mother on the other hill.\n\nHe was ambushed by a gunman, who shot him in the face, the top of the head and the arm.\n\nHe survived, though his speech is now slurred. His sister thinks he is using drugs again.\n\nShe wishes she could leave Tijuana with her three children but is too poor: \u201cYou want to grab your family and go as far as you can.\u201d\n\nTrying to get clean \u2014 again\n\nDrug rehab is a growing industry in Tijuana, with 98 state-certified centers in the city compared with 60 in 2007.\n\nAt Una Nueva Vida \u2014 or A New Life \u2014 roughly 70% of 170 residents are being treated for meth addiction, said its director, Ernesto Chavez Gutierrez, a former lawyer who is also a recovering addict.\n\nOne of the youngest, a 14-year-old, was brought to the center several months ago by his weeping father. Local gang members had come to the house to try to kill the boy, who had begun hallucinating and stealing cars.\n\nThe father couldn\u2019t afford the $370 a month treatment fee, so Chavez gave him a break.\n\nA few months later, the father returned and checked himself into the program. He, too, was addicted to meth.\n\nChristian Castillo checked himself into Una Nueva Vida last summer, spending the first week locked in a room with a television to detox. He is now seven months clean and is doing so well that he has been given a leadership role. He carries a walkie-talkie and keeps the peace among residents, whose cravings can sometimes make them violent.\n\nCastillo plans to wait an additional five months before he leaves rehab.\n\nHe has gone through this twice before. The last time, he was on the streets for two hours before he started using again.\n\nChristian Castillo, right, with Kevin Orozco on Dec. 31 during Castillo\u2019s treatment for his addiction to crystal methamphetamine at Una Nueva Vida rehabilitation facility.

Soon came walkouts at two more Eastside high schools, Roosevelt and Lincoln, in protest of run-down campuses, lack of college prep courses, and teachers who were poorly trained, indifferent or racist.\n\nBy the time the \u201cblowouts\u201d peaked about a week later, 22,000 students had stormed out of class, delivered impassioned speeches and clashed with police. Scenes of rebellion filled newspapers and television screens. School trustees held emergency meetings to try to quell the crisis; Mayor Sam Yorty suggested students had fallen under the influence of \u201ccommunist agitators.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of the disruptions, Julian Nava, the only Mexican American on the Los Angeles Board of Education, turned to Superintendent of Schools Jack Crowther. \u201cJack,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is B.C. and AD. The schools will not be the same hereafter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Crowther. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nThe East L.A. walkouts 50 years ago were the uniquely California embodiment of the fury and hope that marked much of 1968. The first act of mass militancy by Mexican Americans in modern California history set the tone for activism across the Southwest as America drifted into a year of social turmoil, assassinations, war and disillusionment.\n\nRELATED | 1968: A timeline of anger, grief and change \u00bb\n\nThe walkouts focused national attention on a new force on the American political scene, the Chicano movement. Once a pejorative term, \u201cChicano\u201d was adopted by a new generation of urbanized Mexican Americans as an emblem of ethnic pride, cultural awareness and a commitment to community.\n\n\u201cWe caught the entire nation by surprise,\u201d said David Sanchez, founder of the militant Brown Berets, which had its seeds in the movement for educational reform and then took on farmworker rights, police brutality and the issue that managed to mobilize just about everyone who was protesting in 1968: the Vietnam War. \u201cBefore the walkouts, no one cared that substandard schools made it all but impossible for Chicano youths to find strength and pride in their culture, language and history \u2014 or to make the most of their lives,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\n\u201cAfter the walkouts,\u201d he added, \u201cno one could deny that we were ready to go to prison if necessary for what we believed, which was this: With better education, the Chicano community could control its own destiny.\u201d\n\nPete Martinez, a former teacher at Lincoln, said students that year ignited a movement that would transform generations of Latinos in America. \u201cIn 1968, the kids kicked the doors open,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Sanchez, founder of the Brown Berets, in 1968 and today.

(Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times; Raul Ruiz)\n\nWith better education, the Chicano community could control its own destiny.\u201d David Sanchez, Brown Berets founder\n\nIn 1968, Mexican American students living east of downtown were funneled into high schools with some of the worst dropout rates in the nation \u2014 57% at Garfield, 45% at Roosevelt, 39% at Lincoln.\n\nEastside schools were run-down and overcrowded, and the community had little political power. The Mexican American community was young \u2014 about half the population was under 20 \u2014 and there were no Mexican Americans on the City Council or Board of Supervisors.\n\nAt Eastside schools, Spanish speakers felt trapped in slower tracks that funneled them toward low-skilled jobs.\n\nHarry Gamboa, now a celebrated photographer and performance artist, remembered the day in elementary school when the teacher led him to the front of the class and helped him fashion a hat made of construction paper as an art project. \u201cShe put it on my head and wrote the word \u2018Spanish\u2019 on it. She said I could take it off when I learned to speak English,\u201d he said. Years later, he would join the walkouts at Garfield.\n\nAlthough the walkouts seemed spontaneous, they grew out of years of social activism. Since 1963, Camp Hess Kramer, a Jewish summer camp in Malibu, had hosted motivational programs for outstanding East L.A. students, who shared grievances about their underperforming high schools and neglected neighborhoods.\n\nRELATED | Do you remember the East L.A. walkouts? Share your memories \u00bb\n\nOthers stopped in at the Social Action Training Center, an effort run out the Church of the Epiphany in Lincoln Heights by John Luce, an Episcopal priest who supported labor leader Cesar Chavez.\n\nFour young activists opened the La Piranya Coffee Shop in 1967 at the corner of Olympic and Goodrich boulevards as headquarters for their organization, Chicano Youths for Community Action. They were led by Sanchez, then a clean-cut 18, who was president of Yorty\u2019s youth advisory commission, and Vickie Castro, a Cal State Los Angeles student who, years later, would become the second Latino ever elected to the Los Angeles Board of Education.\n\nWe were all products of Camp Kramer and Church of the Epiphany and, therefore, aspired to remake society.\u201d Vickie Castro (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cWe were all products of Camp Kramer and Church of the Epiphany and, therefore, aspired to remake society,\u201d Castro recalled. \u201cAt La Piranya, we organized strategies for doing just that, and shared outrage over things like a Time magazine article that described East L.A. as \u2018reeking of garbage and wine.\u2019\u201d\n\nLa Piranya\u2019s walls were covered with murals depicting scenes from Mexico\u2019s past, and a startling declaration in large black letters: \u201cPor mi raza mato,\u201d or \u201cFor my race I kill.\u201d\n\nRevolution was in the air. Black militant Stokely Carmichael swung by La Piranya. So did two figures known for their edgy and angry brand of activism \u2014 Rodolfo \u201cCorky\u201d Gonzales of Colorado and Reies Tijerina of New Mexico.\n\nOne day in 1967, hours before a protest against police harassment, Sanchez ran by the garment district to buy a dozen berets \u2014 the headgear seen on countless posters of Latin American revolutionary Che Guevara. Back at La Piranya, he dealt them out like playing cards, saying, \u201cPut these on, we\u2019re going to a demonstration.\u201d\n\nThe Chicano Youths for Community Action had became the Brown Berets.\n\nThe group operated under a manual written by Sanchez that included a passage members were required to memorize:\n\n\u201cFor over 20 years, the Mexican American has suffered at the hands of the Anglo establishment. He is discriminated against in schooling, housing, in employment and in every other phase of life. Because of this situation, the Mexican American has become the lowest achiever of any minority group in the entire Southwest.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Brown Berets listen to a speaker during the East L.A. walkouts on June 9, 1968.

Los Angeles Times\n\nWhat people were only beginning to realize was that \u2014 much as the students at a Florida high school this year have seized the debate over gun control from the adults \u2014 it was the high school students of East L.A. who would refuse to wait for the adults to act.\n\nSal Castro, then a social studies teacher at Lincoln and a charismatic guest speaker at La Piranya, said his students \u201cwanted things changed at the school. They wanted to hold what they called a \u2018blowout\u2019 \u2014 a walkout.\u201d\n\nHis response: \u201cOrganize. What do you need?\u201d\n\nThe original plan was to present a series of demands \u2014 and the threat of a walkout \u2014 to the school board in 1967. The plot fizzled.\n\nBut the next year, on Friday, March 1, the principal at Wilson High in El Sereno abruptly canceled the school play, \u201cBarefoot in the Park,\u201d a romantic comedy deemed risque. Hundreds of students walked off campus in anger.\n\nThe organizers of the failed walkout plot saw their chance. Sal Castro, Brown Berets, college students and others, including students recruited from high schools, holed up at La Piranya and other hangouts over the weekend to prepare.\n\nBy Tuesday, March 5, they were ready to launch. Joseph Rodriguez, then a sophomore at Garfield High, recalled sitting in basic biology class when \u201csomeone banged on our wooden door yelling, \u2018Walkout! Walkout!\u2019 We heard commotion outside. Many of us, including the teacher, ran to the window to see what was going on.\n\n\u201cMy teacher looked me in the eyes,\u201d Rodriguez recalled, \u201cand said, \u2018I can see you\u2019re really interested in this stuff. You\u2019re free to go.\u2019\u201d\n\nRodriguez saw students hemorrhaging through the gates and onto surrounding sidewalks and streets. Sheriff\u2019s deputies in riot gear arrived and over bullhorns ordered them back to class. Most refused.\n\nJoseph Rodriguez was a Garfield High sophomore during the 1968 walkouts. He watched as students filed out of class and amassed in nearby streets, where some were beaten by police. Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times\n\nA Coca-Cola delivery truck happened to drive up, and students began grabbing bottles and hurling them at deputies. Wading into the fray were the Brown Berets, who had planned to offer students protection. Sanchez later boasted that he outran two deputies \u201cchasing after me with batons waving.\u201d\n\nThe next day, it was Vickie Castro\u2019s mission to occupy the Lincoln principal while cohorts fanned out across campus and encouraged students to leave school. She pretended to be an applicant for a teacher\u2019s assistant position and peppered the principal with questions.\n\n\u201cI held the principal hostage for 20 minutes while one worried staffer after another rushed into his office to whisper the worsening news in his ear,\u201d she recalled with a chuckle. \u201cFinally, he said, \u2018Sorry, but I really have to go.\u2019 Then I drove to Roosevelt High for more action.\u201d\n\nWhen Vickie Castro pulled up at her alma mater, an administrator recognized her. \u201cVickie, if you come on campus I\u2019ll have you arrested,\u201d she said. \u201cTurn around. Now.\u201d\n\nShe drove off \u2014 for the other side of the campus, and joined other activists inciting students to walk. A brief clash with police resulted in several arrests. Students walked out at Belmont the next day. Protest plans there had spread not just by word of mouth, but by messages written in marker on the grout between tiles: \u201cWalkout. Today. 12:30.\u201d\n\nPolice handcuff two women, a Brown Beret and a Free Press photographer, in front of Belmont High School on March 8.

McCarthy / Herald-Examiner Collection / Los Angeles Public Library) Sheriff's deputies form a line near Garfield High on March 5, the first day of the student \"blowouts.\" (Joe Kennedy / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn years to come, the Eastside would be the site of protests decrying the Vietnam War and immigration policy. But these early walkouts were about education. Students carried American flags and signs reading, \u201cWe demand schools that teach,\u201d \u201cSchool not prison\u201d and \u201cWe are not \u2018dirty Mexicans.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring one day of protest, a heavy rain broke out. At Lincoln, a few of the demonstrators who braved the downpour noticed that the water streaming down Sal Castro\u2019s face was mixed with tears of pride.\n\nThe unrest continued for about a week, with protests erupting at a few other campuses \u2014 even two junior highs \u2014 not originally included in the walkout plans. At a raucous school board meeting 10 days into the protests, students presented 36 demands. Some seemed excessive: Only pass/fail grades. Student lounges with jukeboxes. Mexican dishes in the cafeteria prepared by local mothers.\n\nOthers were very basic: Smaller classes. New libraries. More bilingual counselors, teachers and principals. Improved testing to distinguish between a lack of English proficiency and lack of intelligence. More lessons on Mexican American culture, art and history. And no corporal punishment.\n\nWilson High School student Peter Rodriguez waves his intact draft card at a school board meeting on March 12 to rebut authorities' claims that the protests were inspired by communism. Raul Ruiz\n\nThe school board agreed outright to two of the demands \u2014 more bilingual personnel and smaller classes. Generally, however, the district said it was already doing what the students asked, or wanted to comply but lacked funds.\n\nIn the walkouts\u2019 aftermath, the organizers basked in support from high-profile leaders, including Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, who made time to congratulate some students on the tarmac at Santa Monica Airport while in California to meet Cesar Chavez.\n\nSome educators supported the students, but quietly. \u201cWe were secretly guided behind the scenes by sympathetic teachers and administrators who used us, in a way, as their own vehicles for change,\u201d Vickie Castro recalled. \u201cThey even helped me write speeches I gave after the blowouts during meetings with school officials.\u201d\n\nWe were secretly guided behind the scenes by sympathetic teachers and administrators who used us, in a way, as their own vehicles for change.\u201d Vickie Castro Sal Castro talks to students at Lincoln High in 1968. Los Angeles Times\n\nBut the walkouts also unleashed ugly emotions. As an example of the attitudes Mexican American students faced, community leaders cited an essay Richard C. Davis, a wood shop instructor at Lincoln, published that spring in the school\u2019s faculty publication.\n\nDeclaring that \u201cmost of the Mexican Americans have never had it so good,\u201d he wrote: \u201cBefore the Spanish came, he was an Indian grubbing in the soil and after the Spanish came, he was a slave. It seems to me that America must be a very desirable place, witness the number of \u2018wetbacks\u2019 and migrants both legal and illegal from Mexico\u2026.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cWhen it comes to going to school \u2014 free and the best in the world \u2014 he (the Mexican-American) is passive. Absenteeism is his culture, his way of life \u2014 always manana maybe he will get an education \u2014 manana, when it comes to repairing his home, controlling childbirth, planning for tomorrow, he is passive.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement responded with undercover operations, raids and arrests. In June, authorities rounded up 13 activists, who were indicted by a grand jury on charges including conspiracy in having planned the walkouts. Each faced 66 years in prison.\n\nAmong those indicted were Sanchez and Sal Castro, who was the only teacher to publicly participate and back students\u2019 complaints to news media and school district officials.\n\nHe lost his job but was eventually reinstated after months of protests by Eastside parents. Castro had employment, but was bounced around to different campuses and made a substitute before finally landing at Belmont as a teacher. The indictments against the \u201cEastside 13\u201d were struck down by an appeals court in 1970.\n\nA year after the walkouts, UCLA\u2019s enrollment of Mexican Americans soared from 100 to 1,900. Over the decades, college enrollment increased from 2% to 25% nationwide. Chicano studies programs were founded at colleges and universities across the nation. More Mexican Americans also entered the ranks of vice principals and principals in the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\nBut perhaps the walkouts\u2019 greatest accomplishment was fostering in the Mexican American community a sense of possibility \u2014 the realization that a just cause sometimes requires speaking up.\n\n\u201cUntil that day, it never crossed my mind that Garfield High was run-down, overcrowded and lagging behind public schools in wealthier white neighborhoods,\u201d said Rodriguez, who later became a prize-winning columnist at the San Jose Mercury News. \u201cAll that changed after the blowouts.\u201d\n\nUntil that day, it never crossed my mind that Garfield High was ... lagging behind public schools in wealthier white neighborhoods. All that changed after the blowouts.\u201d Joseph Rodriguez\n\nMexican American parents who had never attended a school board meeting watched their children addressing the board. Rodriguez recalled that his father was initially appalled by the protests, then decided the students were right.\n\nVickie Castro recounted a dinner table confrontation with her own father. \u201cMy dad stared down at me,\u201d she said, \u201cand announced, \u2018Mija, I never thought you\u2019d grow up to be a communist.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no communist, Dad!\u201d she responded. \u201cThere\u2019s something terribly wrong with our schools. Our future is at stake.\u201d\n\nShe went on to become a teacher, principal and a Los Angeles school board member. But her role in the walkouts caused a rift in her family. One cousin, a sheriff\u2019s deputy, refused to speak to her for years.\n\nAs a middle school principal in East L.A. many years later, her radical past collided head on with the establishment world of education when three students walked out of class because they couldn\u2019t access their grades during a teacher\u2019s work stoppage. She suspended them.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be the other side of a walkout situation,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut that situation wasn\u2019t at all the same.\u201d\n\nVickie Castro, one of the leaders of the 1968 walkouts, is now a middle school principal in East L.A. Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times\n\nLater, she was approached by a group of Eastside high school students, many of them flanked by their parents, who were fed up because the campus cafeteria was serving too many burritos, and not enough variety.\n\n\u201cI had to turn around and stifle a chuckle,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, I fought hard for those burritos!\u201d\n\nThis year LAUSD is remembering the walkouts with seminars, instructional materials and an arts festival. The Plaza de Cultura y Artes in downtown will host a major exhibition on the walkouts\u2019 legacy. Many screenings are planned of \u201cWalkout,\u201d a movie about those fiery days produced by Moctesuma Esparza, who was one of the Eastside 13.\n\nThe dropout rates at Eastside high schools have improved dramatically since 1968 \u2014 Garfield, 13%; Roosevelt, 28%; and Lincoln, 21%. But they remain far higher than those at affluent Westside campuses, such as Malibu High, where it hovers at about 5%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way,\u201d Vickie Castro said, \u201cbut there\u2019s still a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nSome of that work is being carried out at a campus just west of downtown. It used to be Belmont Middle School. In 2010 it got a new name: Salvador B. Castro Middle School.\n\nSi desea leer esta nota en espa\u00f1ol, haga clic aqui\n\nSupport our journalism Already a subscriber? Thank you for your support.

Following their flight plan, the astronauts were executing a 180-degree roll, slowly turning the capsule as it shot through space.\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d\n\nAstronaut Bill Anders had been peering out a side window, holding up a bulky Hasselblad camera to take photographs of the moon\u2019s cratered surface. Looking up at the lunar horizon, he glimpsed something that no one had seen before: an Earthrise.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the Earth comin\u2019 up,\u201d he said, a trace of wonder in his voice. \u201cWow, is it pretty!\u201d\n\nDown there, on that gorgeous blue orb, it had been a hell of a year. The Vietnam War was raging, and Americans were fighting one another in the streets of their own cities.

The Cultural Revolution swept like a fury across China; the Soviet Union crushed the Prague Spring. Assassins claimed the lives of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F.

It invited people to step away from one of the most contentious years anyone could remember and gain some perspective.

In 1968, the United States was a deeply divided nation, whose president was viewed by many as crass and unbefitting his office. The United States was mired in a long war that many saw as pointless. White supremacists, rallying behind the presidential campaign of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, appeared newly emboldened. Gun violence and rampant drug abuse had given rise to worries about the fundamental health of American society. Women, people of color and gays and lesbians were demanding equality and respect.\n\nAnd each day seemed to bring a new shock.\n\nA soldier is wounded during the Tet Offensive in January 1968.

Later that month, North Vietnam launched the Tet Offensive, a massive assault on U.S.-held bases and cities throughout South Vietnam that deeply shook the confidence of the American public over a war their leaders had told them they were winning.\n\nIn February, Associated Press photographer Eddie Adams took a picture of South Vietnamese Gen.

Eugene McCarthy came within 230 votes of defeating Johnson in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. Four days later, Sen. Robert Kennedy, younger brother of the slain president, announced that he too would challenge the incumbent.

As autumn arrives in the northwest corner of Alaska\u2019s Arctic, the land is folding in on itself in a riot of activity, color, cold air and sunshine \u2014 the natural world\u2019s last shout before the arrival of dark and ice.\n\n\u201cI like the fall up here,\u201d said Jay Denton, an educator raised in North Carolina who\u2019s spent the last decade in the small towns and villages of the region. Now he lives in Kotzebue, the town of some 3,200 residents about 20 river miles from Hugo\u2019s bald dome.\n\nDenton stared down at the broad cursive of the Noatak River as it trickled from the western edge of the Brooks Range toward the Chukchi Sea, flanked by taxi-yellow willows and spiky green spruce and miles of rolling tundra.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nFall in the Arctic is something to behold. It begins with a rush of chilled air that prompts the vegetation to change, a shift in the light, and a flurry of movement, both human and animal. It is a season of paradoxes as the flora and fauna come alive on the cusp of winter. But there\u2019s also the inevitable feeling of decay, of an ephemeral landscape slipping away.\n\nThis part of the country rarely makes headlines, even in Alaska. It was front and center for a day or two in 2015 during a visit from Barack Obama, the first-ever trip by a sitting U.S. president to the American Arctic. A celebration was held in the school gym. More recently, the tragic case of a missing 10-year-old girl found dead after a frantic weeklong search elicited gestures of support from around the state, with residents donning purple, Ashley Johnson-Barr\u2019s favorite color.\n\nDenton gestured toward the yellow and green vegetation, which won\u2019t stay that way long. \u201cThat\u2019ll go straight to brown right there,\u201d he said. There might be a brief interlude of red on the way.\n\nAnd that autumnal sense of decline is accompanied by a sensation of gratitude and optimism prompted by morning frost and the return of a dark night sky after months of inescapable sunlight.\n\nRising prominently along this stretch of the river is Hugo Mountain, a semi-popular hiking destination for Kotzebue residents and their guests, graffitied with the names of visitors written in fist- and head-sized stones gathered from the scree: Ted, Dana, Haiden, Carl, Amanda.\n\nThe journey upriver to Hugo in early September is a minor Arctic safari.

Zachariah Hughes / For The Times\n\nHidden in the vegetation and distance is the source of coveted red meat \u2014 caribou and moose.\n\n\u201cThis time of year it\u2019s really satisfying to gather your own sustenance,\u201d said 34-year-old Hans Hansen. Born and raised in Kotzebue, Hansen practices a hybrid lifestyle melding traditional subsistence hunting with the demands of a professional life in town as a physical therapist, husband and father. It means his fall weekends are spent looking for nourishing flesh to put away for the winter.\n\n\u201cIf I could, I\u2019d take the whole month of September off,\u201d Hansen said. He grew up hunting, taking his first caribou at 12, his first moose in 9th grade. The season is optimal for meat harvesting. The summer-plumped moose are moving. The caribou herds begin migrating south. Hansen loves the fall, not purely for the pragmatism of the season, but the sensation it enlivens.\n\n\u201cThe hunting gets you to establish a stronger connection being out in the nature,\u201d he said.\n\nSummer in the Arctic is intense. The sun never sets, hovering omnipresent with a glaring light that rarely relents. Bugs swarm incessantly. As the melting winter snow turns into mud, a kind of stasis sets in.\n\n\u201cSummer up here is boring,\u201d as Hansen put it.\n\nBut in August the land starts cooling off. The angle of the sun begins to sharpen. Colors saturate the long sunsets. The promise of restful dark nights and the mystery of stars return. Wild berries spring forth on the tundra like tiny jewels.\n\n\u201cBerry picking is part of life,\u201d said Faith Jurs, principal of the school in Noorvik, a small community of fewer than 700 people 43 miles upriver from Kotzebue.\n\n\"Berry picking is part of life\" in Arctic Alaska, a resident says. Zachariah Hughes / For The Times\n\nThe infinite tapestry of the tundra assumes more detail as clusters of ruby-red cranberries plump up. Low-bush blueberries dangle from scrubby vegetation like soft-skinned sapphires.\n\n\u201cBerry picking\u201d means something different here than in the Lower 48, where you might pay by the pound to roam the orderly rows of a tame orchard. Here it\u2019s free and wild. Folks spend hours scouring the ground, often conscripting their kids to help fill buckets with gallons of berries.\n\nMuch of it will be frozen for winter. In a part of the world where store-bought food is expensive and people still wrest enormous shares of protein from the land, sea and air, berries are one of the few locally available fruit options, a rare burst of sweet flavor in the dark tedium of deep February.\n\nAccording to Jurs, if you miss the weeks-long window to spend hours berry plucking, in Noorvik, folks will call out over the town\u2019s VHF radio \u2014 a sort of community-wide intercom still popular in rural bush communities \u2014 with offers to sell a gallon for $45. \u201cI think that\u2019s a bargain.\u201d\n\nEven though it was 9 p.m., Jurs was sitting in a lawn chair wearing sunglasses, enjoying the steep orange rays of sunlight, even as the chill air necessitated a jacket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect amount of light,\u201d she said of the season.\n\nJurs was in Kotzebue visiting her honey, Joe Groves, who in between sips of his drink would tend to cooking on the porch. Through the evening small plates suddenly materialized with samples of piping hot meatloaf, or freshly caught trout cooked so tender it dissolved at first taste like a meringue.\n\n\u201cSoon those greens won\u2019t be there, the caribou won\u2019t be there, and the moose won\u2019t be fat,\u201d Groves said of the fleeting fall.\n\nA view of Kotz Harbor in Kotzebue, a town of around 3,200. Zachariah Hughes / For The Times\n\nHistorically, fall was a difficult time, Groves said, because it used to be brief and intense. Climate change is altering that rhythm. The Arctic is warming much faster than southern environments, and fall is a prime example: The season is elongating.\n\n\u201cIt starts earlier and lasts longer,\u201d Jurs said. When she first came to the region 22 years ago, it snowed without fail before her birthday on Sept. 13. \u201cNow it may or may not.\u201d\n\nYears ago, there was no chance of launching a boat in the river during October because the ice would have started forming. \u201cNow you\u2019re almost guaranteed two weeks in October,\u201d Groves said.\n\nThe flip side is a later freeze-up along the rivers and tundra, delaying travel by \u201csnow machine,\u201d as Alaskans call snowmobiles, later and later. The variability is an undeniable threat for the region: unpredictable ice conditions, coastal erosion, changing animal patterns, infrastructure havoc \u2014 and unforeseen variables yet to pour out of a Pandora\u2019s climatological box.\n\nBut for inhabitants it is not a uniform blight.\n\n\u201cThis season is wonderful,\u201d Jurs said. \u201cIt used to be like two weeks long, and now it might be six weeks long. Which is bad for the world and great for us.\u201d\n\nEven for fans, the pleasure is unsettling.\n\n\u201cI know global warming is terrible,\u201d Jurs said, \u201cbut it\u2019s kind of nice.\u201d\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

Then there were those murky tales of a sprawling city on the Great Plains and a chief who drank from a goblet of gold.\n\nA few years ago, Donald Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeology professor at Wichita State University , began piecing things together. And what he\u2019s found has spurred a rethinking of traditional views on the early settlement of the Midwest, while potentially filling a major gap in American history.\n\nUsing freshly translated documents written by the Spanish conquistadors more than 400 years ago and an array of high-tech equipment, Blakeslee located what he believes to be the lost city of Etzanoa, home to perhaps 20,000 people between 1450 and 1700.\n\nThey lived in thatched, beehive-shaped houses that ran for at least five miles along the bluffs and banks of the Walnut and Arkansas rivers. Blakeslee says the site is the second-largest ancient settlement in the country after Cahokia in Illinois.\n\nOn a recent morning, Blakeslee supervised a group of Wichita State students excavating a series of rectangular pits in a local field.\n\nJeremiah Perkins, 21, brushed dirt from a half-buried black pot.\n\nOthers sifted soil over screened boxes, revealing arrowheads, pottery and stone scrapers used to thin buffalo hides.\n\nBlakeslee, 75, became intrigued by Etzanoa after scholars at UC Berkeley retranslated in 2013 the often muddled Spanish accounts of their forays into what is now Kansas. The new versions were more cogent, precise and vivid.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, their eyewitness descriptions are so clear it\u2019s like you were there.\u2019 I wanted to see if the archaeology fit their descriptions,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single detail matched this place.\u201d\n\nKacie Larsen of Wichita State University shakes dirt through a screened box to see what artifacts may emerge. David Kelly / For The Times\n\nConquistadors are often associated with Mexico, but a thirst for gold drove them into the Midwest as well.\n\nFrancisco Vazquez de Coronado came to central Kansas in 1541 chasing stories of a fabulously wealthy nobleman who napped beneath trees festooned with tinkling gold bells. He found no gold, but he did find Native Americans in a collection of settlements he dubbed Quivira.\n\nIn 1601, Juan de O\u00f1ate led about 70 conquistadors from the Spanish colony of New Mexico into south-central Kansas in search of Quivira in the hopes of finding gold, winning converts for the Catholic Church and extracting tribute for the crown.\n\nAccording to Spanish records, they ran into a tribe called the Escanxaques, who told of a large city nearby where a Spaniard was allegedly imprisoned. The locals called it Etzanoa.\n\nAs the Spaniards drew near, they spied numerous grass houses along the bluffs. A delegation of Etzanoans bearing round corn cakes met them on the river bank. They were described as a sturdy people with gentle dispositions and stripes tattooed from their eyes to their ears. It was a friendly encounter until the conquistadors decided to take hostages. That prompted the entire city to flee.\n\nO\u00f1ate\u2019s men wandered the empty settlement for two or three days, counting 2,000 houses that held eight to 10 people each. Gardens of pumpkins, corn and sunflowers lay between the homes.\n\nThe Spaniards could see more houses in the distance, but they feared an Etzanoan attack and turned back.\n\nThat\u2019s when they were ambushed by 1,500 Escanxaques. The conquistadors battled them with guns and cannons before finally withdrawing back to New Mexico, never to return.\n\nThis bluff overlooks the spot where many believe Spanish conquistador Juan de O\u00f1ate met a delegation of Etzanoans. David Kelly / For The Times\n\nFrench explorers arrived a century later but found nothing. Disease likely wiped out Etzanoa, leaving it to recede into legend.\n\nBlakeslee enlisted the help of the National Park Service, which used a magnetometer to detect variations in the earth\u2019s magnetic field and find features around town that looked like homes, storage pits and places where fires were started.\n\nThen, relying on descriptions from the conquistadors, he discovered what he believes was the battle site in an upscale neighborhood of Arkansas City.\n\nVolunteers using metal detectors found three half-inch iron balls under the field. Blakeslee said they were 17th century Spanish cartridge shot fired from a cannon. A Spanish horseshoe nail was also found.\n\nIt all lent credibility to the detailed accounts left by the conquistadors.\n\nThe battlefield sits in Warren \u201cHap\u201d McLeod\u2019s backyard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great story,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lost city right under our noses.\u201d\n\nMcLeod, 71, offered a quick tour of the area.\n\nHe started at Camp Quaker Haven overlooking the spot where O\u00f1ate would have encountered the Etzanoans. McLeod then drove up to the country club, the highest point in the city of roughly 12,500 people.\n\n\u201cLots of artifacts have been taken from here,\u201d McLeod said.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nIn 1994, thousands of relics were unearthed during road construction. In 1959, the renowned archaeologist Waldo Wedel wrote in his classic book, \u201cAn Introduction to Kansas Archeology,\u201d that the valley floor and bluffs here \u201cwere littered with sherds, flints, and other detritus\u201d that went on for miles.\n\n\u201cNow we know why,\u201d McLeod said. \u201cThere were 20,000 people living here for over 200 years.\u201d\n\nLocal rancher Jason Smith, 47, said he had seen collections \u201cthat would blow your mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruckloads of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWorked stone tools, flints. One guy had 100 boxes at his house.\u201d\n\nRussell Bishop, 66, worked at the country club as a kid.\n\n\u201cMy boss had an entire basement full of pottery and all kinds of artifacts,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe\u2019d be out there working and he would recognize a black spot on the ground as an ancient campfire site.\u201d\n\nBishop, who now lives outside Denver, has coffee cans full of arrowheads. He spread some on his counter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knew how big this all was,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re finally getting to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nKansas State Archaeologist Robert Hoard said that based on the Spanish accounts and the evidence of a large settlement, it\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d that Blakeslee has found Etzanoa.\n\nStill, he would like more evidence.\n\nThe early Great Plains had long been imagined as a vast empty space populated by nomadic tribes following buffalo herds. But if Blakeslee is right, at least some of the tribes were urban. They built large towns, raised crops, made fine pottery, processed bison on a massive scale and led a settled existence. There were trade connections all the way to the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan in Mexico.\n\n\"So this was not some remote place. The people traded and lived in huge communities,\" Blakeslee said. \"Everything we thought we knew turns out to be wrong. I think this needs a place in every schoolbook.\"\n\nAnd that may just be the beginning. Blakeslee has found archaeological evidence in Rice and McPherson counties for other large settlements extending for miles, which he believes existed around the same time as Etzanoa.\n\nHe has published his findings in the peer-reviewed journal Plains Anthropologist, and next spring he will present his evidence for Etzanoa at the annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. A bigger excavation is planned for next summer.\n\nThe Wichita Nation, based three hours south in Anadarko, Okla., is watching all of this carefully. Experts believe the Etzanoans were their ancestors.\n\n\u201cThe accounts of O\u00f1ate and Coronado have been interpreted for years,\u201d said Gary McAdams, cultural program planner and historic preservation officer for the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, which number about 3,300. \u201cWe had a suspicion it was settled like this, but now it\u2019s starting to be documented, which makes it feel more real.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Arkansas City is trying to determine how to promote its new claim to fame. Etzanoa remains mostly underground or on private land. Yet that hasn\u2019t deterred interest.\n\n\u201cWe get about 10 calls a day to see the lost city,\u201d said Pamela Crain, director of the Convention & Visitors Bureau. \u201cThe vision is to have a visitors center. The other key is to persuade landowners to allow people onto their property.\u201d\n\nProfessor Donald Blakeslee of Wichita State University shows a black pot unearthed by student Jeremiah Perkins, behind him.

Town leaders are hoping for a UNESCO World Heritage site designation.\n\nBack at the dig site, all eyes were on Jeremiah Perkins as he lifted the hefty black potsherd from the dirt.\n\nBlakeslee dropped into the pit for a closer look. It was the largest artifact of the summer, perhaps 12 inches high.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice big cooking pot,\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nYet many mysteries remain about the people of Etzanoa.\n\n\u201cHow were they organized? How did they farm the bluffs? How did they maximize bison herds?\u201d Blakeslee asked. \u201cThe questions go on and on and on.\u201d\n\nAnd the thought of that made him smile.\n\nKelly is a special correspondent.\n\nALSO\n\nBeads, booze and babies?

Where was she? Why had she abandoned them? When would she come home to Arkansas?\n\nShe couldn\u2019t bear to tell them the truth \u2014 that she was in a remote village in El Salvador overrun with gangs \u2014 so she lied. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d\n\nThe United States deports hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year. But for Machado and other parents of American-born children, staying in their home country sometimes simply isn\u2019t an option, despite the risk.\n\nTo keep her promise to her kids, Machado had to embark on a dangerous journey abetted by abusive smugglers linked to a powerful drug cartel.\n\nShe would eventually make her way back to the sleepy town of Siloam Springs, Ark., but a reckless decision from her youth \u2014 and a little-known feature of American immigration policy \u2014 would threaten to separate her family yet again.\n\nMachado was 5 when she and her mother crossed illegally to the United States, fleeing bombings in their village during the final years of El Salvador\u2019s civil war.\n\nShe grew up speaking English with a laid-back California accent during her youth in Santa Ana. Later, after she and her mother moved to be near family in Arkansas, she adopted a gentle Southern drawl. She loved shopping and football and moved through life with a cheerful American optimism.\n\nAt age 19, Machado made a foolish mistake. After she fell behind on loan payments, her car was impounded. To get it out, she forged a friend's signature on two checks totaling $1,500.\n\nShe was found guilty of three felonies and, after completing a court-ordered boot camp program, vowed to never mess up like that again.\n\nA decade later, Machado said, she had turned her life around. She worked at an ophthalmologist\u2019s office, drove a BMW and had three photogenic kids. The father of her children was out of the picture, but Machado had met a kind man with a good job and they were engaged.\n\nShortly before Christmas in 2015, a routine traffic stop changed everything. Because she had an unpaid ticket, Machado was taken to a police station. There, an officer deputized to act as an immigration agent discovered Machado\u2019s felony convictions and began the process that led to her deportation.\n\nUnlike previous administrations, which had often targeted immigrants for deportation using arbitrary traffic checkpoints or workplace raids, President Obama had vowed to prioritize removals only of people with criminal convictions, saying he would target \u201cfelons not families.\u201d Machado thought she had paid her debt to society but discovered that as an immigrant in the country illegally, she didn\u2019t have the luxury of making mistakes.\n\nAfter fighting her case for 13 months, Machado was deported in January 2017. She arrived in El Salvador in shackles on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement plane.\n\nDistant relatives had offered her a place to stay in the rural hamlet of Hacienda La Carrera, but her broken Spanish and American clothing made her a target. Many homes had been abandoned by residents fleeing gangs that levied \u201ctaxes\u201d on locals and forced pretty women to be their girlfriends. In an interview in the village last year, Machado said machete-toting gang members had begun loitering outside.\n\nStill, what kept her up at night, as she listened for occasional bursts of gunfire and swatted away the mosquitoes that bit her arms and legs raw, was fear for her children: Dominic, 12; Dyanara, 11; and Dorian, 8. They were living in Siloam Springs with their grandmother, who rose before dawn to work at a meat-packing plant.\n\nMayra Machado shortly after she was deported to El Salvador in 2017. She didn't have a Salvadoran passport and didn't even know her native country's telephone code. Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times\n\nDominic still didn\u2019t know where she was but blamed himself for his mother\u2019s disappearance. At the time of the 2016 traffic stop, Machado had been returning to the store where he had left his eyeglasses.\n\nThe bright, outgoing boy, who shared his mother\u2019s wide smile and almond-shaped eyes, had become withdrawn during the months Machado spent in immigrant detention. He had started lashing out at his younger sister. His grades were slipping.\n\nMachado knew the dangers of trying to return to the United States. But, she told herself, she was a mother, and mothers are supposed to be with their kids.\n\nSo one morning in March 2017, less than three months after she was deported, Machado woke at dawn and trudged through miles of sugar cane fields toward a narrow highway, where she caught the first of many buses north.\n\nShe was finally nearing the U.S. border when a smuggler put a gun to her head.\n\nMachado had been on the migrant trail for weeks, hiding from authorities in taxi trunks and crowded tractor-trailers. She had gone days at a time without eating and had begun dreaming about what it would feel like to take a shower.\n\nBut only now, as the smuggler cocked his gun, did she realize the danger she was in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the hands of the Gulf cartel ,\u201d she thought. And then: \u201cI might die, and my children will never see their mother again.\u201d\n\nMachado had used $8,000 of her savings to pay a smuggling network that had promised a short journey to the United States. But arriving that April in Tamaulipas, the northern Mexican state where drug gangs had entered the human trafficking business, it didn\u2019t matter that Machado had paid all that cash weeks before. The smugglers said she would have to wait to cross the border until they were ready.\n\nAt a dingy safe house filled with dirty mattresses, Machado was made to cook and clean. She knew nothing about Mexican cuisine, and when she messed up while making salsa, the men threw it in her face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fat and lazy!\u201d screamed one cartel member as he beat her. Twice, Machado said, she fought off his attempts at rape.\n\nAfter months in captivity, the smugglers helped Machado cross the border. It was the Fourth of July, 2017.\n\nTwo family members picked her up in Texas and drove all night to Arkansas. Shortly before sunrise, she opened the door to the bedroom where her children were sleeping and woke them up with hugs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dreaming,\u201d they murmured.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really here.\u201d\n\nBack in Arkansas, Machado knew she had to earn back the trust of her children. Dominic had made that clear.\n\n\u201cWhy did you have to go away?\u201d he would ask on the days that he spoke to her at all.\n\nFor so long, she had lied. Finally, she decided to tell him the truth.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t born here, and I don\u2019t have citizenship,\u201d she said. Then she told him about the forged checks: \u201cIt was the worst mistake of my life.\u201d\n\nMachado opened a map, pointed to El Salvador and showed Dominic the more than 2,000 miles she had traveled. Dominic asked if she was going to disappear again. She shook her head.\n\nIn March of this year, she and the kids moved in with her fiance, Tony, whom her youngest son had started calling Dad. But she still lived a life in the shadows. Machado didn\u2019t have an ID. Didn\u2019t have a job. On the rare occasions she drove, she scanned the rearview mirror for police.\n\nOn a hot afternoon in May, she took the risk of picking up her daughter, who had just completed fifth grade. At a roundabout, the car in front of her stopped suddenly. Machado didn\u2019t.\n\nThe woman\u2019s Mercedes was not badly damaged, and Machado offered to pay on the spot for repairs. But the driver was angry and called the police.\n\nMachado panicked. She phoned her best friend, who urged her to flee. That would be wrong, Machado said.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d her friend urged. \u201cWhen the police come, give them my name instead of yours.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Machado did, but the officer grew suspicious. Why didn\u2019t Machado\u2019s photo flash on his screen when he typed her name into his system?\n\nWhen he threatened to call a fingerprint expert, Machado started crying. \u201cMy name is Mayra,\u201d she said.\n\nThe officer charged her with a felony for obstruction of government operations. The charge was eventually dropped, but by then Machado had been flagged by ICE, and she was once again taken into immigration custody.\n\nOnly this time, she would be charged with a more serious crime.\n\nDyanara Solis, 11, from left, and her brothers Dominic, 12, and Dorian 8, in Siloam Springs, Ark. The children are living with relatives after their mother, Mayra Machado, was deported to El Salvador last year. Michael Woods / For The Times\n\nThe Washington County Detention Center in Fayetteville, Ark., is a cluster of low-slung buildings in a suburban office park. Machado has been living there for months alongside women charged with federal crimes that include drug trafficking and murder.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the U.S. government stepped up the criminal prosecution of immigrants, reversing its longtime practice of treating immigration offenses as civil matters. Machado is one of thousands of immigrants who have been charged this year with the felony crime of reentering the U.S. after a previous deportation.\n\nHer court-appointed attorney has asked Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican whose reelection campaign has been endorsed by President Trump, to pardon Machado for the check forgery, in hopes of eliminating the rationale for deporting her. A grass-roots campaign has also taken up Machado\u2019s cause, recently holding a rally outside the Arkansas prison where activists chanted \u201cFree Mama Mayra!\u201d\n\nIf those efforts fail, Machado faces up to two years in prison \u2014 followed by a second deportation.\n\nThe idea of remaining behind pains her, but it is less scary than the idea of being immediately deported again. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll be safe in prison,\u201d she said.\n\nMachado has been prescribed medication for anxiety and depression, but in phone interviews from prison, she said she still cries all day. Her only respite, she said, is a twice-weekly Bible study class \u2014 and books.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to be a mother from afar, speaking on the phone at a cost of 50 cents a minute.\n\n\u201cWho will do my hair when you\u2019re not here?\u201d her little girl asks. \u201cI want to cuddle with you,\u201d her youngest son says.\n\nDominic doesn\u2019t speak much. He spends much of his time on his PlayStation. But recently, on a phone call, he told his mother, \u201cIf you go away again, it will break my heart.\u201d\n\nIf she is eventually deported, she would not bring the kids to El Salvador, not with the gangs.\n\n\u201cWhat if they looked at my daughter the way they looked at me?\u201d she wonders. \u201cWould my son become one of them?\u201d\n\nMachado wonders, too, if she will be able to stay in El Salvador, or if she will try to reach the U.S. once again.\n\nkate.linthicum@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @katelinthicum"}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-white-nationalist-terrorism-arrest-20190220-story.html", "text": "Christopher Paul Hasson called for \"focused violence\" to \"establish a white homeland\" and dreamed of ways to \"kill almost every last person on earth,\" according to court records filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland.

But that isn\u2019t to say a bogus emergency declaration cannot itself spark another crisis, and that\u2019s exactly what President Trump has done.\n\nThe president says the United State is in an official state of emergency because of border crossings from Mexico and will try to redirect money already allocated by Congress so he can build his wall. Any normal public servant can recognize how fundamentally undemocratic this is, which is why the president can only declare national emergencies, and therefore assume extraordinary power, when the machinery of representative government is truly ill-equipped to respond to a crisis.\n\nBut Trump did not declare a national emergency because of a crisis; he did it to overcome a political defeat, a move that the L.A. Times editorial board says is a gross abuse of power :\n\nOver weeks of negotiations stretching back into 2018, the Trump administration and its Republican allies in Congress grappled with congressional Democrats over how to address the growth in asylum arrivals and other border concerns. The spending bill that Trump is due to sign into law raises spending on border security to $22.54 billion \u2014 more than the budgets for disaster relief, the federal courts or the Environmental Protection Agency, to cite just a few examples.\n\nThe measure is a compromise that reflects bipartisan support for improved border security, as well as the two parties\u2019 different priorities. In addition to providing money for fencing, it increases the number of detention beds for deportable immigrants, expands immigration courts, adds hundreds of Border Patrol agents, supplies more money for drones and other border-surveillance technology, ramps up drug interdiction efforts at ports of entry, overhauls how Immigration and Customs Enforcement manages the cases under its purview, and addresses a number of complaints from Democrats about the treatment of detainees.\n\nUnder the Constitution, it\u2019s up to Congress to decide how federal dollars are spent. It\u2019s telling that Trump couldn\u2019t persuade lawmakers to give him more money for his wall, even by shutting much of the federal government down for a record 35 days. He simply doesn\u2019t have the votes for the project, which isn\u2019t surprising, given that polls show most Americans don\u2019t support it.\n\nInstead of taking his lumps and trying to make a better case for funding the wall next year, however, Trump is trying to circumvent Congress through a spurious emergency declaration. His supporters note how previous presidents have used executive orders to take steps Congress did not take; for example, President Truman ordered the armed forces to desegregate in 1948 after Congress failed to do so, and President Obama created a program allowing \u201cDreamers\u201d to seek temporary legal status after a comprehensive immigration reform bill stalled (a move that Trump has derided as unlawful). But there\u2019s a world of difference between using executive orders to accomplish things Congress could not, and declaring an emergency to overturn a decision Congress made. Administration officials have noted that Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush both used emergency declarations to shift military construction funds, but that was in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 not caravans of migrants.\n\n>> Click here to read more"}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-cocaine-seizure-port-hueneme-20190215-story.html", "text": "\u201cThis is the largest drug seizure at Port Hueneme in the last quarter of a century,\u201d said LaFonda Sutton-Burke, CBP port director of the Los Angeles/Long Beach Seaport and Port Hueneme. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of the results of this joint effort; it shows the professionalism, vigilance and keen focus of both agencies in preventing dangerous drugs into our communities.\u201d"}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-ln-20190215-anti-gang-funds-immigration-20190215-story.html", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s particularly timely today because the administration again and again flouts the most basic constitutional principles,\u201d said Los Angeles City Atty.

Home cooks are turning to online sources to find recipes and cooking tips, and they start researching Thanksgiving meals as early as two months in advance to create the perfect spread. Brands that want a starring role in this year\u2019s holiday celebrations should be present online when and where consumers search for cooking inspiration.\n\nDuring Thanksgiving week, recipe searches are twice as high as the average week. Most marketers focus campaigns on the weeks leading up to the holiday, but online searches for cooking-related content reach a peak on Thanksgiving Day. Brand marketers that want to surpass the competition should take advantage of this predictable traffic spike to influence consumers in the moment. After all, connected cooks love to have mobile devices on hand to look up their bookmarked recipes and tips while preparing holiday dishes.\n\nIn 2013, about 44 percent of Thanksgiving recipe searches happened on mobile devices, and this traffic increased by more than 20 percent the following year. So what type of recipes are most popular among connected cooks? People tend to stick to what they know when it comes to turkey, making them more likely to search for tasty side dishes and desserts. On an annual basis, dessert-related searches have increased three times faster than that of turkey recipes. However, searches about Thanksgiving leftovers are popular immediately after the holiday, and turkey plays a prominent role at this stage.\n\nWhen planning online campaigns, brand marketers should produce cook-friendly videos and make sure all content is easily searchable. Because cooks are increasingly using mobile devices in a food-filled environment, they frequently perform simple voice searches for hands-free navigation. Millennial cooks especially prefer videos over written content, so they can see and hear instructions while busy in the kitchen. Subscriptions to online food channels have soared in recent years, making video-hosting sites or branded video portals the best places to engage with consumers on Thanksgiving.\n\nWith Thanksgiving being a time of family and tradition, marketers should aim to tie in brands with emotional and celebratory experiences. Although many cooks are looking for creative twists on classic side dishes, their Thanksgiving menus are heavily influenced by their families, childhoods and hometowns. Consider the example of spice brand McCormick, which successfully used a lookbook content series that provided compelling background material for each recipe with personal stories and memories.\n\nGeographic location is another key factor, especially when it comes to food preparation. Classic roasting is the most popular turkey preparation method in the Northeast, while Southerners tend to pull out the deep fryer. Smoking is common in Midwest states, and brining is gaining ground in the Northwest. Brands that take note of these regional variations have the best chance of creating content that feels personal and relevant to home cooks.\n\nFor successful Thanksgiving promotions, smart brands should reflect upon the type of foods consumers are most likely to prepare and interesting ways they can incorporate new ingredients and flavors, such as seasoning blends and brines. Also, think beyond food prep, and produce content relating to other aspects of the meal, such as elegant plating and the best cooking techniques.\n\nMarketers should plan content for every stage of the search cycle, making sure to ramp up advertising on Thanksgiving Day when more cooks are connected online and fewer competitors are active. Before planning your Thanksgiving campaigns, contact the LA Times for tips on reaching consumers through digital and print strategies."}, {"source": "latimes", "url": "https://mediakit.latimes.com/the-new-era-of-video-marketing/", "text": "The equalizing effect of digital media has maximized brand competition, making it possible for businesses of all sizes to gain visibility with global consumers. For both B2C and B2B audiences, video marketing is key for connecting with customers and encouraging them to learn more about a brand. Not only is video easy to share with consumers around the world, but it also allows marketers to convey brand stories in short, engaging morsels that keep customers thinking about and interacting with a brand as they move toward a purchase. Find out what key trends in video marketing will distinguish successful brands in the new year.\n\nDiversified Content and Sales Efficiency\n\nIn the past, many marketers dismissed the value of video content if a brand or product didn\u2019t have obvious virality or meme potential written all over it. In reality, video is just another way to tell a story, and that information doesn\u2019t have to be presented as a traditional ad or pop-culture content. Cisco estimates that video content will make up 69 percent of Internet traffic by 2018. Transactions are increasingly happening online, making it essential for brands to provide mobile-optimized videos that answer consumer questions quickly and succinctly.\n\nFrom testimonials and tutorials to webinars and product demos, videos can build brand awareness at every step of the consumer journey and shorten the sales funnel. Video delivers a compelling sensory experience, allowing brand marketers to highlight value propositions and familiar pain points without aggressively selling a product. The end result is that consumers feel empowered by what they learn and gain the confidence to finalize a purchase.\n\nInteractive Storytelling for Personalized Marketing\n\nCompanies such as Vidyard are leading the movement to make videos less generic and more personalized, making viewers feel invested in the content right from the start. Personalization techniques are especially valuable for B2C applications, allowing marketers to weave a company\u2019s name, website and other identifying information into product demos. While still in its fledgling stages, interactive and 360 video hold the promise of a choose-your-own-adventure experience in which consumers decide how to proceed through the content. In addition to boosting click-through rates, this self-guided model outlines each consumer\u2019s interests and priorities, giving marketers precise data to tailor their content experience in the future.\n\nVideo Analytics for Targeted Marketing\n\nMore insight equals better strategy, and that\u2019s why brand marketers are using video analytics to create results-driven content. Without analytics, the majority of consumer behavior while watching videos goes unseen, and brands cannot be sure whether the content is achieving its goal. Instead of hoping for the best when viewers click \u201cplay,\u201d marketers can use data to determine how long viewers watch videos, what type of content generates the most interest, how often videos are shared and why viewers click away.\n\nIn one case, a marketing company discovered that opening videos with long vanity logos made viewers more likely to stop watching the content \u2014 an issue that could have gone undetected without analytics. In another instance, a company studied the order in which videos were viewed before a purchase. The most minute details, such as the design and sequence of a video, can influence viewing rates. In short, video analytics replace guesswork with hard facts and help marketers match the right content to different buyer profiles and stages of the sales funnel.\n\nBranded Content Libraries for Self-Guided Engagement\n\nWith videos becoming a staple media, companies are recognizing a need for branded libraries. Rather than hosting all of their content on popular social media sites, many companies are providing content libraries on their own websites, making it easy for consumers to pick and choose the information they want to view. Branded libraries offer greater opportunities for marketers to collect consumer data and develop targeted playlists. Product demos, testimonials and video blogs are key examples of immersive content that can encourage customers to imagine how they can use and troubleshoot a product. By delivering answers in one place, branded libraries also keep consumers on the brand website longer, increasing the likelihood of a purchase.\n\nThe Rise of Dedicated Video Marketing Teams\n\nDigital technology trends have a way of creating niche competencies, and video marketing is no different. Instead of using videos to rehash the same advertising messages over and over, smart companies are hiring production teams to create distinct brand stories that leverage the visual and interactive capabilities of video. As new interactive formats emerge, such as personalized, choice-driven and 360 video, marketers must find inventive ways to make consumers feel immersed in the product or brand experience.

Millennial consumers are turned off by one-dimensional marketing messages, and they expect brands to be dynamic entities that have a voice, personality, purpose and social consciousness. Because online commerce has given customers unlimited places to shop, marketers have more chances to reach consumers through ads and more competition vying for attention. Staying up to date on the latest digital marketing trends can help brands develop smart strategies to win over online audiences.\n\nAdvertising Metrics\n\nIn the past, marketers relied on many passive strategies (and guesswork) for measuring the value of ad campaigns. Today, data is king, and brands who pay attention to how customers engage with ads can increase their effectiveness at driving a purchase. With data analytics, marketers can determine the best layouts for websites and the best placement for online ads.\n\nWhen it comes to content marketing, data can be precise enough to tell marketers the factors that kept viewers watching a video or reading a blog, the pages a reader viewed before clicking an ad, or the order in which website pages were viewed. Armed with data about consumer behavior, marketers can test every aspect of a website or ad to produce the most optimized and results-driven content.\n\nCustomer Centricity\n\nMany companies are quick to claim millennials are not brand loyalty, when in reality, this convenience-oriented generation forms strong connections to brands that address their needs. When big brands ruled commerce, businesses had more power to decide what products and features were available to consumers. Now, online shoppers can tap into a global marketplace, and companies that want to survive must satisfy consumer demands.\n\nThe result is widespread customer centricity \u2014 products and services that offer customization and preference-based marketing. Consumers want personalized experiences based on their searches and buying histories, and they stick with brands that help them save time or money by using only the features they need.\n\nMultiple Touchpoints\n\nThe prevalence of digital technology has created more channels for completing transactions, increasing the number and variety of places where consumers can engage with ads. From social media platform and mobile sites to wearable gadgets and smartphone apps, purchases are happening beyond web storefronts. For brands, these diverse touchpoints make it easier to reach consumers earlier in the buying cycle to influence their decisions long before they make a purchase. For example, marketers can use ads to target search traffic when buyers are in the research and planning stages or publish mobile apps that let consumers search store inventories and buy what they need on the spot.\n\nIntegrated Content Strategy\n\nWhen used in conjunction, data analytics and social media allow marketers to understand what consumers value and build brand favorability through repetitive engagement. Consumers are attracted to brands with a consistent message that aligns with their own priorities, especially if the brand provides valuable content without expecting anything in return. Blogs, tutorials, videos, apps, social media profiles and memes are just a sampling of the tools businesses can use to start a dialogue with consumers. Based on the product or service, marketers can develop a well-coordinated strategy to influence consumer opinions about a brand. As the brand builds trust and loyalty, shoppers increase the frequency and amount of their purchases.\n\nApp and Mobile Marketing\n\nConsumers are increasingly gaining confidence in mobile commerce and making split-second purchasing decisions from smartphones and tablets. By creating mobile websites and apps with optimized layouts, businesses make it convenient and tempting for shoppers to handle purchases on the go. Whether they\u2019re making travel plans, searching for the nearest pharmacy or picking up a last-minute dinner, consumers frequently make purchases in the moment as need arises.\n\nShoppers value apps that help them learn, find and do while providing a localized experience when they need to get products on short notice. Although app streaming is still in its experimental stages, the concept of surfing apps without the need for downloads will lead to a significant increase in traffic and visibility for online companies of all sizes. Ultimately, branded apps encourage customers to repeatedly use a company\u2019s product and trust the brand to make valid recommendations, planting the seeds for higher ad engagement.\n\nThe diversification of online marketing is beneficial for brands that want to stand out in saturated industries. While it\u2019s essential for all brands to approach consumers from multiple channels, not every marketing opportunity is right for every brand.

Yet, the level and type of engagement varies for different products and services, and brands benefit from learning which mobile site and app features influence customer behavior. By collecting real-time data, brands can refine their marketing strategies to stay connected to shoppers through multiple stages of the consumer journey.\n\nSite optimization is only possible when brands know why and how consumers use mobile apps. A recent study tracked how mobile users in the United Kingdom interact with apps in three different product categories: retail, finance and travel. The study showed that businesses can improve their sales funnels by promoting features that encourage shoppers to routinely use branded apps for research and planning.\n\nRetail Marketing With Mobile Apps\n\nIn the study, apps in the retail sector were most competitive and had the highest rate of abandonment. Over a 30-day period, 34 percent of retail app users made no purchases, while 51 percent spent \u00a3100 or less. In a market flooded with retail apps for both broad and niche shopping, 44 percent of UK shoppers use them daily. Most users have multiple retail apps installed at once, increasing the challenge of building brand loyalty.\n\nFortunately, the retail audience was also the easiest to regain, as customers are always on the prowl for great deals and quick methods of comparison shopping. Browsing and reading reviews are the top uses for retail apps, and consumers are more likely to increase their interaction if an app offers exclusive benefits, such as discounts and recommendations. In fact, consumers valued apps that retain preferences, helping them find relevant products faster.\n\nFor brands, retail apps provide crucial opportunities to drive buying habits. Roughly 61 percent of UK shoppers used mobile apps to browse product selections, 45 percent made purchases, and more than 20 percent researched products before visiting a store. Today\u2019s customers want a convenient, centralized hub where they can find out what they need, understand the benefits of a product and gain real-world insight from fellow buyers. They also want to stay up-to-date on the latest deals without a lengthy search. Brands that cover all these touchpoints create an uninterrupted pipeline that encourages customers to make a purchasing decision on the spot.\n\nReinforcing Brand Loyalty With Finance Apps\n\nSimilar to retail products, finance apps are used by 44 percent of UK consumers. However, the market is much smaller, and most users only download one or two apps. Security is still a top concern for the majority of consumers, and they are more comfortable with completing retail purchases than banking transactions on mobile devices. Approximately 36 percent of users performed transactions, while the remainder primarily checked for status updates or made payments.\n\nAs a result, brand marketers should promote apps as convenience tools to complement their regular websites and services. While infrequent, transactions in finance apps tended to be high-value, making it worthwhile for businesses to provide a full dashboard of account tools. At the same time, attract customers with money-management features that let them access real-time data on the go.\n\nProvide a Seamless Experience With Travel Apps\n\nIn the travel sector, customers regularly used mobile sites and apps, but showed a slight preference for the latter. With that in mind, travel brands must offer a seamless, positive experience across both media, ensuring customers get the information, deals and payment options they\u2019re looking for. The good news is travel brands have the unique advantage of drawing users who already have a favorable opinion of the company. Most users who downloaded travel apps were acting on word-of-mouth referrals or desired further engagement with the brand.\n\nMuch like finance products, travel apps aren\u2019t typically used for transactions, but customers make substantial purchases when they decide to spend. To keep the travel audience interested, provide apps that include price comparisons, loyalty programs, holiday ideas, discounts and customer reviews. Users specifically value location-based information to streamline the planning process, so gain loyalty by tracking their personal preferences and delivering the most up-to-date data from a wide range of geographic regions.\n\nNo matter where brands do business, knowing the audience is the key to growing revenue and boosting market share.

Thirty-five years ago, seven adults who taught at or ran the McMartin preschool in Manhattan Beach faced criminal charges, which eventually ran into the hundreds, of abuse of children at the school \u2014 and in the most fantastical ways: in naked games, sacrificing animals before children\u2019s eyes, secret tunnels, flying in airplanes.\n\nIt took seven years and $15 million in taxpayer money to wind up with not a single conviction in a case that had, by then, generated many others like it around the country. There was a zeal, even a hysteria, for prosecutions of child abuse crimes that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nRichard Beck detailed them and the consequences in his book \u201cWe Believe the Children: A Moral Panic in the 1980s,\u201d about the lives of children and adults blighted, a justice system \u201cfail\u201d and, more deeply, a backlash against working mothers who paid others to take care of their kids. It was the McMartin case, the longest criminal proceeding in our history, that started it.\n\nClick here for the full archive of \"Patt Morrison Asks\" podcasts \u00bb\n\nThis was a kind of hysteria that spread across any number of states. Can you track back to one moment, to one thing, that got this ball rolling?\n\nI don't know if there's any one single moment that can account for how far the hysteria spread, but certainly Southern California \u2014 the McMartin trial \u2014 was the case that energized the whole thing. It was the first one to receive national news media attention, and in the wake of McMartin getting attention from places like \u201c20/20\u201d or \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d you started to see cases popping up elsewhere.\n\nOne of the things I was really interested to find in my research was that it's not the case that hysterias take off or really get momentum just because someone has a crazy idea that they start spreading around.\n\nThe thing that allowed these allegations to grow and grow and metastasize and really spin out of control was the participation of all of these different institutions in the case: the detectives investigating it, a place called Children's Institute International, where the preschoolers were interviewed using new techniques that had not really been applied to forensic interviews yet.\n\nSo what started as one parent worrying that her son was being sexually abused eventually turned into allegations that every teacher at the school was in on the conspiracy. The list of allegations is really incredible.\n\nBut the mantra you heard over and over again then was, \u201cWe believe the children.\u201d\n\nAnd that mantra was somewhat ironic in light of how the more outlandish allegations were actually produced. You had these interview sessions where therapists would talk to the children who had gone to the school and asked them what had happened, and would essentially, in a nice way, refused to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer.\n\nAgain and again in these interviews, the children start off by saying nothing [happened]: We never played any kind of naked game, it was just normal school games. And then the therapist would ask again and again and again.\n\nThese children are very young; they\u2019re 5, 4, some of them as young as 3.\n\nAnd they eventually got the drift that the interview was not going to be allowed to end until they started telling the interviewer what he or she wanted to hear. And they\u2019re little kids, so when they start making stuff up, it's going to be pretty fantastical.\n\nSo this motto \u201cwe believe the children\u201d is ironic, because if they had believed the children in the first place, things never would have gotten that far.\n\nI think that the children involved in these cases were certainly victims of something. I think it's just that they were victimized by the people who were supposed to be helping them as part of this case rather than by their daycare teachers.\n\nIn the wake of McMartin, there were, as you write about, a series of massive, extraordinary allegations \u2014 in Central California, a child abuse ring with, I think, satanic overtones; in Minnesota, the same thing.\n\nIt really did become a panic on a national level. There were cases in Florida, there were cases in New York. There was a case in Massachusetts. There were cases in Washington state, in Texas.\n\nAnd were all of those cases just about as big a, shall we say, nothing-burger as the McMartin case?\n\nMore or less. You would have some cases where there would be some kind of abuse \u2014 though not very outlandish abuse \u2014 happening that would be the prompt for the initial investigation. But then you would have the allegations and the charges spiral out of control in a similar way, such that even if the case had its roots in something real, you wind up with a lot of people who were totally innocent of any wrongdoing being charged.\n\nAnd yes, there were certainly many cases where it is just sort of a figment of your imagination like it was with McMartin.\n\nPeople did go to prison across the country and in some cases served a long time before they got out, when they were, I believe, factually innocent.\n\nMy recollection is that it was somewhere around 100 or 200 who were convicted and spent time in prison. And it took a long time for a number of them to get out. People did really serious prison time for these crimes that not only they didn't commit, but crimes that didn't occur.\n\nPeople naturally draw parallels to the Salem witch trials, of false accusations by children, young women \u2014 teenage and sub-teen girls in that case. Are those fair parallels?\n\nThe parallel is there, but not sort of for the reasons that people think. Because I don't think of these cases as involving false allegations made by children. I think of these cases as involving false allegations made by adults who use children as their mouthpieces.\n\nAnd in Salem, the situation was similar.\n\nWhen the girls began having their fits, they weren't mostly talking about being harmed by witches. They were talking just as frequently about joyous flights of religious ecstasy and seeing angels come down from heaven smiling at them.\n\nAnd the adults totally ignored those parts of the girls\u2019 ecstatic religious outbursts. They just focused in a really single-minded way on the parts about witches and [the girls] being hurt, and emphasized those.\n\nSo like the daycare hysteria in the \u201980s, the Salem witch trials were a case of adults ignoring things children said that they didn't want to hear, emphasizing or overemphasizing things they did want to hear. And what children had to say for themselves ended up not mattering a whole lot.\n\nHow did the justice system change? Did it learn any lessons from these cases?\n\nI think that's sort of a mixed bag. In terms of developing protocols for interviewing children who have been potentially victimized in one way or another, improvements were made in the wake of this.\n\nA lot was done, especially, to distinguish between a therapeutic interview and a forensic interview.\n\nWhat is the difference?\n\nThe difference is, a therapeutic interview is one that takes as its primary concern the emotional well-being of the child being interviewed. The forensic interview focus is on eliciting the truth of what happened.\n\nThe lines between those two things got blurred over and over again in McMartin, to the detriment of those interviews\u2019 accuracy. So you can call that a positive lesson that the justice system learned.\n\nBut I think in a lot of other ways, it was very destructive. Enormous amounts of power were handed over to prosecutors over the course of the decade, because of the perceived excessive difficulty of getting convictions in cases like this.\n\nAnd if you look at the incarceration rate in the country, and the period during which they started to really explode \u2014 if you think about the fact that prosecutors put those people in prison, I think it's pretty easy to say that the pendulum swung too far in that direction over the course of the \u201980s. ...\n\nWhat role did the press play in the McMartin case and the subsequent cases across the country?\n\nInitially the role was pretty destructive. Local TV news was one of the main engines of spreading the allegations around in Los Angeles during the early days in the McMartin trial.\n\nAnd certainly the \u201c20/20\u201d investigative report on the McMartin trial was appalling. There was a sort of pro forma disclosure about how defendants have to be presumed innocent until found guilty, after which the broadcast pivoted immediately back to the assumption that all the defendants were guilty.\n\nIt wasn't until a little bit later in the decade that you started to see more valuable investigative reporting pop up. So journalism eventually did kind of catch up and begin to do its job. But certainly in the early stages it was part of the problem.\n\nIt's not clear to me, though, that major newspapers have figured out how to apply those lessons in real time. It is certainly possible to look back on your failures and say here's what we did wrong. It's very, very hard to prevent similar failures from happening again when some new kind of hysteria or panic pops up and people are agitated all over again.\n\nWhat got you interested in these child care/daycare ritual abuse charges?\n\nI was part of a little research group in New York. We were researching the legacy of a second-wave radical feminism. As part of that research, I got interested in the anti-feminist backlash that started to happen in the 1980s,\n\nI heard about one of these cases in the course of researching this backlash, because my argument in the book is that ultimately what produced the hysteria was this anxiety about women entering the workforce, the supposed breakdown of the nuclear family.\n\nDaycare then becomes a magnet for a lot of worry, because that's where mothers would leave their children to go work during the day.\n\nThere's this shift happening in how young children are cared for during the day, where the assumption was previously that upper-middle-class mothers would stay at home and take care of their kids. Now they're leaving them with \u201cstrangers,\u201d and who knows what could be happening to them?\n\nI heard about one of these cases while researching this anti-feminist backlash, and the thing that shocked me the most about it initially was that I had never heard of it.\n\nI'm 32 now. I was 24 or so when I started doing this research. And asking around, it became clear to me that people over the age of 40 remember these cases because they'd heard about them in the news, but that people under the age of 30 had never heard of them at all.\n\nFor something to be that big a deal at the time and then to just kind of vanish from historical memory like that suggests to me that there's something about the problem that we were turning away from back then, that are still unresolved today, that still make people uncomfortable.\n\nThere are probably repercussions that you can point to that don't seem evident on the face of it: the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which was about children being held and sexually abused in the basement of a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C., and that Hillary Clinton had something to do with it.\n\nI was thinking about Pizzagate, and there is continuity between the daycare panic and Pizzagate insofar as the daycare panic in the \u201980s really cemented the child molester as like the worst thing you can be in America.\n\nThere's a kind of public contempt reserved for child molesters that isn't even reserved for murderers. In prison populations, child molesters are exposed to especially brutal amounts of retaliation and violence.\n\nAnd I think with Pizzagate, you had these right-wingers on the internet who were looking for something horrible to say about people at the DNC [Democratic National Committee] and stumbled across the idea that, well, what if they're all child molesters?\n\nDid anything good come out of this?\n\nHonestly, I don't think so. You can look at these small improvements that were made to investigative protocols and be grateful for those.\n\nBut this was a tragedy; certainly it was for the people who got caught up in these allegations.\n\nThere's a lot of talk today about people being accused as part of MeToo having their \u201clives ruined,\u201d when in fact it tends to mean that they'll get some negative press coverage for a month or two, and then they'll go back about their business.\n\nBut the people who worked at McMartin preschool really did have their lives ruined by this case \u2014 including the children who got wrapped up in it.\n\nI interviewed one woman; she's an adult now, but she was a child who went to one of these preschools.\n\nShe agreed to be interviewed anonymously, and she talked about the years and years of therapy that were required for her to come to grips with this insane thing that had happened to her, and the guilt she felt about having played a role as a 4- or 5-year-old and sending her innocent daycare teacher to prison.\n\nSupport our journalism Already a subscriber?
