AP PHOTO/JIM MONE\n\nAP announced the addition of a dedicated cannabis team in early 2018.\n\n\u201cOur members and customers have told us this is an area of immense interest to them, and AP\u2019s geographic scope places us in a unique position to tell this story from multiple vantage points,\u201d said AP\u2019s deputy managing editor, Noreen Gillespie.\n\nWe went behind the scenes with Baker to find out how the cannabis beat team covers an ever-changing industry to produce unique multiformat content with local relevance and national impact.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the goal of the cannabis beat team?\n\n\n\nA: To have comprehensive coverage of the evolving cannabis industry in the United States, Canada and beyond.\n\nQ: What type of themes does team cover?\n\nA: It really runs the gamut, and that\u2019s what is so interesting about this topic \u2014 it touches on so many different things. Everyone is affected in some way, and everybody has an opinion on it.\n\nI look back at what we\u2019ve done in a year, and there\u2019s a lot of good material out there, from enterprise to a steady stream of spot news on governmental and political issues to law enforcement to the impact on financial markets. From a customer standpoint, volume and diversity are important, and I\u2019m pleased and proud there are marijuana stories pretty much every day somewhere in the country \u2014 and beyond.\n\nQ: Why did AP decide to dedicate a team to this topic, and what makes it newsworthy?\n\nA: It has become an issue in essentially every state, and there\u2019s a growing sentiment and pressure on the federal government to change its tone when it comes to marijuana and not keep it outlawed like other drugs, such as heroin. We are well-positioned to cover the impact state-by-state and in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat\u2019s driven some of the changes in society\u2019s look at marijuana is the wider acceptance of medical marijuana. There are two groups that are very sympathetic figures and have gotten behind this \u2014 people with cancer and their doctors, and veterans with PTSD. They say they get relief from marijuana, and many people who otherwise might not be supportive of marijuana change their tune when these people say they get relief from it.\n\nQ: What makes our approach unique?\n\nA: We have on-the-ground reporting wherever marijuana becomes an issue. That\u2019s something that nobody else can say.\n\nWe have a lot of good brainpower on the team. It originated out of the West because that region had the most states with legalized marijuana, so we already had people with a good knowledge base covering it and were able to add on in other areas.\n\nFor example, marijuana stocks are blowing up right now, so one of our business reporters has joined the team to focus on the industry and the markets. We also have a former law enforcement reporter from L.A. who is on the team and now covers the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. That\u2019s critical because DOJ is the place where the federal prohibition is enforced, and there\u2019s mounting pressure to reconsider that policy.\n\nQ: How does the team keep up with such an ever-evolving industry?\n\nA: I think the way we keep up is by communicating with each other and monitoring the industry itself. We have people on the team in different states, so they are seeing things at the local level that we can share on group calls, Slack channels, etc.\n\nWe follow developments sometimes at a very granular level, and when we can string them together to see a pattern \u2014 the same thing popping up five times in five different places \u2014 that sets off a lightbulb for the team to look into it.\n\nClick here to find out how cannabis website Leafly uses the multiformat content produced by AP\u2019s cannabis beat team to solidify its news brand and credibility.\n\n"}, {"source": "associated_press", "url": "https://insights.ap.org/industry-trends/learn-how-to-grow-your-audience-and-get-noticed", "text": "Learn more about media and technology with Insights \u2013 join us as we share perspectives from around the industry and provide tips and tricks for how to navigate emerging trends.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the evolving world we live in and the people who work with us around the globe, subscribe to Insights and follow us on Twitter and LinkedIn.

At AP, we\u2019ve used it to consider an array of provocative \u2014 yet plausible \u2014 alternative futures that provide the necessary context to explore new opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential to look ahead and anticipate change,\u201d said Jaime Holguin, AP\u2019s manager of news development. \u201cThe frequency of technological change is exponentially growing, with platforms, trends and opportunities popping up continually in unexpected ways.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we have to be nimble and be able to foresee and adapt to disruptive change.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mayo Nissen, an associate creative director at innovation agency Frog Design, futurecasting shifts organizations\u2019 perspectives in two ways:\n\n1. It causes us to focus on the outcome of our actions, particularly as they impact users, customers and consumers.\n\n2. It forces companies to consider the future, where their actions will have come to life, before working backward to understand what needs to happen today.\n\nMaking these mental leaps can be powerful enough to help organizations think about who and what they want to become, and what they need to do to get there.\n\n\u201cWe work in an incredibly fast-paced news environment, so it\u2019s valuable and necessary to step outside the chaos and think about strategy, and where the news business is going,\u201d said AP Managing Editor Brian Carovillano.\n\nThinking through divergent futures\n\nThe first step we took was to research major events signaling technological, cultural, regulatory and industry changes. We then conducted workshops to extrapolate insights that would help develop future scenario-based forces shaping the future.\n\nNissen highlighted that the key to crafting not just intellectually interesting \u2014 but also useful \u2014 features is to first choose which elements of the present we want to challenge. The goal is then to work internally to make these changes not only possible, but at some deeper level, true.\n\nWe did so by forming a cross-functional and inter-disciplinary group of individuals and immersing them in these possible scenarios to better understand what AP needs to do to be successful into the future.\n\nHypothetical media scenarios\n\nPandas and puppies\n\nThe first scenario included a world where all media consumption and distribution is done through platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. What would be the role of journalists in this hypothetical society?\n\nThe importance of efforts such as fact-checking and user-generated content verification emerged as key areas for future consideration.\n\nThe ad model broke\n\nKeeping in mind the growth of ad blockers, we conceptualized a second future state where advertising no longer exists. How do news organizations generate revenue to fund their journalism?\n\nThis question pointed us to the direction of exploring new business models and to better support our clients with products and services that could justify them charging premium subscriptions to their clients.\n\nChanged consumption\n\nWe also considered the dominant role context-aware devices and the internet of things would play in the next 10 years. How does the news media industry change if consumption and distribution is driven by data collected by smart devices?\n\nPossible answers required us to think about emerging platforms such as smart assistants, driverless cars and smart homes, and the role that news personalization will play in those environments.\n\nSelf-gathering news\n\nThe final scenario materialized around the growth of artificial intelligence and its impact on the news industry. How should media organizations operate in a context where smart machines and algorithms drive the process of newsgathering, production and distribution?\n\nUsing automation to turn data into text stories, leveraging drone journalism to capture different perspectives and developing new forms of data-driven insights all arose as possibilities.\n\nMaking sense of future scenarios\n\nThrough the futurecasting process with Frog Design, we challenged assumptions about newsgathering, production, distribution and consumption \u2014 and considered worlds where each of those stages would be radically different from today.\n\nApplying these artificial stresses on AP\u2019s core capabilities helped us then determine immediate steps to increase not only the organization\u2019s resilience, but also set it up to thrive \u2014 regardless of which of those hypothetical scenarios comes to pass.\n\nBy choosing a longer timeframe, we can ensure that the actions that arise from futurecasting will effect lasting change at the level of corporate strategy and organizational capability, as well as for individual products and services.\n\n\u201cThe most valuable thing I took away from this process is that there are many potential paths forward, but it\u2019s impossible to always know which one is the current one,\u201d Carovillano, AP\u2019s managing editor, said. \u201cSo you set yourself up to be flexible and nimble and to seize opportunities as they arise.\u201d\n\nBuilding future strategies\n\nAs a result of our futurecasting, we developed a company-wide roadmap that includes actions we can take today to remain relevant in the face of inevitable change and uncertainty.\n\n\u201cStrategic planning at AP has always involved looking ahead, but our tendency has been to focus on the near term and the coming year\u2019s budget in particular,\u201d said Jim Kennedy, senior vice president for strategy and enterprise development. \u201cThat inevitably led us to plan for a handful of projects, rather than to imagine the future.\u201d\n\nOvercoming that mindset was critical to driving real transformation and taking the industry lead in content automation and other areas, Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cWe imagined that first set of future scenarios back in 2015, and they have all come true to one extent or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cAnticipating where the world was headed, and where we needed to be, has been a great motivator.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to Insights Sign up to be notified when new posts are published.\n\nFrancesco was the manager of strategy and corporate development at The Associated Press.

While we tap into the experience of our political reporters and the relationships we've built with elections officials in all 50 states, we also adapt day in and day out to serve our customers.\n\nTake a look at the progression of our elections coverage through the decades:\n\n1848\n\nThe 1848 election was the first in which all states voted on the same day and the first in which the telegraph was used to gather returns from all over the country. Dr. Alexander Jones, AP\u2019s first general agent, brought that election and the telegraph together to collect results from the 30 states that voted then. The count went on for 72 hours, and telegraph tolls exceeded $1,000 \u2014 an enormous sum in those days.\n\n1860\n\nOver the years, AP used every available means to secure reliable returns. On Dec. 11, 1860, The New York Times carried a dispatch from Fort Kearney, Nebraska, reporting that the California Pony Express left results to be telegraphed to AP. Included were full election returns from every county in California, showing Lincoln with 38,702 votes and Douglas with 8,060.\n\n1900\n\nBy this year, AP had become the standard for election night reporting. The Washington Post advised its readers of plans to display results on a huge screen in front of the newspaper\u2019s building, including bulletins from AP, so the public could have returns \u201chot from the wires and without a moment\u2019s delay.\u201d\n\n1940\n\nBy the 1940s, counting votes on election night had shifted to the Washington bureau, which managed coverage of the campaigns as well as of the conventions.\n\n1952\n\nThe election in 1952 was notable for another innovation that sped up the vote count for AP by processing punched cards and providing tabular state-by-state results \u2014 an IBM accounting machine. At 1900 pounds, it was almost too big for the freight elevator at the Washington bureau, and required special wiring and extra fuses to run.\n\n1960\n\nGradually, in the 1960s and \u201970s, AP brought computers into the mix, frequently hiring local data processors to tabulate results phoned in to state centers. The AP bureau in New Orleans was a pioneer in computerizing election night vote-counting. The first computerized go-round involved punch cards that, when fed into a processor, produced tabulated returns that then had to be keyed onto AP wires.\n\n2004\n\nAP increased the scope and sophistication of its tabulation and election research efforts, adding systems to deal with delegate counts, algorithms to ensure quality control, and most importantly, an election research team that produces unparalleled data and analysis.\n\nToday\n\nAP now counts the vote in more than 5,000 races during election years, providing raw feeds and interactive data visualizations for customers to ingest and easily display election returns and winners online or on the air."}, {"source": "associated_press", "url": "https://insights.ap.org/industry-trends/report-how-virtual-reality-will-impact-journalism", "text": "The next iteration of immersive media is here.

Recently, we hosted a webinar featuring news directors from the western U.S. and Latin America to describe the results we\u2019ve seen from these efforts in their regions.\n\nBelow are some recommendations they mentioned for achieving success:\n\n1. Foster a video-first environment.\n\nAnna Johnson, AP\u2019s regional news director for the West. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nIn the past, news meetings with our journalists from the western U.S. would often start with a review of the stories \u2014 usually text, by default \u2014 we had published in the past day. Video was \u201clike a separate thing,\u201d said Anna Johnson, AP\u2019s news director for the region.\n\nToday, those discussions often lead off with video or photo plans, and include a recap of how our visuals were picked up by customers. Reporters know to approach each story, planned or unplanned, with video first in mind.\n\nThat thinking \u201creally has to be intentional and deliberate,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt has to be something you do all of the time, not just some of the time.\u201d\n\n2. Start small.\n\nOne initial pilot program we launched focused on California for three weeks with the goal of producing one video story per day from our team based there. In addition to teaching reporters in the field how to film, we also worked with editors in the newsroom to edit the footage as it came in.\n\nIf we didn\u2019t hit the goal, Johnson said, that was OK \u2014 we didn\u2019t want to place too much pressure on anyone too early on. And it invigorated the staff to know that we were able to reach the goal consistently by the pilot\u2019s end without requiring significant additional investment.\n\n\u201cOur efforts have also allowed us to identify top performers and give them more training for ambitious projects that distinguish our coverage,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n3. Emphasize experimentation.\n\nAP News Director for Latin America and the Caribbean Paul Haven (AP Photo/Dario Lopez-Mills)\n\nAP\u2019s news director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Paul Haven, asks his team to aim for a mix of enterprise and breaking video stories.\n\n\u201cHaving the mindset of \u2018Let\u2019s just go take a look \u2026 \u2019 allows you to basically go into peoples\u2019 lives and find interesting stories,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s what Haven and his colleagues did earlier this year when they drove along the 2,000-mile border between the United States and Mexico. In addition to documenting differences on either side, they also broke news by discovering that the number of Mexican refugees in shelters dramatically decreased because of political rhetoric during the past year.\n\nThe project, which also featured time-lapses and 360-video as well as footage from drones and box cameras, served as a case study for the editorial potential of the medium.\n\n4. Hire journalists who have the willingness to learn.\n\nGoing forward, as we look to grow our team, we\u2019ll be on the lookout for reporters who have cross-platform experience, Haven said. More importantly, though, they should have the desire to keep learning different ways to present journalism.\n\nOur journalists around the world today are expected to pull out their smartphone and start recording should they happen upon a breaking news scene. More than half of our staff members in the western U.S. shoot video today on at least a somewhat regular basis \u2014 only a handful are dedicated video journalists.\n\n5. Provide feedback and training opportunities.\n\nPreviously, whenever heat waves struck Arizona \u2014 which they often did and still do \u2014 our reporters would describe the weather\u2019s effects and what they were seeing in words.\n\nWhen it came to video, though, how do you show heat? It\u2019s not like a tornado or even ice or snow. A brainstorming session near the onset of our video efforts yielded the decision to follow the most-popular person in the summer \u2014 the air-conditioning repairman.\n\nWe were able to publish the \u201cday in the life of\u201d story that actually brought audiences along for the ride, much more so than is possible through text alone. Strategizing along with mentoring prove not only to improve peoples\u2019 skills but also keep them consistently engaged, as well.\n\nAfter a story has been published, journalists can now also benefit from real-time feedback from viewers either through commenting on publishers\u2019 websites or social media (even if not all of it is relevant).\n\nSubscribe to Insights Sign up to be notified when new posts are published."}, {"source": "associated_press", "url": "https://insights.ap.org/whats-new/producing-a-tool-that-will-automatically-verify-ugc", "text": "Recently, we were accepted into Google\u2019s Digital News Initiative, a collaboration between the technology company and European publishers to support high-quality journalism.\n\nWe received a grant to develop a tool that newsrooms around the globe can use to automatically verify user-generated content (UGC).

VoteCast is an alternative to the traditional, in-person exit poll, a method that no longer matches how Americans vote today.\n\n\u201cWe threw research, we threw innovation, we threw the best statistical minds that we could find at this problem, figuring out a way to create a more accurate sort of Election Day polling, an alternative to exit polling, that will last for the next 20 or 30 years,\u201d Buzbee said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re pretty happy with the results so far.\u201d\n\nAP race callers declared winners in more than 6,000 races in Tuesday\u2019s elections.

Knight Foundation to expand its team of data journalists, substantially increase the number of data distributions supplied to local newsrooms and establish best practices, including through the creation of a data journalism chapter in the AP Stylebook.\n\n\u201cAP\u2019s data distribution efforts are like rocket fuel for local journalism,\u201d said AP Managing Editor Brian Carovillano. \u201cIn 2018 alone, our data was downloaded nearly 1,400 times by journalists in more than 300 local newsrooms. That translates into hundreds of local stories from across the country that would not otherwise have been told. When paired with AP\u2019s own state- and national-level reporting, this journalism provides a rich, multi-layered look at topics that are essential and newsworthy.\u201d\n\n\n\nA router and internet switch are displayed in East Derry, New Hampshire, June 19, 2018. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nAP organizes and formats data so it can be understood by journalists who don\u2019t have advanced data journalism skills, and posts it on the collaborative data.world platform, where local reporters can mine the data for local stories and visualize the results. They can also ask questions and share story ideas.\n\n\u201cThe data sharing program has been a multiplying force for our data journalism and has helped member journalists wield the power of data for high-impact local reporting,\u201d said Troy Thibodeaux, AP\u2019s data team editor. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortcut for the time-consuming work of vetting, cleaning and understanding the data, but with our distributions, the reach of that work has expanded dramatically.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo build a strong future for journalism we need to make sure our local news organizations are equipped to meet new information demands and deliver quality news,\u201d said Paul Cheung, Knight Foundation director for journalism and technology and innovation. \u201cThe AP\u2019s data team model will help showcase stories that would otherwise go untold; its focus on collaboration and news grounded in data will further advance the role of local journalists in delivering trusted news to communities.\u201d\n\nWith data, supporting materials, explanatory webinars and frequent coaching from AP data journalists, member news organizations are creating distinctive local accountability journalism with real impact.\n\n\u201cData-driven journalism is highly valuable for local news organizations, but so many lack the resources to deliver it on their own. We plan to continue offering local newsrooms the data they need to find and tell fact-based stories that make a difference in their communities,\u201d said Noreen Gillespie, AP deputy managing editor for U.S. News.\n\nSome examples of how local news outlets have used AP data to deliver real-world results include:\n\nWhen reporters from The Detroit News confronted Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson with AP data showing a proposed rent hike for recipients of federal housing subsidies, they were able to be precise: Renters would see a 20 percent increase across the board under the proposal. Carson walked back the proposal on the spot.\n\nSeveral school districts, including Broward County, Florida, and Denver, Colorado, decided they would no longer seek grants from the National Rifle Association after detailed reporting by AP and member news organizations on the number and value of those grants."}, {"source": "associated_press", "url": "https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/sheer-bravery-in-nairobi-attack-coverage", "text": "AP was first to provide live video of the chaos unfolding, and its journalists worked quickly to gather on-camera interviews with witnesses and make photos of police responding and civilians fleeing.\n\nCivilians flee as security forces aim their weapons at the buildings of a hotel complex in Nairobi, Kenya, Jan. 15, 2019.
