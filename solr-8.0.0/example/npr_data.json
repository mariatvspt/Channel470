To this end, NPR reports, produces, acquires and distributes news, information and other content that meet the highest standards of public service in journalism and cultural expression.\n\nOur Guiding Principles\n\nNPR is at its core a news organization. Our news content, whether on the radio, on the web, or in any other form, must attain the highest quality and strengthen our credibility. We take pride in our craft. Our journalism is as accurate, fair and complete as possible. Our journalists conduct their work with honesty and respect, and they strive to be both independent and impartial in their efforts. Our methods are transparent and we will be accountable for all we do.\n\nWe hold those who serve and influence the public to a high standard when we report about their actions. We must ask no less of ourselves. Journalism is a daily process of painting an ever truer picture of the world. Every step of this process - from reporting to editing to presenting information - may either strengthen or erode the public's trust in us. We work hard to be worthy of that trust and to protect it.\n\nThese principles are intended to guide our journalism, both as it is performed and as it is perceived, to help us earn and keep the confidence of the public. The principles exist not only to answer questions, but more importantly, to raise them. By regularly discussing and debating how these principles apply to our work, we will produce journalism worthy of NPR's name and the public we serve.\n\nWho is covered\n\nAll NPR journalists should read and follow the guidance in this handbook. Those who work for shows, podcasts and programming that are not part of the News division should understand that these principles also apply to them. Others at NPR whose work touches our journalism and programming or who have \"outward-facing\" jobs that put them in contact with the public should be familiar with these guidelines. The principles apply to material that comes to NPR from independent producers, member station journalists, outside writers, commentators and visual journalists. Finally, producers of stand-alone programs acquired by NPR and the staffs of those shows should also study and apply the ethical principles and guidance in this handbook. For more details, click here.\n\nOur purpose is to pursue the truth. Diligent verification is critical. We take great care to ensure that statements of fact in our journalism are both correct and in context. In our reporting, we rigorously challenge both the claims we encounter and the assumptions we bring. We devote our resources and our skills to presenting the fullest version of the truth we can deliver, placing the highest value on information we have gathered and verified ourselves.\n\nTo tell the truest story possible, it is essential that we treat those we interview and report on with scrupulous fairness, guided by a spirit of professionalism. We make every effort to gather responses from those who are the subjects of criticism, unfavorable allegations or other negative assertions in our stories. What we broadcast and put online is edited for time and clarity. Whenever we quote, edit or otherwise interpret what people tell us, we aim to be faithful to their meaning, so our stories ring true to those we interview. In all our stories, especially matters of controversy, we strive to consider the strongest arguments we can find on all sides, seeking to deliver both nuance and clarity. Our goal is not to please those whom we report on or to produce stories that create the appearance of balance, but to seek the truth.\n\nWe do our best to report thoroughly and tell stories comprehensively. We won't always have enough time or space in one story to say everything we would like or quote everyone we would wish to include. But errors of omission and partial truths can inflict great damage on our credibility, and stories delivered without the context to fully understand them are incomplete. Our journalism includes diverse voices that reflect our society and divergent views that contribute to informed debate. When we find that we can't deliver all the answers to important questions, we explain what we don't yet know and work to fill any gaps in our reporting.\n\nJournalists who conduct themselves honestly prove themselves worthy of trust. In the course of our work, we are genuine and candid. We attribute information we receive from others, making perfectly clear to our audience what information comes from which source. We avoid hyperbole and sensational conjecture. We may sometimes construct hypotheticals to help explain issues and events, but we reveal any fabrication, and do not otherwise mix fiction with our news reporting. We edit and present information honestly, without deception, and we identify ourselves as NPR journalists when we report. Only in the rarest of instances - such as when public safety is at issue, or when lives are at stake - might we disguise our identity or intent when reporting. Before we take such a step, we engage in rigorous deliberation and consider all alternatives. Then, when we tell the story, we fully disclose what we did and why.\n\nTo secure the public's trust, we must make it clear that our primary allegiance is to the public. Any personal or professional interests that conflict with that allegiance, whether in appearance or in reality, risk compromising our credibility. We are vigilant in disclosing to both our supervisors and the public any circumstances where our loyalties may be divided - extending to the interests of spouses and other family members - and when necessary, we recuse ourselves from related coverage. Under no circumstances do we skew our reports for personal gain, to help NPR's bottom line or to please those who fund us. Decisions about what we cover and how we do our work are made by our journalists, not by those who provide NPR with financial support.\n\nOur experiences and perspectives are valuable assets to our journalism. We enjoy the right to robust personal lives, yet we accept some unique professional obligations and limitations. Because our words and actions can damage the public's opinion of NPR, we comport ourselves in ways that honor our professional impartiality. We have opinions, like all people. But the public deserves factual reporting and informed analysis without our opinions influencing what they hear or see. So we strive to report and produce stories that transcend our biases and treat all views fairly. We aggressively challenge our own perspectives and pursue a diverse range of others, aiming always to present the truth as completely as we can tell it.\n\nTo inspire confidence in our journalism, it is critical that we give the public the tools to evaluate our work. We reveal as much as we practically can about how we discover and verify the facts we present. We strive to make our decision-making process clear to the public, especially when we find ourselves wrestling with tough choices. We disclose any relationships, whether with partners or funders, that might appear to influence our coverage.\n\nWe take full responsibility for our work, so we must always be ready and willing to answer for it. Just as careful attention to our sources makes a story stronger, careful listening to our public makes our journalism better. So we welcome questions or criticisms from our stakeholders and to the best of our ability, we respond. Mistakes are inevitable. When we make them, we correct them forthrightly, reflect on what happened, and learn from them.\n\nEveryone affected by our journalism deserves to be treated with decency and compassion. We are civil in our actions and words, avoiding arrogance and hubris. We listen to others. When we ask tough questions, we do so to seek answers \u2014 not confrontations. We are sensitive to differences in attitudes and culture. We minimize undue harm and take special care with those who are vulnerable or suffering. And with all subjects of our coverage, we are mindful of their privacy as we fulfill our journalistic obligations.\n\nOur journalism is most valuable when we marry important truths with engaging narrative. We take enormous pride in the craftsmanship of our storytelling and in the quality of the words, sounds and images we use to help illuminate the world. When we edit, it is to add impact and clarity to our journalism \u2014 never to slant or distort. We don't allow what is sensational to obscure what is significant. We aspire to tell stories that rise above the maudlin and mundane, avoiding shallow sentimentality. Above all, we do our best to faithfully and powerfully convey the truth.\n\nWe will fulfill the high standard we owe the public if we hold true to our principles. Doing so requires that we embrace complexity and continually think through difficult decisions. While these principles reinforce each other, they also are often in tension. In all situations, we balance them against one another, striving to honor our mission. This statement is intended not only to serve as a guide, but also to provoke ongoing discussion and deliberation - the keys to any ethical decision-making process. It should both test and strengthen the moral compass that guides each of us in our work. It aims to foster a culture that compels and empowers us to exercise our consciences each day. We believe it is our shared responsibility to live up to these principles.\n\nStandards & Practices Editor Mark Memmott writes occasional notes about the issues journalists encounter and the way NPR handles them.

Their spouses in 2017 experienced high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and unemployment, according to a survey sponsored by the Department of Defense and released Thursday.\n\nThe survey reveals a huge swath of nearly a million partners of active duty and reserve troops faced a variety of challenges due to their spouses' service while deployed on active duty or following a move triggered by a new deployment.\n\nOf 367,706 people married to reservists, 92 percent reported feeling an increase in stress levels during their spouse's deployment, while 85 percent said they felt anxious or depressed. It also triggered feelings of isolation \u2014 88 percent said they experienced loneliness.\n\nLove and military marriage\n\nOverall rates of marriage for military members generally match national rate \u2014 about 50 percent \u2014 although, active duty members seem to legally pair off in greater numbers than reserve members.\n\nStill, the report finds female military members, who made up 16 percent of the active-duty force and 20 percent of the Selected Reserve, were less likely to be married than their male counterparts. They were about twice as likely to get divorced.\n\nDual-military marriages \u2014 service members married to other service members \u2014 accounted for 6.6 percent of all married couples.\n\nFinding a job is challenging\n\nThe survey found the unemployment rate for active-duty spouses was exponentially higher in 2017 than the national average at the time. Nearly a quarter of the 612,127 active-duty spouses said they were unemployed, a far greater percentage than Americans outside the military. The unemployment rate for civilian men and women 20 years old and older dropped from 4.4 to 3.7 percent.\n\nAdditionally, those who had been forced to move due to a spouse's new deployment, were twice as likely to be unemployed. Finding a job often took seven months or more after a relocation, the survey found.\n\nUnemployment rates among reservists' spouses appear to be much lower, comparatively, though at 8 percent it is still twice as high as nationwide statistics.\n\nIt's also unusually high considering more than half of reservists' spouses have a bachelor's degree or higher. The national unemployment rate for the same group hovered between 2 to 2.5 percent throughout 2017."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696730998/i-want-justice-r-kelly-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-by-2-more-women", "text": "'I Want Justice': R.

There, they say they were offered alcohol, marijuana and cocaine \u2014 though they say they didn't consume the latter \u2014 and Kelly asked them to meet him in his hotel suite later.\n\nScaff says that Kelly had his genitals exposed when he eventually entered the room. And he allegedly propositioned both \u2014 but Washington, who says she had been recently raped in a separate incident, says she soon left the room.\n\n\"When Kelly was alone with me,\" Scaff told reporters, \"he asked me to perform oral sex on him. I was under the influence of marijuana and alcohol and did it. He then had sexual intercourse with me even though I did not have the capacity to consent.\"\n\nR. Kelly's legal team did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. But Kelly himself has repeatedly denied wrongdoing for years.\n\nThe new claims come amid a rising tide of allegations against the 52-year-old artist, who has been dogged for roughly a quarter-century by reports that he has abused underage girls. For nearly a decade after Kelly was cleared of child pornography charges in 2008, many of those questions quieted \u2014 only to be stirred to life again by a 2017 BuzzFeed investigation.\n\nSince then, more women have come forward accusing the star of sexual misconduct and abuse, including Kelly's ex-wife, Andrea Kelly.

Several cities have already enacted such soda taxes to raise money and fight obesity. And there's new evidence suggesting that these taxes do work \u2014 although sometimes not as well as hoped.\n\n\n\nKris Madsen, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, is one of the researchers who has been studying soda taxes, in part because she's convinced that sugary drinks are a menace to society, a direct cause of obesity.\n\n\"It's a pretty high bar for public health to be able to say that something is causing a major epidemic,\" she says. \"We can do that for sugar-sweetened beverages.\"\n\n\n\nBerkeley was the first U.S. city to tax those drinks, making them more expensive, and Madsen is leading a team of researchers that's trying to see how the tax is working.\n\n\n\n\"We've been going out to the same neighborhoods every year for the last five years, and we've been asking people the same questions,\" she says. Researchers interview people on the street, primarily in low-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nThey started doing this before the soda tax went into effect four years ago, and they've continued every year since.\n\n\"We saw a 52 percent decline in consumption over the first three years\" since the tax went into effect, she says. \"This has a huge impact.\"\n\n\n\nMadsen's study was published online this week by the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nMemories, of course, aren't totally reliable; also, it's possible that people in Berkeley may be underestimating their consumption because they don't want to admit that they're still drinking lots of soda.\n\n\n\nOther researchers, meanwhile, are trying to quantify the impact of soda taxes by looking at sales data from retail establishments, including grocery stores and convenience stores.\n\n\n\nAnna Tuchman, at Northwestern University, is part of a group studying Philadelphia's soda tax. Philadelphia's tax is different from the one in Berkeley. It's bigger, and it also covers both beverages sweetened by sugar and drinks containing low-calorie sweeteners. This is partly because the goal of the tax is largely to raise more money for schools and playgrounds.\n\n\n\nTuchman says that sales of those drinks in Philadelphia have dropped sharply, by 46 percent, since the tax went into effect.\n\nBut there's a catch. \"We find a very large increase in sales of soda and other taxed products at stores that are located zero to four miles outside the city,\" she says.\n\n\n\nBasically, it seems that a lot of people in Philadelphia are driving to stores right outside the city to buy their beverages. This is especially true in the case of sugar-sweetened drinks (and less so of artificially sweetened drinks). When you take that into account, sales in and around the city dropped about 20 percent, not 46 percent. And sales of sugar-sweetened drinks fell even less.\n\nThis gets in the way of both of the city's goals for its soda tax. \"People are able to maintain their sugar and calorie intake, and the city is falling short in their ability to raise tax revenues,\" Tuchman says.\n\n\n\nTuchman and her colleagues are still revising their paper; it hasn't been formally reviewed by other scientists yet. Right now, though, it does show some of the difficulties that cities face with their soda taxes.\n\n\n\nThere are political obstacles as well. The soda industry has been fighting back, arguing that soda taxes are unfair to consumers and won't really make people healthier. In fact, it recently strong-armed California's legislature into reluctantly passing a moratorium on further soda taxes by cities in that state.\n\n\n\nSan Francisco and Oakland, Calif., however, have soda taxes already in place, and Seattle implemented one at the beginning of 2018.\n\n\n\nSoda tax advocates, meanwhile, say that there's a simple way to keep people from avoiding the tax by going outside the city: Just pass a tax that covers an entire state \u2014 or maybe even a whole country.\n\nMexico, in fact, put in place a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in 2014. That tax is smaller than the soda taxes in the U.S., and its effect on consumption also has been smaller. According to one study, consumption of sugary drinks fell on average by about 8 percent as a result of the tax."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696626918/worlds-largest-bee-is-spotted-for-first-time-in-decades", "text": "World's Largest Bee Is Spotted For First Time In Decades\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Clay Bolt/claybolt.com Clay Bolt/claybolt.com\n\nUpdated at 6:40 a.m. Friday\n\nYou might think the world's biggest bee would be easy to find. But that's not the case: Until recently, the last time anyone had reported seeing a Wallace's giant bee living in the wild was in 1981. That changed in January, when the rare bee was spotted on an island of Indonesia.\n\nThe Wallace's giant bee \u2014 Megachile pluto \u2014 towers over European honeybees. The female's size has been recorded as at least an inch and a half long, with a tongue that's nearly an inch long. Add to that a pair of gigantic mandibles, and it's a bee like no other.\n\n\"It was absolutely breathtaking to see this 'flying bulldog' of an insect that we weren't sure existed anymore \u2014 to have real proof right there in front of us in the wild,\" said natural history photographer Clay Bolt, who was part of a small team that sought out the Wallace's giant bee.\n\nThe team found a female bee living in a termite nest on the side of a tree \u2014 the large bee's preferred habitat. Female Wallace's giant bees use resin and wood to create tunnels and cells in existing nests, carving out their own living space away from the termites.\n\n\"To actually see how beautiful and big the species is in life, to hear the sound of its giant wings thrumming as it flew past my head, was just incredible,\" Bolt said.\n\nAbout that sound: Touting its discovery, the team posted b-roll (!) video of the Wallace's giant bee flying around in a small enclosure, its wings sounding like a deep drone compared with the high-pitched buzz of honeybees.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Simon Robson Simon Robson\n\nIt's not unusual for the Wallace's giant bee to go long periods without being seen by humans. It has been observed only a handful of times since it was discovered in the 1850s by British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace. When the bee was last rediscovered, in 1981, it had been presumed extinct.\n\n\"I've been saying it's thought to be extinct,\" said professor Dave Goulson, who heads a bee lab at the University of Sussex. \"I was happy to hear that's not the case.\"\n\nThe breakthrough find came on the final day of a five-day trip to Indonesia's North Moluccas islands. Bolt's visit to Indonesia came as part of Global Wildlife Conservation's Search for Lost Species program. Others on the trip included Princeton University entomologist Eli Wyman; Simon Robson, a biology professor at the University of Sydney in Australia; and Glen Chilton, a professor at Saint Mary's University in Canada.\n\nThe Brobdingnagian bee isn't remarkable only for its size; it also sports unusually large mandibles, which are often compared to a stag beetle's.\n\nThe Wallace's giant bee's mouthparts also include a large labrum; in the early 1980s, entomologist Adam Catton Messer described watching a female Wallace's giant bee using its mandibles to scrape resin from a tree and using its labrum and mandibles to roll the resin into a large ball \u2014 which it then carried as it flew back to its nest.\n\n\"Messer's rediscovery gave us some insight, but we still know next to nothing about this extraordinary insect,\" Wyman said, echoing the reaction of other experts after the bee was spotted anew.\n\nIn theory, Goulson said, the large mandibles are similar to mason bees, which use them to help form the balls of mud that shape their nests. But those apian relatives are nowhere near as imposing as the Wallace's giant bee, he added.\n\nEntomologist Jason Gibbs, who studies bees at the University of Manitoba, says the Megachilidae family of bees use a variety of materials to build nests, from leaves and flower petals to resins and mud.\n\n\"There is an introduced species in eastern North America, Megachile sculpturalis, which is closely related and quite a large and dramatic bee to see,\" Gibbs said. \"Megachile pluto is like that species dialed up to eleven.\"\n\nIn the early 1980s, Messer found several Wallace's giant bees living in mountainous terrain of three islands in the North Moluccas, near the equator.\n\nThat remote location is a main reason the Wallace's giant bee has been seen so infrequently, said Goulson, who has written several books about bees. And now, he added, that sheer remoteness might help protect it from anyone seeking to get into the bee-poaching business and sell a rare specimen.\n\nBolt and Wyman say they want their discovery to draw attention to the bee \u2014 and to the need to protect it. The world's largest bee faces potential risks that range from insect collectors to the loss of its habitat from palm oil operations and other activity.\n\nGibbs agrees with the idea that bringing more attention to Wallace's giant bee might help protect it. He also says there was a flurry of interest last year, when a single specimen fetched a price of more than $9,000 on eBay.\n\n\"Despite an abundance of potential nesting sites, the bee appears to be rare,\" Messer wrote of his rediscovery in the 1980s. \"Local informants had never seen the bee prior to its rediscovery, although a specific folk epithet, o ofungu ma koana, 'king bee,' is based on it.\"\n\nAs has been the case with other historical perceptions about bees, the king bee turned out to be a queen: The females are far larger than the males, which measure less than one inch in length."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696561080/email-shows-n-c-gop-candidate-sought-out-operative-accused-of-illegal-ballot-sch", "text": "New Election Called In North Carolina House Race\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Travis Long/Pool/News & Observer Travis Long/Pool/News & Observer\n\nUpdated at 5:16 p.m. ET\n\nAfter months of insisting that he knew of no illegal activity being done on behalf of his campaign, Republican Mark Harris, who leads the race for North Carolina's 9th Congressional District, called Thursday for the State Board of Elections to hold a new election.\n\nShortly afterward, the bipartisan state board voted unanimously to redo the only congressional race left from the 2018 midterm elections that remains undecided.\n\n\"Through the testimony I've listened to over the past three days, I believe a new election should be called. It's become clear to me that the public's confidence in the 9th District seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted,\" said Harris.\n\nIt was a dramatic and humbling reversal for Harris, a pastor who until now had insisted that the elections board certify his 905-vote lead over Democrat Dan McCready in the unofficial tally so that he could take a seat in Congress.\n\nFour days of hearings had left that position increasingly untenable as witnesses detailed how an operative hired by Harris illegally handled absentee ballots, a felony in North Carolina. One witness said she filled in unmarked sections of ballots. Harris' own son testified on Wednesday that he had warned his father that the operative's tactics were likely illegal.\n\nAn email first released to the public on Thursday shows that Harris requested a meeting with the operative, McCrae Dowless, in March 2017 after losing a primary election in which one of his opponents had hired Dowless.\n\nThe disclosure by the Harris campaign frustrated investigators, who were presented with the evidence only on Wednesday, despite a subpoena from the North Carolina State Board of Elections for the relevant documents months ago.\n\nA \"shady character\"\n\nIn December, the board declined to certify the results of the election. Instead it voted to open an investigation into an absentee ballot scheme that investigators have now been unspooling for months. Election board staff said that the investigation will continue even as preparations are made for a new race.\n\nThe investigation focuses on Dowless, who was hired by Harris to run get-out-the-vote efforts in Bladen and Robeson counties. Dowless was also investigated in 2016 for his tactics, which a number of witnesses have testified included illegally collecting absentee ballots and filling out some of those ballots.\n\nHarris has said publicly since the investigation began in December that he was unaware of any illegal acts that may have been done on behalf of his campaign. He reiterated that in his testimony Thursday.\n\n\"He said we do not take the ballot,\" Harris said, describing what Dowless told him. \" 'I don't care if it's a 95-year-old woman in a wheelchair. We do not take the ballots.' \"\n\nThe email produced by the attorney representing Harris' campaign showed Harris reaching out to former judge Marion Warren about procuring Dowless' help. Dowless worked for another candidate, Todd Johnson, who nearly swept Bladen County's absentee ballot totals in 2016, and Harris refers to that victory in his email.\n\n\"On the other issue of your gracious offer to meet me in Bladen County and spend a day connecting me to the 'key people' that can help me carry that part of the county in a future US House NC-9 race,\" Harris wrote to Warren on March 8, 2017. \"You know the political and financial connections better than anyone else I would know, including the guy whose absentee ballot project for Johnson could have put me in the US House this term, had I known, and he had been helping us.\"\n\nBut Harris' son, John Harris, testified Wednesday that he warned his father that he thought Dowless was a \"shady character\" who likely engaged in illegal practices as part of his operation.\n\nJohn Harris says he reviewed the absentee ballot results of the 2016 race and concluded that Dowless was using illegal tactics to help Johnson.

He was 77.\n\nHis death was announced on his official Facebook page and website. \"Peter succumbed to a 10 year bout with adenoid cystic carcinoma, a rare cancer of the salivary glands,\" it read.\n\nThe Monkees were a made-for-TV musical group whose comedic high jinks and misadventures were fashioned after the Beatles' classic films A Hard Day's Night and Help!\n\nTheir show debuted in 1966 and lasted only two seasons. But it did win an Emmy in 1967 for outstanding comedy series. The Monkees became overnight stars, producing a series of No. 1 hits such as \"Last Train to Clarksville,\" \"Daydream Believer\" and \"I'm a Believer.\" Their record sales in 1967 surpassed the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined.\n\nDespite their commercial success, including six Top 10 songs and five Top 10 albums, critics hammered them for their manufactured pop cultural genesis and the fact that, initially, they didn't perform on their own records.\n\n\"Almost all of their early material was penned by a stable of vaunted songwriters that included Carole King, Gerry Goffin, Neil Diamond, David Gates, Neil Sedaka, Jeff Barry, Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart,\" according to the Washington Post, and \"the songs were mostly done by session musicians.\"\n\nBut their popularity was real. Eventually, the band took control of its work and played its own instruments on its third album, Headquarters. They also began touring to sold-out crowds. For a brief time, their opening act was a young guitarist named Jimi Hendrix.\n\nTork left the group in 1968 and sought a solo career. He struggled throughout the 1970s, was jailed for possessing a small amount of hashish, and wound up teaching high school and waiting tables. Alcohol was also a problem, an addiction he overcame in the early 1980s.\n\nA combination of 1960s nostalgia and TV reruns kept memories of the Monkees alive and earned them a new generation of fans. The band had reunion tours every decade since the 1980s.\n\nAll along, Tork and the others defended the band's musical integrity and rejected the criticism that the Monkees were only a fabrication of older TV producers seeking to capitalize on 1960s youth culture.\n\n\"I refute any claims that any four guys could've done what we did,\" Tork said in an interview with GuitarWorld in 2013. \"There was a magic to that collection. We couldn't have chosen each other. It wouldn't have flown. But under the circumstances, they got the right guys.\"\n\nTork was born Peter Halsten Thorkelson in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 13, 1942. Trained as a musician, he played a variety of instruments, including guitar, bass guitar, banjo and keyboards.\n\nAnother member of the band, singer Davy Jones, died in 2012.\n\nAs recently as 2016, Tork marveled at the power of nostalgia and the band's ability to draw a crowd, even when most of the music was produced with the aid of side musicians.\n\n\"This is not a band,\" Tork told the Telegraph. \"It's an entertainment operation whose function is Monkee music. It took me a while to get to grips with that but what great music it turned out to be! And what a wild and wonderful trip it has taken us on!\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696694642/israel-set-to-launch-spacecraft-to-the-moon", "text": "Israel Launches Spacecraft To The Moon\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 11 p.m. ET\n\nAn Israeli spacecraft blasted off this evening, aiming to land on the moon. And if the mission is successful, it would make Israel the fourth country to land a spacecraft on the lunar surface \u2013 after the U.S., the former Soviet Union and China.\n\nIt would also be the first privately initiated project to do so, although it was assisted by government partners, as Nature notes. \"The feat seems set to kick off a new era of lunar exploration \u2013 one in which national space agencies work alongside private industries to investigate and exploit the moon and its resources,\" Nature added.\n\nThe spacecraft, which is called Beresheet (Hebrew for \"in the beginning\"), was launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla.\n\nIt was initially conceived as part of Google's challenge called the Google Lunar XPRIZE for a private company to complete a soft landing on the moon. The Israeli non-profit SpaceIL was one of five international teams in the running for the $20 million grand prize; Google announced last year that the contest would end with no winner because no team was prepared to launch by the deadline. Still, the Israeli engineers at SpaceIL continued to work toward landing a spacecraft on the moon.\n\nThe spacecraft launched with a Space X Falcon 9 rocket, according to SpaceIL's partner Israel Aerospace Industries. It detached from the reusable rocket, which returned to an off-shore platform.\n\nThe spacecraft was to make several orbits around Earth, slowly getting closer to the moon. In a difficult maneuver, it was to pivot from orbiting Earth to orbiting the moon, and then eventually attempt a treacherous landing on the moon.\n\n\"For many months, our teams and IAI's were engaged in testing the spacecraft and its systems, conducting complex experiments and preparing for every possible scenario of the mission, whose success will make Israel an extremely proud nation,\" Ido Antebi, the CEO of SpaceIL, said in a statement.\n\nThe total journey will take about two months, with a landing anticipated in mid-April. According to IAI, it would be the \"longest journey until landing on the moon, 6.5 million kilometers.\"\n\nBeresheet is covered in gold-colored reflective coating. And as WMFE's Brendan Byrne reported, it's about the size of a kitchen table.\n\n\"The countries that have done this before \u2014 China, Russia and the United States \u2014 have done it with a budget of billions of dollars,\" SpaceIL adviser Dafna Jackson told Byrne. \"We didn't have that budget. We are on a budget of $100 million.\"\n\nIt's carrying a digital time capsule which, according to The Jerusalem Post, contains \"drawings by Israeli children, the Bible, the national anthem, prayers, Israeli songs and a map of the State of Israel, among other cultural items.\"\n\nThe spacecraft is set to run experiments on the moon's surface \u2013 in particular, SpaceIL says it will collaborate with the Weizmann Institute of Science and UCLA to \"take measurements of the Moon's mysterious magnetic field.\"\n\nSpaceIL has said that it wants to spark an Israeli \"Apollo Effect,\" a reference to the successful U.S. space program.\n\nAnd, it may also have the effect of inspiring government programs. As the BBC notes, \"Both the US and European space agencies have stated their intention to use commercial landers to deliver some of their scientific payloads to the Moon.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696770940/roger-stone-barred-from-talking-about-his-case-following-criticism-of-judge", "text": "Roger Stone Barred From Talking About His Case Following Criticism Of Judge\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jose Luis Magana/AP Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nUpdated at 6:34 p.m. ET\n\nA federal judge on Thursday barred Roger Stone from talking publicly about his case after an inflammatory photo was posted on his Instagram account of the judge that included what appeared to be a crosshairs.\n\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson rejected apologies offered by Stone, both in writing and in person at a hearing in Washington, D.C.

Says Brutality In S. Sudan May Rise To War Crimes\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Akuot Chol/AFP/Getty Images Akuot Chol/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHuman rights violations and abuses that have grown routine against civilians and children in the world's youngest country, may constitute war crimes, according to a new report by the U.N.'s Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan outlining acts of brutality committed in 2018.\n\nNearly eight years after South Sudan gained independence from its northern neighbor, Sudan, a civil war has mired the country in a humanitarian disaster.\n\n\"There is a confirmed pattern of how combatants attack villages, plunder homes, take women as sexual slaves and then set homes alight \u2013 often with people in them,\" said Commission Chair Yasmin Sooka in a statement about the report's findings, which covers 2018. \"Rapes, gang rapes, sexual mutilation, abductions and sexual slavery, as well as killings, have become commonplace in South Sudan.\"\n\nThe report does not name perpetrators, but says they are believed to come from many sides of the conflict including the army, rebel and armed groups, the National Security Service, as well as two unidentified state governors.\n\nA ceasefire was declared in South Sudan in June, 2018, followed by the signing of a peace deal, which resulted in a marked decrease in fighting. However, \"hostilities have persisted,\" the reports says, adding that the peace deal also did not address South Sudan's disastrous humanitarian situation. \"Due in large part to the conflict, 60 percent of the South Sudanese population is severely food insecure, and there remain 2.2 million refugees and 1.9 million internally displaced persons.\"\n\nChildren make up the majority of South Sudan's displaced. They are often alone \u2014 separated from their parents and especially vulnerable to violence. Armed groups have recruited thousands of South Sudanese child soldiers, the reports says, while more children are still being abducted and forced to fight.\n\nSometimes children are caught in the crossfire of ongoing military operations and sometimes they are targeted, the Commission finds. It recounts reports of remarkable brutality, including children being shot in the back as they try to run away, and in one case, a baby being swung against a tree.\n\nSexual and gender-based violence is an ongoing tactic of warfare used \"by all parties to sow terror,\" the report says. Sexual violence against children includes the rape of girls as young as seven. Boys and men also suffer, but their stories of sexual violence are under-reported, due to social stigma, the report finds.\n\n\"There is no doubt that these crimes are persistent because impunity is so entrenched in South Sudan that every kind of norm is broken even raping and killing the young and the elderly,\" said Commission member Andrew Clapham at a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday.\n\nThe Commission says it is continuing to collect evidence of human rights abuses and other crimes with an eye toward their being applied toward justice mechanisms. It says it has three case studies documenting war crimes, which it will pass along for potential prosecution.\n\n\"We think that through accountability and reconciliation there's the possibility for the South Sudanese to deal with the past and secure their future stability and prosperity,\" Clapham said.\n\nCentral to the conflict, the report finds, is South Sudan's near total economic reliance on oil. The \"increased militarization and securitization of the oil industry by Government forces,\" who are working to protect their own economic interests in the oil sector, risk \"turning South Sudan into a police state built on fear, rent-seeking and corruption,\" the report says. Further, oil revenues are being used to fund the fighting.\n\nAnd while the report focuses on last year, Clapham notes that intense fighting goes on in the state of Central Equatoria between government forces and a militant group. \"A scorched earth policy\" has led to torched homes, civilians being killed and women and girls raped. Thousands of civilians have been displaced in the latest burst of fighting."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696400737/when-sheriffs-wont-enforce-the-law", "text": "When Sheriffs Won't Enforce The Law\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ted S. Warren/AP Ted S. Warren/AP\n\nLast fall, voters in Washington state approved a package of firearms restrictions, generally called I-1639. It raises the minimum age for buying semi-automatic rifles, tightens background checks and makes it a crime to fail to store a gun safely, if the gun ends up in the wrong hands.\n\nThe restrictions have raised the ire of some county sheriffs.\n\n\"My plan is not to enforce it,\" says Klickitat County Sheriff Bob Songer.\n\nSonger is one of about a dozen sheriffs, mostly in rural parts of the state, who have come out against the law. Some say they will apply certain measures \u2014 for instance, the background checks \u2014 but will ignore others. One sheriff said he is not going to arrest a 20-year-old farmer who happens to have a semi-automatic rifle with him on his tractor.\n\nSonger is more absolutist. \"As an elected sheriff and a constitutional sheriff, I believe it violates the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,\" he says, \"and, more specifically, violates the Washington state Constitution.\" Songer adds he won't enforce it unless \u2014 and until \u2014 the Supreme Court says it is constitutional.\n\nDoes a sheriff really have the right to do this?\n\nRobert Wadman, a former police chief and a professor emeritus at Weber State University, says professional discretion is a constant feature of policing, as cops decide, for example, whether to arrest someone for simple drug possession or wait to see if they can follow the little fish to a bigger drug dealer.\n\n\"There's a litany of decision-making processes in almost every phase of policing, from the street to the leadership,\" Wadman says.\n\nWhile he believes there's no \"recipe\" for figuring out when discretion crosses an ethical line, he thinks publicly refusing to enforce a law on constitutional grounds goes too far.\n\n\"I would not go down that path,\" he says. He thinks the Washington sheriffs' motivations are political, and he says, \"For me, questions of this nature should be answered by the courts \u2014 not the court of public opinion.\"\n\nRichard Mack, on the other hand, says the Washington sheriffs are doing their duty. Mack is a former Arizona sheriff who in the 1990s successfully challenged a federal law requiring state officers to do gun purchase background checks. Since then, he has popularized the term that Songer uses to describe himself, \"constitutional sheriff.\"\n\nSheriffs are seeing laws being made potentially by voters in urban areas and feeling like they need to protect their population from these people who have very different attitudes about the way the world should be.\n\n\"Sheriffs standing for freedom have the responsibility to interpose \u2014 it's the 'doctrine of interposition' \u2014 whenever anybody is trying to diminish or violate the individual rights of our counties,\" Mack says.\n\n\"Constitutional sheriff\"\n\nMack runs an organization called the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, which has offered courses in this line of thinking to law enforcement officers. Mack won't disclose the names of sheriffs who have joined the association, so it's hard to gauge his influence.\n\n\"It is a thing that exists,\" says Mirya Holman, an associate professor of political science at Tulane University who has studied the attitudes of hundreds of sheriffs around the country. She says many are aware of Mack's doctrine, but their adoption of those ideas varies.\n\n\"There are sheriffs that endorse this; there's also, though, a lot of sheriffs that wouldn't fully endorse it but like some of the ideas that are contained within it,\" she says, such as the notion that federal authorities should notify local sheriffs whenever they perform law enforcement in that county.\n\nHolman says the \"constitutional sheriff\" idea is fed by the political polarization in Western states \u2014 the Washington gun initiative, for instance, was passed primarily by voters in metro Seattle.\n\n\"Sheriffs are seeing laws being made potentially by voters in urban areas and feeling like they need to protect their population from these people who have very different attitudes about the way the world should be,\" Holman says.\n\nOthers point to more sinister roots for the phrase constitutional sheriff. Jared Goldstein, a professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, has written extensively about popular ideologies of this kind.\n\n\"It dates back to a movement from the '60s and '70s called the Posse Comitatus movement, that itself came out of the Ku Klux Klan,\" he says. \"That isn't to say that there's a moral equivalence to the Klan and these constitutional sheriffs. But the idea that they can refuse to enforce laws that they disagree with is just the same.\"\n\nMack, the former Arizona sheriff, rejects that analysis.\n\n\"He's full of baloney and he obviously does not know me,\" Mack says. \"Because that is not where this comes from.\"\n\nMack says his ideas would encourage sheriffs to refuse to enforce any law that violates civil rights \u2014 including the Jim Crow laws of the segregationist South.\n\nSheriffs have enormous autonomy\n\nIdeologies aside, elected sheriffs have extraordinary freedom to pick and choose which laws to enforce.\n\n\"They have an enormous amount of autonomy,\" says Holman. \"I'm not sure that there is another office that is a common office that has anywhere like the level of autonomy that sheriffs have.\"\n\nThe notion of an autonomous, elected law enforcement chief is uniquely American, and some wonder whether it still makes sense.\n\nWhat perhaps made the sheriff attractive during westward expansion makes it obsolete at best and dangerously anachronistic at worst today.\n\nLast year, an analysis of the institution of sheriff in the Virginia Law Review by James Tomberlin concluded that the office of elected sheriff had outlived its usefulness.\n\n\"What perhaps made the sheriff attractive during westward expansion makes it obsolete at best and dangerously anachronistic at worst today by preventing local governments from acting as a meaningful check on the office's powers and holding the sheriff accountable,\" Tomberlin wrote.\n\nFew states have curbed sheriff autonomy. One exception is Connecticut, where voters in 2000 eliminated the office of \"high sheriff\" after a series of scandals.\n\nIn Washington state, the sheriffs' autonomy is largely unquestioned. The only option for supporters of the new gun law is to call for the sheriffs to be voted out of office in the next election. The Democratic attorney general, Bob Ferguson, sent the sheriffs an open letter warning that they might be held liable \u2014 that is, sued by a private party \u2014 if their refusal to conduct background checks resulted in a gun crime.\n\nThe Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, accused the sheriffs of \"a futile kind of grandstanding,\" and he told them to leave it to the courts to decide whether a law is constitutional. But he also tacitly acknowledged his lack of authority over them, by saying he will tell the State Patrol to enforce the law in counties where the sheriffs won't."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696600114/family-reunites-with-dog-who-went-missing-during-the-deadly-camp-fire", "text": "Family Reunites With Dog That Disappeared During The Deadly Camp Fire\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ben Lepe/AP Ben Lepe/AP\n\nAfter the deadliest wildfire in California's history last year, one family that fled has received a little joy.

Carrying an EpiPen. Sitting at the special lunch table at school. These anxiety-ridden measures have become routine for families with severe food allergies, who know it takes only one wrong bite to end up in the emergency room.\n\nNearly 6 million U.S. children and teens \u2014 about 8 percent, or two per classroom \u2014 have food allergies. In children, allergy to peanuts, which can be life-threatening, has gone up more than 21 percent since 2010.\n\nSome of these kids \u2014 as well as adults with severe food allergies \u2014 are trying a new treatment. And they're not waiting around for the Food and Drug Administration to approve it. The treatment, known as oral immunotherapy, involves consuming tiny amounts of the trigger food, with gradual increases in dose. Over time, the immune system learns to react less vigorously to the allergen.\n\nBecause there's not yet an FDA-approved version of this treatment, most medical providers don't yet offer it. So most patients can get it only by enrolling in research studies, of which there have been dozens in recent years.\n\nWhen Whitney Block, a clinical research nurse who helped run oral immunotherapy trials at Stanford University, saw that more than 2,000 people were on the waitlist to get into these studies, she decided to start offering oral immunotherapy on her own. In 2017, Block, a nurse practitioner specializing in the treatment of allergies, opened her own clinic, National Allergy Center, in Redwood City, Calif., and just launched a second site in Southern California.\n\n\"What I've done and continue to do in research trials I've brought out to private practice to make it available to more people,\" Block says. Patients have flown to the clinic from the East Coast and even from Bulgaria and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBlock joins a small but growing number of providers around the U.S. who have begun offering the therapy without enrolling patients in trials. Just four board-certified allergists offered oral immunotherapy for food allergies in 2010, but the number surpassed 100 by 2017, according to the website OIT 101, which is run by parents who've had success with oral immunotherapy and maintains a directory of providers.\n\nThe therapy is not a cure. People who get the treatment still have to read labels and cannot eat whatever they want. And the vast majority have to continue the treatments indefinitely to keep their tolerance. For peanut allergy, for instance, they would need to continue to consume roughly one peanut per day.\n\nYet for many, to be able to tolerate even one or two whole peanuts without symptoms is life-changing. \"It provides that additional margin of safety,\" says Dr. Brian Vickery, an allergist-immunologist at Emory University. \"By undergoing this type of treatment, they can move around in the world with more peace of mind.\"\n\nVickery was the lead author of a paper published in November 2018 in the New England Journal of Medicine that described encouraging results from a placebo-controlled study of peanut protein capsules developed by Aimmune Therapeutics. (He formerly worked at and serves on the board for Aimmune Therapeutics.) While it's possible for clinicians to offer the treatment simply with commercially available peanut flour, Aimmune's product, AR101, offers a standardized dose suitable for rigorous study and FDA approval.\n\nThe South San Francisco biopharmaceutical company tested AR101 in 551 peanut allergy sufferers at 66 sites. At the end of the 12-month trial, more than two-thirds of the group taking the active drug were able to tolerate a dose of peanut protein equivalent to about two peanut kernels. Based on Aimmune's recent results, the company submitted a licensing application to the FDA for its peanut capsules in December. It could be approved in 2019, and approval could lead to broader use of the treatment and to insurance covering it.\n\nDBV Technologies of Montrouge, France, is developing another form of immunotherapy that delivers peanut protein to the immune system through a small skin patch. The company plans to resubmit a licensing application for this product, Viaskin Peanut, in response to the FDA's request for more data on manufacturing procedures and quality controls.\n\nWhile these products work their way toward approval, the vast majority of providers are not yet offering oral immunotherapy to their patients, except as part of a research trial. \"Physicians are concerned that without FDA approval, if something goes wrong, they're going to be held liable,\" says Dr. Christina Ciaccio, a pediatric allergist at the University of Chicago Medicine, who has helped run trials for companies developing peanut allergy treatments.\n\nAt a national immunology meeting in San Francisco this Sunday, experts will debate whether the treatment is ready to go mainstream. The \"yes\" side will be presented by Dr. Richard Wasserman, who started offering the treatment to patients at Dallas Food Allergy Center in July 2008. Since then, the clinic has treated more than 800 people for allergies to 20 foods. \"The response of patients and families to oral immunotherapy has been the most rewarding thing I have done in 40 years of medical practice,\" Wasserman says.\n\nOn the \"no\" side is Dr. Robert Wood, a pediatric allergist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who has published a study that noted that the degree and duration of protection offered by immunotherapy is unknown and that allergic reactions are common during the treatment.\n\nMany families find the therapy stressful. At some points during the regimen, often on days the doses increase, most patients experience skin rashes, itching in the mouth, abdominal pain and other unwelcome side effects. And it doesn't work for everyone. In the recent trial of Aimmune's peanut capsules, 10 percent of the participants 17 and under who received the active drug needed rescue epinephrine during the exit food challenge at the end of the study.\n\n\"If you have lived your life thinking this stuff is poisonous and can kill you ... and now the treatment is in fact ... to take a little bit of it in food every day, that's a difficult thing for people to wrap their heads around, particularly when they start to experience symptoms,\" Vickery says.\n\nIn addition, immunotherapy requires certain precautions that can hinder daily activity. For instance, patients must avoid exercise, hot showers and anything else that elevates the body temperature for several hours after dosing.\n\nBecause of the difficulty of the treatment and the risks, clinicians caution against patients trying this on their own. \"There is potential for serious side effects,\" warns Block. \"You definitely need medical oversight.\"\n\nOral immunotherapy treatment \"is not going to be suitable and appropriate for everyone,\" says Ciaccio. But she says emerging treatments for food allergies \"will continue to be a hot topic.\"\n\n\"We need more than one \u2014 just like we need more than one treatment for diabetes,\" she says.\n\nEditor's note, 3/1/2019: This story has been updated to include information about the researchers' relationships with companies developing pharmaceutical products for the treatment of allergies.\n\nEsther Landhuis is a freelance science journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area.

If it fails to do so, Day said he would entertain a defense motion for release.\n\nHasson faces a misdemeanor drug charge and a felony weapons possession charge related to illegal drug use.\n\nCourt documents indicate Hasson espoused extremist and white supremacist views for years \u2014 aspiring to establish a \"white homeland\" \u2014 and say he is a \"domestic terrorist bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect government conduct.\"\n\n\"I am dreaming of a way to kill every last person on earth,\" Hasson wrote in a draft email dated June 2, 2017, that was uncovered by investigators, according to the court records.\n\nThroughout the email, addressed to \"friends ... Acquaintances more likely,\" he contemplates the most effective methods to \"cause complete destruction\" by unleashing a biological attack on the public, followed by contamination of food supplies.\n\n\"Much blood will have to be spilled to get whitey off the couch. ... They will die as will the traitors who actively work toward our demise,\" he wrote disdainfully.\n\nThe rambling and inchoate letter also includes a to-do list for the next four years, revealing Hasson's desire to \"Get out of debt!!!! Buy van to convert, diesel, Buy land for family out west or possibly NC mtns.\" He also adds that he needs to \"come off\" tramadol, a narcotic painkiller. \"Clear my head,\" he says.\n\nOfficials arrested Hasson last Friday.\n\nIn recent years, the government contends, Hasson has been on a weapons buying spree, collecting 15 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds of mixed ammunition \u2014 all of which were confiscated from Hasson's basement apartment last week.\n\nDuring the raid, officials also discovered Hasson's computer, containing a spreadsheet that reportedly is a hit list of possible targets \u2014 high-ranking current and former Democratic politicians, activists, political organizations and media personalities.\n\nIn addition to Pelosi, Hasson was allegedly considering some type of violent assault on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Richard Blumenthal, along with U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Maxine Waters and former House member, Beto O'Rourke. The spreadsheet list also included MSNBC hosts Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough, as well as Don Lemon and Van Jones from CNN.\n\nThe court filings paint a picture of an angry and drugged man who has been seeking answers in neo-fascist and neo-Nazi literature for decades and who is desperate to make a \"lasting impression on this world.\"\n\nApparently, Hasson frequently sought instruction from a manifesto written by Anders Breivik, a far-right, anti-Muslim Norwegian nationalist who was convicted in 2012 of two terror attacks that killed 77 people. According to officials, Hasson used Breivik's methods to hone his list of potential victims, conducting Internet searches for \"most liberal senators\", \"where do most senators live in dc\" and \"are supreme court justices protected.\"\n\nHasson's drug use also appears to stem from directions in Breivik's manifesto, \"taking narcotics in order to increase his ability to conduct attacks.\"\n\nThe documents state that when agents searched his apartment, they found documentation indicating Hasson ordered \"at least 4,200 Tramadol 100 mg pills\" since 2016. In searching his workspace, officials said they discovered at least 100 pills of the synthetic opioid and a locked container, filled with more than 30 bottles labeled as human growth hormone, prosecutors wrote.\n\nHasson has been working at the U.S. Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, D.C., since 2016. He was an active duty member at the time he was arrested. Prior to that, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1988 to 1993 after which he joined the Army National Guard for about two years.\n\n\"An active duty Coast Guard member, stationed at Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington, DC, was arrested last week on illegal weapons and drug charges as a result of an ongoing investigation led by the Coast Guard Investigative Service, in cooperation with the FBI and Department of Justice,\" Coast Guard spokesman Barry Lane told NPR in an emailed statement."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696593870/chicago-police-empire-actor-jessie-smollett-faked-attack", "text": "Jussie Smollett 'Took Advantage Of The Pain And Anger Of Racism,' Police Say\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AP Kamil Krzaczynski/AP\n\nUpdated at 10:45 a.m. ET Friday\n\nWeeks after Jussie Smollett reported being assaulted in a potential hate crime, the Empire actor has been released on bail after police questioned him for allegedly orchestrating the attack. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett faked the incident, paying two brothers about $3,500 to join a \"publicity stunt\" staged by Smollett because he \"was dissatisfied with his salary.\"\n\n\"Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,\" Johnson said at a news conference Thursday after Smollett's arrest.\n\n\"I'm left hanging my head and asking why,\" he continued. \"Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?\"\n\nThe Cook County State's Attorney's Office has approved disorderly conduct charges against Smollett for allegedly filing a false police report.

He came back yesterday from out of state, knowing charges were imminent. He surrendered this morning at 5 a.m. and wants nothing more than to clear his name.\"\n\nLess than a day later, the executive producers behind Empire announced that they plan to write Smollett's character off the program for at least the end of its current season.\n\n\"The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

The actor and musician, who is black and gay, said two individuals had accosted him with racist and homophobic slurs, beaten him and placed a rope around his neck before fleeing.\n\nHe also said that he had received a threatening letter using racist and homophobic language a week earlier \u2014 though police now say that, too, was falsified in an attempt \"to gain attention.\" \"When that didn't work,\" Johnson explained, \"Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud.\"\n\nDetective Cmdr. Edward Wodnicki laid out an exhaustive timeline of how police arrived at this conclusion, saying they relied on security footage and tips from the community to identify the two brothers Smollett allegedly enlisted. They had flown to Nigeria shortly after the incident, but authorities were at Chicago O'Hare International Airport waiting to detain them when they returned to the country on Feb. 13.\n\nNational What The Jussie Smollett Case Means For The Black LGBTQ Community What The Jussie Smollett Case Means For The Black LGBTQ Community Listen \u00b7 4:41 4:41\n\nJohnson said it wasn't until the very end of their interrogation that the brothers decided to confess. \"It wasn't until the 47th hour of their 48-hour hold time \u2014 that we could legally hold them in custody \u2014 that it took a change,\" Johnson said, adding that it was at that point that the brothers implicated Smollett.\n\n\"The brothers agreed to cooperate in the investigation,\" Risa Lanier, a prosecutor with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, explained during the bond hearing later. \"As more evidence \u2014 such as text messages, phone records, social media records, bank records, surveillance video and the receipt from the purchase of the rope \u2014 was obtained by investigators, this investigation shifted from a hate crime to disorderly conduct.\"\n\nJohnson put it more bluntly.\n\n\"When we discovered the actual motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off \u2014 you know, because we have to invest valuable resources.\"\n\nAnd he expressed frustration not only at Smollett's conduct but also at the amount of media attention it has received.\n\nJohnson said he is also \"concerned\" about what Smollett's alleged actions mean for future victims of hate crimes. \"My concern,\" he said, \"is that hate crimes will now publicly be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn't happen.\"\n\nAccording to statistics recently published by the FBI, there was a 17 percent jump in hate crimes from 2016 to 2017.

Studies show members of such communities were arrested and jailed for illegal marijuana use far more often than whites.\n\nAs Massachusetts developed laws for legal marijuana, officials wrote what they claimed was a first-in-the-nation Social Equity Program explicitly to give members of those communities a leg up.\n\nBut this part of the state law isn't working \u2014 next to no black or Latino candidates have applied for licenses in Massachusetts.\n\nThey're scared of the government.\n\n\"They're scared of the government, man,\" said Sieh Samura, an outspoken cannabis activist. \"This is still a new thing.

We're a pro-growth community, but we want to make sure regular folks are able to participate in that.\"\n\nSamura, an Iraq War veteran, said medical marijuana was a big help for him dealing with the effects of PTSD. As a black man, he sees himself as a marijuana pioneer from a community that has long been targeted. He says this fraught relationship between law enforcement and communities of color is why many black and Latino entrepreneurs are reluctant to start recreational marijuana businesses.\n\nTo be a model for others, Samura and his wife Leah created a recreational marijuana business called 612 Studios. For months they've been coming to a massive marijuana cultivation facility in Milford, Mass., to participate in The Sira Accelerator, a 12-week program designed to get more people of color into the industry by doing everything from raising money, to helping with marketing, packaging and distribution.\n\nThis program is run by Sira Naturals, which grows marijuana and creates products for its own medical dispensaries and some other recreational businesses. Mike Dundas, Sira Naturals' CEO, said the company wants to help longtime marijuana advocates, like the Samuras, or folks who have been dabbling in the illegal pot market.\n\n\"We see our program, the Sira Accelerator, as sort of offering a hand to those who've been operating \u2014 and have skill and passion and dedication to cannabis products \u2014 in the illicit marketplace, to come to the regulated side, to get on the books and help facilitate the start of their businesses,\" said Dundas.\n\nIn return for the advice and counsel, Sira takes just under a 1o percent stake in the new company.\n\nSira also hopes the accelerator will help it open a recreational shop in Somerville, where it already runs one of three medical dispensaries. The company can't get a recreational license until black or Latino entrepreneurs do because of the city's ordinance. Dundas, who is white, admits he's scrambling to find and mentor people of color who want to open businesses in Somerville to ensure that his company can open a retail shop of its own.\n\nKaren O'Keefe, director of state policies with the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, said there have been lots of attempts around the country to help candidates from black and Latino communities, but none have worked.\n\n\"None of the states have the kind of diversity that we would like to see in the cannabis industry,\" she said.\n\nSome marijuana business owners have expressed frustration that states are \"picking winners and losers\" in the marijuana industry. But O'Keefe argued that this industry is different, given the ill effects of the war on drugs.

The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed.\n\nRowe was among the first women to file a gender pay-equity claim under the Massachusetts Equal Pay Act (MEPA), which went into effect last July. Her case was being closely followed by the classical music industry as well as by those interested more broadly in gender parity issues.\n\nRowe was hired in 2004 by the BSO \u2014 an ensemble widely considered one of the top orchestras not just in the U.S., but worldwide \u2014 to serve in this high-profile and extremely competitive position. According to the suit, she has appeared as a soloist with the orchestra more than any other BSO principal musician in the fifteen years since she was hired, and has been heavily promoted in the orchestra's publicity and marketing campaigns.\n\nThe BSO and Rowe's lawyer, Elizabeth A.

Former BSO principal flutist Doriot Anthony Dwyer was a trailblazer when she joined the orchestra in 1952, the same year that the BSO became the first orchestra to implement a blind audition process. This process was designed to promote fairness and to address the issue of gender imbalance, among other issues, in orchestras throughout the country at that time. In the same spirit of improvement and innovation it demonstrated more than six decades ago, the orchestra will continue to collaborate with musicians, staff, and other leaders in the field to accelerate the process of achieving gender parity. The BSO and Elizabeth Rowe look forward to continuing their shared commitment to artistic excellence at the highest level.\"\n\nAccording to a 2016 study, about 47 percent of musicians in U.S. orchestras were women; the number of female players has improved significantly since the widespread introduction of \"blind\" auditions in the 1970s and '80s, in which musicians' genders are masked by screens and with carpeting, to muffle the sound of women's shoes.\n\nBut female composers continue to be sorely underrepresented in orchestral programming in this country: According to an analysis from the Institute for Composer Diversity, a clear majority of American orchestras have programmed at least 90 percent of their 2019-20 seasons with music written by men. (As of now, the numbers for composers of color are even more dismal.)\n\nThe group's figures are being continually updated as orchestras announce their upcoming seasons; the BSO, for one, has yet to announce its programming for 2019-20."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/08/691740052/to-halt-hiv-advocates-push-for-prep-outreach-to-black-women", "text": "To Halt HIV, Advocates Push For PrEP Outreach To Black Women\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\n\nIn 2013, not quite a year after the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug Truvada for HIV prevention, a coalition of 50 experts in HIV and women's health called on U.S. public health agencies to promote the pill and its approach, called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, explicitly to women.\n\nNot much happened.\n\n\"No one until recently spent time talking about PrEP for women,\" says Dr. Dawn K. Smith, biomedical interventions implementation officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"I think we need to have a clearer message: If you're at risk for HIV, you should consider this. It can work for you.\"\n\nAnd women are at risk, especially black women. After gay men and transgender women of any race, who have the highest risk of infection, black women are the group most vulnerable to HIV, according to the CDC. And while PrEP has been proven to reduce new HIV diagnoses when used consistently, it's mostly white gay men who have benefited so far.\n\nSo as President Trump pledged this week to reduce HIV rates in the U.S. by targeting HIV transmission hotspots, black women say that their communities ought to be a focus.\n\n\"The unequal roll-out of PrEP to women must be resolved in the new plan,\" says Leisha McKinley-Beach, a national HIV/AIDS consultant and a member of the the coalition that argued for PrEP for women in 2013. McKinley-Beach says she has been frustrated to see little change in the rates of HIV transmission among blacks, both men and women, while rates among white men dropped by 10 percent since 2011. \"We want the same outcomes for our communities,\" she says.\n\nNo matter what comes of the Trump administration's plans, public health researchers and grassroots advocates are already tackling the problem. McKinley-Beach works with a group of black women in Atlanta, where some neighborhoods have high HIV rates, raising awareness among women that PrEP is for them too. Nationally, groups like the Black AIDS Institute and the Black Women's Health Imperative, have started campaigns to reach women. And they're using different tactics than those that work to reach gay men.\n\nThe PrEP gap\n\nAbout 1.1 million Americans are at high risk for HIV and could benefit from PrEP, according to the CDC. Around half of those are black men and women, who have the highest HIV risk burden of any race. But only 1 percent of PrEP prescriptions have gone to black people of any gender, according to data the CDC's Smith presented at an HIV conference in 2018. And only 10,000 women of any race were using the pill to prevent HIV.\n\nThe CDC suggests people consider PrEP if they have any of several risk factors for infection, including if they are in a relationship with someone who is HIV-positive or whose status they don't know, if they are in a relationship that's not mutually monogamous, are dating and having sex with more than one person, or don't use condoms consistently.\n\nThere's one more risk factor that often affects black women even if they have none of the others, explains Dr. David Malebranche, an HIV researcher at the Morehouse School of Medicine. Simply living in an HIV hotspot area, such as those that the president's plan aims to reach, can raise your odds of exposure. In Atlanta, for instance, there are some ZIP codes where the HIV rate is as high as 1.9 percent, while others are as low as 0.14 percent.\n\nBlack women make up 62 percent of all new HIV diagnoses among women\u2014despite accounting for just 13 percent of women in the U.S. And yet, according to a study published in January, knowledge about PrEP among women is low, particularly for black and Latina women.\n\nPerhaps this lack of knowledge stems from the fact that PrEP has been talked about almost solely in the context of gay men, \"particularly white gay men,\" says Rasheeta Chandler, a researcher at Emory University specializing in women's sexual and reproductive health and an advance-practice nurse in HIV care.\n\nEven she didn't connect the dots between the new HIV prevention pill and the women she was studying and treating until years after first hearing of Truvada. \"I just filed it away as a new prevention effort that had a biomedical capability,\" she says.\n\nNow it's the focus of her work.\n\nIn Chandler's most recent study presented at the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care Conference in 2018, two-thirds of the college-age black women she spoke to had never heard of PrEP. And while a chunk of them said they would probably \"pass on the pill,\" 67 percent said there was a chance they might take PrEP in the future.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\n\nIf low rates of PrEP use continue among the women who could most benefit from it, it may undermine efforts to ease the HIV epidemic for those women, says Rachel Jones, an associate professor in the School of Nursing at Northeastern University.\n\n\"If we don't adequately promote HIV prevention in black women, we risk seeing HIV infection boomerang in this population,\" she says. \"We have got to stop the epidemic in men. We've got to stop it in [gay and bisexual men]. But we cannot forget about HIV infection in women.\"\n\nBlack women helping black women\n\nAt a conference room in an Atlanta hotel recently, a group of black women gathered to talk to each other about how to protect themselves from HIV.\n\nThe event, put on by local nonprofit SisterLove is just one local effort, led by black women for black women, to spread the word about PrEP. Another group, called Atlanta Black Women Leaders on PrEP, which McKinley-Beach is part of, is also mobilizing to raise women's awareness of PrEP. McKinley-Beach is creating palm cards\u2014small cards about the size of a business card that women can keep in their purses\u2014listing the handful of Atlanta clinics that offer PrEP to women.\n\nLater in 2019, SisterLove plans to open a clinic dedicated to prescribing PrEP to women, particularly black women. When it does so, it will significantly increase women's access to PrEP in the city.\n\nMeanwhile, the local Planned Parenthood office is looking into offering PrEP to women in Atlanta. And all these efforts are being amplified by national efforts by Planned Parenthood and other public health nonprofits to get PrEP in the hands of women.\n\nThis all comes as the nation's preeminent organization for health prevention efforts, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, recently endorsed PrEP in a draft recommendation as a recommended HIV prevention method for all people of any gender at high risk for HIV.\n\nIn almost all of these programs, the messages to black women are different than those public health officials are using to reach gay men. While for gay men, the message has often been about alleviating anxiety about dating and sex, the messages to black women present PrEP as part of an overall health and wellness strategy, and focus on empowering them to protect themselves.\n\n\"The momentum is building,\" McKinley-Beach says. \"It's getting birthed out of a need.\"\n\nBlack women 'deserve good sex'\n\nIf more Atlanta clinics offering PrEP to women were around a year ago, Brittany M. Williams' experience might have been different. Williams, 28, a doctoral candidate at the University of Georgia, heard there was a pill that could prevent HIV from her gay black male friends years ago. But at the time, she was more focused on her general health.\n\n\"If you look at [all the health conditions] that African Americans can have, that's what my family history looks like,\" she says, listing off diabetes and hypertension among other conditions.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\n\n\"I'm trying to make sure I'm not that person,\" she says. \"I'm out here running half marathons and I'm vegan every now and then.\"\n\nAnd she's been insisting on HIV tests since she was an undergrad in college.\n\nLast year, she was dating a man who was living with HIV. He was on treatment and had an undetectable viral load, which meant he couldn't pass it on to her. Still, it got her thinking about her favorite uncle, who died of AIDS-related complications. And she thought of friends, women who had acquired HIV the first time they'd had sex.\n\nBut when she went to a women's clinic on campus, where she gets her HIV and STIs tests, they told her they didn't prescribe PrEP. For that, she'd have to track down a doctor at another clinic who was known to prescribe the pill. It took a trek across campus and all afternoon, but she left that evening with a prescription for Truvada. A self-admitted germaphobe (\"I follow the CDC on all social media,\" she says), she also uses condoms to protect herself from other STIs and pregnancy.\n\nShe and her boyfriend have since broken up. But she continues to date. And she continues to take Truvada.\n\n\"It just makes me more comfortable,\" she says. \"I'm doing something for me. It's not dependent on anyone else.\"\n\nShe even mentions it in her online-dating profile. If PrEP was more visible and accessible, she says, it would have been clearer to her that \"women can and should use PrEP.\" As it was, she had to forge the path on her own.\n\nAnd maybe she would have had better answers for the women who quietly messaged her on Twitter and Instagram, asking her about the pill and how they could get it, too. (Those women declined to comment for this story.)\n\n\"Black women deserve sex and they deserve good sex,\" she says. \"But it should always be safe, and this is another way to ensure that.\"\n\nHeather Boerner is a science journalist based in Pittsburgh, and the author of Positively Negative: Love, Pregnancy, and Science's Surprising Victory Over HIV."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696532333/coast-guard-officer-faces-domestic-terrorism-charges", "text": "Coast Guard Officer Accused Of Being A Domestic Terrorist\n\nHe is in custody in suburban Washington, D.C. Court papers indicate the suspect, a self-described white nationalist who stockpiled weapons, wrote that he wanted to kill as many people as possible.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe FBI has arrested a Coast Guard lieutenant who lives in a suburb of Washington, D.C. And the allegations against him are grim, to say the least. According to court documents, the suspect is a self-described white nationalist who stockpiled weapons and wrote that he wanted to kill as many people as possible. The suspect allegedly had a list of potential targets that included Democratic political leaders like Nancy Pelosi, as well as cable TV news anchors. NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre is here to tell us more.\n\nHi, Greg.\n\nGREG MYRE, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: What do we know about the suspect?\n\nMYRE: So his name is Christopher Paul Hasson. He's an active duty Coast Guard lieutenant, age 49. And he was working at the Coast Guard headquarters here in Washington for the past three years, had an office job. It was part of acquisitions. He did a lot of scheduling and fairly routine stuff. He's had a military career that dates back to the Marines and the Army National Guard in the '80s and '90s.\n\nBut he's also, it seems, a white nationalist. He's expressed neo-Nazi views. He's talked about being - written about being a skinhead for 30 years. And he feared the white race was being destroyed. And he was calling for a white homeland. The prosecutors call him a domestic terrorist. And the very first line of their court filing expresses how they think about him. The defendant intends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.\n\nMARTIN: Wow. What do we know about how they uncovered his plot?\n\nMYRE: Well, we know the Coast Guard started investigating. We don't quite know what tipped them off, but they launched it. And then the FBI went to the Coast Guard headquarters and arrested Hasson last Friday in the parking lot.\n\nThey also went to his house, which is a basement apartment in Silver Spring, Md. - suburban Washington. And they found quite a cache of weapons there - 15 firearms, including pistols or handguns, rifles and semi-automatic weapons, more than a thousand rounds of ammunition. He had steroids and other narcotics he had been stockpiling - apparently thought this would make him stronger for an attack. And this stockpiling had gone on for about two years, it seemed.\n\nMARTIN: What was the connection among all the people who he had listed as potential targets?\n\nMYRE: It really seems they were quite critical of President Trump - these Democratic leaders that he'd been putting on a spreadsheet and also listing along with some of these cable news anchors. Often, he would just write one name. But it seemed quite clear he was talking about Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator Tim Kaine, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and others. And then these cable hosts on CNN and MSNBC, sort of the evening hosts - Chris Hayes and Ari Melber at MSNBC, Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo. And then there were more than 20 names altogether.\n\nMARTIN: I understand that you were able to talk with at least one of the suspect's co-workers.\n\nMYRE: Yeah, I did - a guy named Adam Stolsberg (ph). And he says that Hasson was sort of a normal, quiet guy. He didn't talk about things outside of work. He had a lot of tattoos. He drove a Harley. And they knew he'd been arrested last Friday. But they didn't know why. And he says he and, he's sure, others were really shocked when they heard this sort of bombshell announcement about the kind of charges that are being brought against Hasson.\n\nMARTIN: Do we know, at this point, if he had any connections to any groups? Or was he acting alone...\n\nMYRE: So...\n\nMARTIN: ...Planning to act alone?\n\nMYRE: As far as we know, not - he seemed to be acting alone.\n\nMARTIN: All right.

Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nHouse Democrats plan to file a resolution Friday seeking to block President Trump's emergency declaration aimed at securing funds for building a border wall.\n\nThe \"resolution of disapproval,\" led by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, received the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a letter Wednesday to lawmakers in both parties.\n\n\"I write to invite all Members of Congress to cosponsor Congressman Joaquin Castro's privileged resolution to terminate this emergency declaration,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that the House will \"move swiftly to pass this bill.\"\n\n\"The President's decision to go outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process violates the Constitution and must be terminated,\" she added.\n\nThe president issued his emergency declaration after Congress failed to approve his demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the southwest border as part of the annual Homeland Security spending bill. A stalemate over the issue caused a partial government shutdown earlier this year.\n\nThe shutdown ended when Trump signed a spending bill allocating $1.375 billion for border fencing. The emergency declaration would allow him to divert an additional $6.7 billion in funds from other government projects to the border wall.\n\nSixteen states, led by California, have filed a lawsuit arguing that \"the President has used the pretext of a manufactured 'crisis' of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency.\" The states say Trump's action is unconstitutional because only Congress, not the president, has the authority to control spending.\n\nApproval of the resolution is widely expected in the Democratic-controlled House. A vote by the full House is expected in mid-March. If the House passes the resolution, then the GOP-controlled Senate would be required to take it up.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether there are sufficient numbers of Republicans senators who would join Democrats in approving the resolution. One moderate, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she would support the resolution. But with the Republicans holding a 53-47 majority in the Senate, three other Republicans would have to join Collins for the resolution to have a chance at passage.\n\nOther Republican senators have expressed their displeasure with the emergency declaration and some face tough re-election fights so they might risk bucking the president on the unpopular border wall.\n\nHowever, even if the House and Senate voted to approve the resolution, reaching a threshold of a two-thirds majority in each chamber in order to override a presidential veto is not likely."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/20/695083431/surviving-r-kelly-producer-dream-hampton-takes-on-ecosystem-that-s-supported-him", "text": "'Surviving R. Kelly' Producer Dream Hampton Takes On Ecosystem That Supported The Star\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nLast week, reports surfaced of a new videotape showing singer R. Kelly engaging in sex acts with an underage girl. This is not the first time the R&B superstar has been accused of sexual abuse. Allegations have circled Kelly for decades; in 2002, a videotape surfaced that purportedly showed Kelly engaging in sexual acts with a teenage girl.\n\nUntil recently, the accusations did not seem to significantly impact Kelly's career. Though Kelly was indicted in 2002 on 21 counts of child pornography, a Chicago jury later acquitted him of all charges in 2008.\n\nBut activist, filmmaker and writer dream hampton isn't about to let Kelly off the hook. hampton executive produced Surviving R. Kelly, a six-part docuseries focusing on Kelly's alleged victims and their family members. hampton says the series, which first premiered on Lifetime on Jan. 3, is currently streaming on Lifetime's website and will re-air on Feb. 25, is about \"centering the women.\"\n\nhampton describes an \"ecosystem\" that has supported and enabled Kelly over the years \u2014 at the expense of black women. \"There's a record industry that continued to do business with him in small and big ways,\" she says.\n\nBut hampton hopes that the tide is finally turning. She notes that the grassroots #muterkelly movement has raised awareness in the music industry and helped limit the radio play of Kelly's songs. Since the series aired, Sony Music dropped Kelly and Spotify downgraded him. Still, hampton says, \"we've seen five million streams of his music happen directly after the docuseries aired, and we saw two of his songs re-chart.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn allegations against R. Kelly being well-known in his hometown of Chicago\n\nIt's really well-known in Chicago, for generations ... He would cruise McDonald's near high schools and have someone from his team go up to a girl, get her number and she didn't have to be anything. She didn't have to have long hair or short hair. [She could] be light skinned or dark skinned and have a great body or a bad one. All she had to be was young. And so, we have lots of evidence of him cruising not only McDonald's, but then also his old high school, Kenwood Academy, which was a kind of school that was renowned for its excellent music program and choir. Sometimes as a guest sometimes just as a drop-in, he would cruise girls at his high school.\n\nOn the videotape that allegedly showed Kelly sexually abusing a teenage girl\n\nI didn't watch it until I began making this docuseries. ... I avoided it because I thought it to be child porn just from the descriptions. But when I actually saw it, it had nothing to do with sex. It was all about barking commands at and humiliating and degrading this young, young girl.\n\nShe appears to be prepubescent, but we later learned that she was Sparkle's niece, and there was whole trial about that case. Sparkle was an R&B singer who lived in the studio. She was being mentored by R. Kelly. He was producing and writing her album. So, he met that victim because her aunt lived in the studio, as one does when one's recording an album, and her family, who were a family of musicians, would come by. He met her, Sparkle says, as early as 12.\n\nOn criticism that the survivors didn't go to the police\n\nThat confounds me, especially coming from black people. I really didn't know until I started reading these tweets directed at me and some of the survivors that we had some fantasy about there being some vice squad dedicated to kind of busting down doors for black girls and to save black girls.\n\nWe also have testimony ... about the Chicago Police Department giving R. Kelly a heads up when one of the parents, for instance, had convinced the police to do a wellness check on their daughter. At this point, she was over 18. They couldn't really make a claim, but they begged the police to at least check on their daughter and make sure that she was OK.\n\nSomeone in the Chicago Police Department \u2014 likely someone who worked security on their off-duty hours \u2014 called him, and told him it was happening. And they got the studio ready and got the girls out of the studio before the police arrived.\n\nOn a pattern in the black community of protecting black men at the expense of black women\n\nWe know that this system is unfair to black people \u2014 not just black men, but black people. We often rhetorically talk about black men being targeted and treated unfairly and abused in the criminal justice system \u2014 but it's black people.\n\nWe know what this system does to us, right? So to turn to that system for justice is itself an oxymoron. But at the same time, we have a knee-jerk reaction to protect black men, always at the expense of black women. People like bell hooks and black feminists before me have written about this and talked about this and done scholarship about this, but nothing has changed about this. ...\n\nSo this is something that we see generation after generation, and R. Kelly has a particular kind of love, which acts as a currency in the black community. He is singularly an R&B artist. He makes black music for black people ... and he has used that love as a cover.\n\nR. Kelly has a particular kind of love, which acts as a currency in the black community. He is singularly an R&B artist. He makes black music for black people ... and he has used that love as a cover.\n\nOn R. Kelly being sexually abused himself as a child\n\nWhat R. Kelly was as a child was raped and molested. He uses the word \"molested.\" ... So he has some kind of understanding. ... [People on his team] knew that he was abused. Many of them there were Chicago-based people who knew that family members had been abusing him as a child. That's deep trauma that needs real healing.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images\n\nI'm not saying that at 52, which is the age R. Kelly is right now, when he has two very young women living with him, whose parents are looking for them, that there's some magical age when you are supposed to have a healing, because many people don't heal their entire lifetimes. I have childhood trauma that I'm still trying to heal and I'm five years younger than R. Kelly. ...\n\nIt's clich\u00e9 to say, but almost all abusers have been abused, but not all people who have been abused become abusers. So there comes a time when R. Kelly is absolutely responsible for the harm that he's caused.\n\nOn why she wants to do this work\n\nWhen I started writing about hip-hop as a 19-year-old film student in New York, I was calling out the misogyny and the violence against women. And I'm sad to say I don't feel that there's been too much progress made.\n\nI come from all-black Detroit city and I live and breathe in black spaces. And I want them to be safe not just for my daughter and me, but [also for] black women who don't want that safety for themselves, who've internalized the misogyny and don't think that they deserve the safety and justice that they deserve.\n\nHeidi Saman and Thea Chaloner produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

Now, college students around the country \u2013 from University of Virginia to Ohio State University \u2013 are remaking the show in between classes and homework. At least six campuses post their Survivor re-creations on YouTube. Others are competing, but haven't posted their episodes yet. And around 20 schools reached out about starting their own versions, Trupp says.\n\n\"I think the moment of real emotion, real fights, real anger, real joy, are what make this more than just like an extracurricular \u2013 it makes it an actual experience that makes it something worthwhile,\" says Anders Norberg, former host of Survivor Maryland. Norberg graduated in May, and now lives in Los Angeles where he's working in the entertainment business.\n\nSurvivor Maryland's 12th season kicked off with the Solo cup challenge on Feb. 10. The challenges, tribal councils, secret meetings and confessionals are all recorded and edited into episodes and then posted on YouTube. (You can watch previous seasons here and here.)\n\nAnd as some Survivor fans are gearing up for the premiere of the 38th season of CBS' Survivor on Wednesday, the 18 players of Survivor Maryland are fully focused on the game unfolding on their campus.\n\ntoggle caption Olivia Sun/NPR\n\nGame culture\n\nThe campus shows have taken on a life online \u2014 and have an extremely devoted fan base.\n\nThere are super fans. They tune into live steam recaps of the newly released episodes, some which have more than 25,000 views on YouTube.\n\nOne super fan, Jack Estavanik of Ramapo College of New Jersey, spends a few hours a week updating wiki pages he created for Survivor Boston, Survivor Maryland and Survivor Michigan. Recently, an immunity necklace used in season 5 of Survivor Maryland sold for more than $380 on eBay. And past Survivor Maryland player Alex Paskal says fans have reached out to him from as far as Peru.\n\n\"I find this Survivor fan base as a whole to be a bizarrely varied group of people,\" says Alex Thal, a former contestant on Survivor Michigan. \"It seems like you almost just take the most random possible subsection of America and you get Survivor fans.\"\n\nJust like on the real television show, the campus contestants are split into tribes and vote each other out. Contestants use various strategies \u2013 from forging alliances to outright deception \u2013 as they strive to be the last person standing and ultimate survivor.\n\nThe emotion and the drive and everything is so real and so raw, you don't get that anywhere else. You probably won't get it for the rest of your life after this.\n\n\"There were definitely times where people cried, people were in distress, people were furious at each other,\" Norberg says. \"Like, friendships ended because of the game.\"\n\nHowever, while there are similarities between the TV and campus versions \u2013 the tiki torch props, the hidden immunity idols and the drama \u2013 there are key differences. Survivor lasts 39 days, whereas the college shows last one semester \u2013 anywhere from 75 and 100 days depending on the school. The television series offers a $1 million prize for winning, while most college shows offer $100. And there's no tropical island.\n\nBut the biggest difference: the game takes its cues from campus life. Red Solo cups. Players in university-themed gear. Crew members recording footage not with a big video camera rig, but on smartphones. And it's primarily self-financed.\n\nThis game screams college.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olivia Sun/NPR Olivia Sun/NPR\n\nThen there's the strategizing.\n\nContestants have tricked other players into thinking some of them were hooking up, spent hours searching campus for hidden clues or even bought fake idols to trick other players. One player even hid in another contestant's closet for hours to avoid being seen colluding.\n\n\"If you want to do well in the game on a social level, you have to put in that amount of time,\" says Amani Desormeaux, a past Survivor Maryland player who admitted to skipping class to strategize. \"If I wasn't in class, if I wasn't sleeping, I was doing Survivor.\"\n\nThal says he spent 20 hours a week playing and strategizing. Chris LeCompte, a two-season Survivor Maryland veteran, says the game starts to blend with real life.\n\n\"You're always thinking about it, and you're always on, because the thing about it is it's not a clock-in-and-clock-out-type ... game,\" he says. \"It really is a live 24/7 game.\"\n\ntoggle caption Olivia Sun/NPR\n\n'Huge Survivor family'\n\nExecuting a show like this is a mammoth undertaking.\n\nBefore each season, hosts spend months planning out each week's challenge and interviewing potential contestants. George Jayne, former host for Survivor Michigan, received 130 applications for the first season of 18 contestants. Host of Survivor Boston Jacob Falberg says he focuses on making sure the chosen players have the drive to win. That means interviewing everyone who applies, which at its peak was 60 applicants.\n\nIn addition to the host and cast, a crew of anywhere from five to 20 students constantly films during challenges, so no moment goes unseen. And for Survivor Michigan, there's an entire social media team along with an editing team dedicated to the show.\n\nTrupp says for his last season as host, he had to sift through 300 hours of footage while editing it, which took about two years. The season aired in 2018.\n\nNorberg, who is currently editing his seasons as host, spends 15 hours editing the show each week \u2013 basically whenever he isn't at work, he says. He releases a new episode of season six every Monday.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Noah Fortson/NPR Noah Fortson/NPR\n\nWhile critics say playing the game cuts into schoolwork, many contestants say they received higher grades when they played the game.\n\n\"That was my best semester ... academically because it made me be more in tune with my time management,\" says Survivor Maryland crewmember Swale Nida.\n\nEven through the turmoil and backstabbing, most players end up as friends and many return in later seasons or become part of the crew.

The 56-year-old jazz trumpeter from New Orleans has been Spike Lee's right-hand composer since Jungle Fever in 1991.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nCrazy as it sounds, Spike Lee is up for his first Oscar for directing. It's for \"BlacKkKlansman.\" Equally hard to believe, Lee's longtime composer Terence Blanchard is up for his first Oscar, too. Tim Greiving talked to both of them about what that means.\n\nTIM GREIVING, BYLINE: Terence Blanchard was on the soundtracks of Spike Lee joints before he even started scoring them. In \"Mo' Better Blues,\" Denzel Washington is the trumpet player on screen, but Terence Blanchard is the one playing the notes.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET FEAT. TERENCE BLANCHARD'S \"MO' BETTER BLUES\")\n\nGREIVING: That film was scored by Spike Lee's father, Bill Lee. Blanchard had already played trumpet on Lee's scores for \"School Daze\" and \"Do The Right Thing.\"\n\nTERENCE BLANCHARD: And when we got to \"Mo' Better Blues,\" that's when the film writing part started because he heard me play something on the piano.\n\nSPIKE LEE: And I said, Terence, what is that? He said, oh, it ain't nothing.\n\nGREIVING: Spike Lee.\n\nLEE: I said, no, no, don't give me that; that's something right there; we should make this the theme for Bleek Gilliam played by Denzel Washington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TERENCE BLANCHARD'S \"SING SOWETO\")\n\nGREIVING: Terence Blanchard was already blowing the horn by the time he got to middle school in New Orleans. One of his best friends there was Wynton Marsalis.\n\nWYNTON MARSALIS: We were both playing in the all-district honor band, and we were two of the saddest trumpet players in the band.\n\nGREIVING: It wasn't long before they were two of the best. Besides jazz, Blanchard studied orchestration and composition in high school and college. It didn't surprise Marsalis at all when his friend wound up scoring films.\n\nMARSALIS: He's coming from a tradition of storytellers and narratives in New Orleans, from a Mardi Gras tradition. People - he has a mind for the fantastic.\n\nGREIVING: For Terence Blanchard, storytelling is key.\n\nBLANCHARD: With jazz musicians - the great ones - when you start to improvise, you're trying to tell a story. So you're going to have a beginning, middle and an end to what it is that you do even though you're improvising.\n\nGREIVING: Over the past three decades, parallel to his Grammy-winning jazz career, Blanchard has scored 24 films and documentaries for Spike Lee alone - everything from historical epics like \"Malcolm X\"...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TERENCE BLANCHARD'S \"FRUIT OF ISLAM\")\n\nGREIVING: ...To the HBO documentary about Hurricane Katrina \"When The Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TERENCE BLANCHARD'S \"WADING THROUGH\")\n\nGREIVING: Blanchard is one of the first people to get the script for a new Spike Lee film. And the first thing he does after Lee sends him a rough cut is write themes. He says that, unlike a lot of other contemporary directors, Lee loves a strong, catchy melody.\n\nBLANCHARD: When I first started working with him, he said, man, go watch \"Spartacus,\" you know? And when you watch \"Spartacus,\" that theme comes back a million times. That's his orientation.\n\nGREIVING: For \"BlacKkKlansman,\" Blanchard wrote the main melody primarily for electric guitar.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TERENCE BLANCHARD'S \"RON MEETS FBI AGENT\")\n\nGREIVING: The film is based on the true story of the first black officer for the Colorado Springs Police Department who goes undercover against the Ku Klux Klan. Terence Blanchard says the inspiration for the theme came from Jimi Hendrix's performance of the national anthem at Woodstock.\n\nBLANCHARD: That was incredible to me because, you know, back then, anytime you heard the national anthem, it was always this very pristine, very conservative approach to singing it or performing it. So to hear it done with a distorted electric guitar - it was just radical.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJIMI HENDRIX: (Playing guitar).\n\nBLANCHARD: I just felt like he was screaming to everybody, you know, look, man; we did as much for this country as anybody else; and we should be afforded all the protections and the rights just like anybody else. When I think about Spike's films, the overall gist of what he's dealing with is humanity. And I thought there wouldn't be anything more appropriate than have that sound be a part of the film.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TERENCE BLANCHARD'S \"BLUT UND BODEN (BLOOD AND SOIL)\"\n\nGREIVING: Terence Blanchard and Spike Lee are part of a special class of director-composer duos like Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann or Steven Spielberg and John Williams. It just took the academy decades to recognize their achievements. When I bring up the fact that this is his composer's first nomination, Lee censors himself.\n\nLEE: I'm not going to curse on NPR, but listen to the music - \"Malcolm X,\" \"25th Hour,\" \"Bamboozled,\" \"Inside Man,\" \"Miracle At St. Anna.\" I can go on and on and on and on and on. And now this is the first. Come on now, but we're happy about it (laughter).\n\nGREIVING: Terence Blanchard is happy. If he wins, it'll be the first time a black composer has won best original score in more than 30 years.\n\nBLANCHARD: The thing that I'm excited about the most is that I may be part of a historic moment in the Oscars where there has been a sea change in how things have progressed.\n\nGREIVING: Like the main character in the movie says, maybe one person can make unequal systems better from the inside.

Boxes were still scattered around the apartment, and while her two young daughters played, Nelson scrolled through a newspaper article on her phone. It said religious exemptions for vaccines had jumped nearly 70 percent in recent years in the Greenville area \u2014 the part of the state she had just moved to.\n\nShe remembers yelling to her husband in the other room, \"David, you have to get in here! I can't believe this.\"\n\nUp until that point, Nelson hadn't run into mom friends who didn't vaccinate.\n\n\"It was really eye-opening that this was a big problem,\" she says.\n\nNelson's dad is a doctor; she had her immunizations, and so did her kids. But this news scared her. She knew that infants were vulnerable \u2014 they can't get started on most vaccines until they are 2 months old. And some kids and adults have diseases that make them unable to get vaccines, so they rely on herd immunity.\n\nNelson was thinking about public health a lot back then and was even considering a career switch from banking to public health. She decided she had to do something.\n\n\"I very much believe if you have the ability to advocate, then you have to,\" she says. \"The onus is on us if we want change.\"\n\nLike a lot of moms, Nelson had spent hours online. She knew how easy it is to fall down internet rabbit holes and into a world of fake studies and scary stories.\n\n\"As somebody who just cannot stand wrong things being on the internet,\" Nelson says, \"if I saw something with vaccines, I was very quick to chime in 'That's not true' or 'No, that's not how that works.' ... I usually got banned.\"\n\nNelson started her own group, South Carolina Parents for Vaccines. She began posting scientific articles online. She started responding to private messages from concerned parents with specific questions. She also found that positive reinforcement was important and would roam around the mom groups, sprinkling affirmations.\n\n\"If someone posts, 'My child got their two-months shots today,' \" Nelson says, she'd quickly post a follow-up comment: \"Great job, mom!\"\n\nNelson was inspired by peer-focused groups around the country doing similar work. Groups with national reach like Voices for Vaccines and regional groups like Vax Northwest in Washington state take a similar approach, encouraging parents to get educated and share facts about vaccines with other parents.\n\nNationally, 91 percent of children ages 19 to 35 months old have their vaccination for measles, and rates for other vaccinations range from 82 to 92 percent. But in some communities the rate is much lower. In Clark County, Wash., where a measles outbreak is up to 63 cases, about 76 percent of kindergartners come to school without all their vaccines.\n\nPublic health specialists are raising concerns about the need to improve vaccination rates. But efforts to reach vaccine-hesitant parents often fail. When presented with facts about vaccine safety, parents often remained entrenched in a decision not to vaccinate.\n\nPediatricians could play a role \u2014 and many do \u2014 but they're not compensated to have lengthy discussions with parents, and some of them find it a frustrating task. That has left an opening for alternative approaches, like Nelson's.\n\nNelson thought it would be best to zero in on moms who were still on the fence about vaccines.\n\n\"It's easier to pull a hesitant parent over than it is somebody who is firmly anti-vax,\" Nelson says. She explains that parents who oppose vaccination often feel so strongly about it that they won't engage in a discussion. \"They feel validated by that choice \u2014 it's part of community, it's part of their identity.\"\n\nThe most important thing is timing: People may need information about vaccines before they become parents. A first pregnancy \u2014 when men and women start transitioning into their parental roles \u2014 is often when the issue first crops up. Nelson points to one survey study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that showed 90 percent of expectant women had made up their minds on vaccines by the time they were six months pregnant.\n\n\"They're not going to a pediatrician [yet],\" Nelson says. \"Their OB-GYN is probably not speaking to the pediatric vaccine schedule. ... So where are they going? They're are going online.\"\n\nNelson tries to counter bad information online with facts. But she also understands the value of in-person dialogue. She organized a class at a public library and advertised the event on mom forums. Nelson was nervous that people opposed to vaccines, whom she calls \"anti-vaxxers,\" might show up and cause a scene. She had already been banned from some online forums by vaccine opponents.\n\n\"Are they here to rip me a new one? Or are they here to learn about vaccines?\" Nelson wondered. \"I just decided, if they're here I'm going to give them good information.\"\n\nAmy Morris was pregnant, but she drove an hour and a half to attend the class. Morris wasn't the typical first-time mom Nelson was trying to reach. She already had three kids. But during this pregnancy, she was getting increasingly nervous about vaccines. She had recently had a miscarriage, and it was right around the time she had gotten a flu shot. Morris had been reading pro- and anti-vaccine posts in the mom forums and was starting to have some doubts. In Nelson's class, she learned the risks of not vaccinating.\n\n\"That spoke to me more than anything,\" said Morris.\n\nNow, holding her healthy 8-month-old son, Thorin, on her lap, she says she's glad she went, because she was feeling vulnerable.\n\n\"I always knew it was the right thing to do,\" Morris said. \"I was listening to that fear monster in the back of my head.\"\n\nNelson says that fear is what the anti-vaccine community feeds on. She has learned to ask questions to help parents get at the root of their anxiety.\n\n\"I do think they appreciate it when you meet them sympathetically and you don't just try and blast facts down their throat,\" Nelson said.\n\nNelson is now trying to get local hospitals to integrate that vaccine talk into their birthing classes. She's studying for a master's degree in public health at the University of South Carolina and also works with the Bradshaw Institute for Community Child Health & Advocacy. She's even considering a run for public office.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with WFAE and Kaiser Health News."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/14/694052046/more-2019-short-film-oscar-nominees-reviewed-live-action-and-documentary", "text": "More 2019 Short Film Oscar Nominees, Reviewed: Live-Action And Documentary\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption H264 Distribution H264 Distribution\n\nLive-Action Short Films\n\nIf the theme of this year's animated short Oscar nominees was \"parenthood,\" the theme of 2019's live-action shorts is \"boys in trouble.\"\n\nFrom a son of white supremacists to real-life child murderers, the young men in four out of five of this year's films plunge into a darkness where adults fear not tread. Perhaps they're just upset because their category was the only Shorts award to be cut from this year's live Oscars telecast.\n\nWhat can we learn about ourselves by watching so many loss-of-innocence stories? Let's find out. Here we break down all of the nominees, which may be currently playing as a showcase in a theater near you. Maybe don't bring the kids, though.\n\nDetainment\n\nThe most controversial of the five nominees, Detainment is a fact-based drama about two 10-year-old boys who kidnapped, tortured, and brutally murdered a 2-year-old child in 1993 Liverpool. The \"James Bulger case,\" as it became known, shocked the United Kingdom and resulted in the two killers being tried and convicted as adults. Writer-director Vincent Lambe's drama, based on the real transcripts of the killers' interrogations, is largely set in the police stations where they confessed, focusing on their dawning realization that they have done something truly unforgivable.\n\nBulger's mother has called on Lambe to withdraw Detainment from the Oscars because he did not consult her before making the film, and an online petition demanding the movie be pulled from the nominations has attracted more than 250,000 signatures. One wonders if the many signatories had any objections to British tabloids screaming lurid headlines about the case and its aftermath for decades. Compared with the media coverage, Detainment is restrained and ruminative, with incredible performances from Ely Solan and Leon Hughes as the killers. Rather than portraying remorseless monsters, Solan and Hughes coat their lines in very childlike mixes of denial, outward aggression and uncontrollable sorrow. The result is all the more stomach-churning for its recognizable humanity.\n\nFauve\n\nIn this French-Canadian production, two preteens are playing in an empty pit mine when their oblique power game spins out of control, as such things tend to do without adult supervision. Writer-director J\u00e9r\u00e9my Comte's visually breathtaking enigma is like Gerry for the grade-school set. Callous gray mountains loom in every direction, making it impossible for the kids (played with mischievous gleams by F\u00e9lix Grenier and Alexandre Perreault) to realize once they're in over their heads. Fauve also touches on something deeper: the tendency of boisterous young men to weaponize sympathy to gain the upper hand in some deeper conflict.\n\nMarguerite\n\nThe only nominee in which terrified little boys are neither seen nor heard is also the only one directed by a woman. Marguerite is a quiet domestic drama about a terminally ill woman (B\u00e9atrice Picard) who reflects on a lost love as she bonds with her much younger caretaker (Sandrine Bisson). A smart script by writer-director Marianne Farley subtly considers changing social acceptance between the generations and begins wading into some interesting territory about the limits of geriatric care. If the French-Canadian film is ultimately a bit too timid, it's still welcome to see a matter-of-fact approach to a story that would have been relegated to LGBT-themed festival sidebars only a few short years ago.\n\nMother\n\nDon't forget to breathe when you watch this nail-biter of a thriller from Spanish writer-director Rodrigo Sorogoyen. Set entirely in one Madrid apartment, almost all of it in one take, the film follows a single mother who receives a distressing call from her young son while he is on a beach trip with his father a country away. Tension builds expertly in this tiny space, thanks to a powerhouse performance from Marta Nieto, who ramps up her own distress with every new twist until a few drips have become a burst pipe. Nieto taps into a deep, primal fear of being far away and powerless to help a loved one in danger.\n\nSorogoyen is currently prepping a feature film that builds off the short, which will be welcome news for anyone craving a more pat resolution. But something about Mother's incompleteness \u2014 and the mysterious role of Blanca Apil\u00e1nez as Marta's own visiting mother \u2014 plunges this version deeper into a nightmare space, rendering it that much more difficult to shake off.\n\nSkin\n\nAn American neo-Nazi (Snowfall's Jonathan Tucker) gets his comeuppance in this shock drama that plays like one of those racial allegory sci-fi films from the 1970s and '80s, only without the camp factor. Skin is partially liberated from its own facile twist by the performance of Jackson Robert Scott (It) as the man's young son, who idolizes his father but begins to feel the stirrings of a conscience as the true scope of his violent behavior comes into play. The majority of the short is told from the child's perspective, capturing this contradictory mix of familial affection and extreme hatred for \"the other.\"\n\nAfter he made this short, Israeli writer-director Guy Nattiv premiered a very different feature of the same name, a biopic of reformed white nationalist Bryon Widner, at last year's Toronto International Film Festival. It's tough to discuss the weird sourness of this Skin without spoiling it, but it's telling that Nattiv's first attempt at a story about racism turned on cosmic retribution, while his follow-up focused on the far more difficult and painful task of personal growth.\n\nAndrew Lapin's predictions\n\nWill win: Skin\n\nShould win: Mother\n\nDocumentary Short Films\n\nTwo stories of hate groups and three humanitarian organizations bookend this year's Oscar lineup of best documentary short films. But despite the heavy subject matter and longer average run times, the films in this showcase (now playing in select theaters) are the strongest group of the three Oscar short film categories. Watching them all is an alternately sobering and uplifting experience. Here's our rundown of what awaits nonfiction lovers this year:\n\nBlack Sheep\n\nFilmmaker Cornelius Walker recounts his childhood growing up as the only black kid in the London suburb of Essex in this gripping biography from The Guardian and writer-director Ed Perkins (Garnet's Gold). In a mix of direct-to-camera interviews and chilling re-enactments, Walker describes his strategic decision to survive among violently racist neighbors and classmates by trying to \"fit in\" with them as much as possible. He bleaches his skin; he wears white fashions; he uses contact lenses to give himself those long-sought-after blue eyes. Lacking the means to stand tall against a tide of hate, Walker instead assimilates himself into it. The film's central irony is that Walker's family initially moved out of its multicultural London neighborhood because another young Nigerian immigrant was knifed to death in a stairwell. In trying to protect their son, Walker's parents may have damned him to a terrifying adolescence.\n\nEnd Game\n\nThis Netflix film profiles a hospice and a palliative care center, which are not places where most of us want to spend our time. But End Game is a tremendously moving examination of terminal illness and human mortality, gently urging its audience to confront one of the hardest questions we'll ever have to face: where, how and in what condition we would like to die.\n\nGranted extraordinary access to a handful of patients and their families in their final weeks, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman (Howl) capture every agonizing moment of their subjects' decisions to discontinue medical treatment in an effort to make their remaining time as comfortable as possible. The film is anchored by B.J. Miller, M.D., the gregarious head of the Buddhist-inspired Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco, who asks his patients to \"have some sort of relationship with death.\" Miller's own brush with death as a college student resulted in the loss of three of his limbs, and he speaks movingly about needing to come to terms with his new reality to face his remaining time with distinction. It's a question we all must wrestle with, sooner or later, and End Game makes a strong case for comfort and control over longevity.\n\nLifeboat\n\nIn the choppy, uncertain waters of the Mediterranean, the German nonprofit Sea-Watch conducts rescue missions for the thousands of migrants sailing from North Africa to Europe in overcrowded, poorly constructed vessels. Director Skye Fitzgerald (50 Feet From Syria) tags along to document the humanitarian crisis, profiling several rescued migrants as well as Jon Castle, a longtime captain on Greenpeace sea missions who turns up to aid in the rescues.\n\nLifeboat avoids some of the traps of films like Fire at Sea, another recently nominated documentary on the European migrant crisis, by getting to know both the migrants and the rescuers as people, not just symbols. It's certainly not without its grandstanding, but the film communicates the bleak prospects facing its subjects in cinematic language: for example, a long pan of a Sea-Watch worker slashing and setting fire to an emptied migrant boat to prevent human traffickers from reusing it. Fitzgerald also takes the time to paint a complete picture of the terrible options available to the displaced people, visiting the coast of Libya to show what happens to those who do not risk the journey.\n\nA Night at the Garden\n\nBonds between Americans and Nazis share a much deeper, darker history than what the country saw in Charlottesville, Va., a history that we forget at our own peril. The German-American Bund brought together thousands of Hitler-supporting patriots in the run-up to World War II, most infamously culminating in a 1939 \"pro-America rally\" at a packed Madison Square Garden. Flanked by stars, stripes and swastikas, the Bund's fuehrer, Fritz Kuhn, recited the Pledge of Allegiance, then denounced the \"Jewish-controlled press\" and praised right-wing media demagogues like Father Charles Coughlin. The crowd of proud Americans gave Sieg Heil salutes and cheered like mad.\n\nIn a scant six minutes of archival footage, director Marshall Curry delivers an emotional wallop. We see Kuhn whip his bloodthirsty audience into a frenzy of hate; we see a protester attempt to storm the stage before being restrained by police; we see uniformed Bund children onstage cheering the violence. Never leaving the rally, nor breaking the spell with any talking heads to assure us it's all over now, A Night at the Garden blithely rejects the idea that we have moved on from our shared, horrific past.\n\nPeriod. End of Sentence.\n\nThe invention of a low-cost sanitary pad machine has sparked a women's health revolution in India, which is still fighting an uphill battle to educate both men and women on the topic of menstruation. But most of the media coverage of this phenomenon, including last year's biopic Pad Man, has focused on the machine's male inventor, Arunachalam Muruganantham. By contrast, Period. End of Sentence. profiles the women who work the machine and endeavor to sell the pads in rural villages, seeking to improve not only the national hygiene but also their own independence.\n\nDirector Rayka Zehtabchi hews close to the inspirational-narrative playbook: One of her subjects is an aspiring police officer, so the film dutifully shows her in class and training alongside her male cohorts. She also captures moments that reveal how little her subjects know about feminine hygiene: Schoolboys have no idea what a \"period\" is, while one young woman's uncle thinks the women are making diapers. The Pad Project, the nonprofit backing the film, is working to install pad machines in new markets across the country; this movie should help to further its mission.\n\nAndrew Lapin's predictions\n\nWill win: Lifeboat\n\nShould win: All five nominees are worthy. But if I'm forced to choose, End Game."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/06/682607969/discover-what-the-new-year-holds-with-help-from-tarot-cards", "text": "Discover What The New Year Holds With Help From Tarot Cards\n\nNPR's Leila Fadel speaks with Jessica Dore, a tarot card reader and graduate student in psychotherapy, who gives us an idea of what we can expect in 2019.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nIt's the beginning of a new year. And for many people, that means it's time to set their intentions. So we have Jessica Dore, a psychotherapist and a tarot card reader, here to help us with that. She joins us via Skype.\n\nThanks for talking with us.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this story, Jessica Dore incorrectly refers to herself as a psychotherapist. She practices psychotherapy as part of her master's program in social work but is not licensed.]\n\nJESSICA DORE: Thank you so much for having me.\n\nFADEL: So Jessica, tell us about what you do exactly.\n\nDORE: I'm a psychotherapist. And my interest has been using tarot cards in more of a therapeutic way as opposed to for divination or fortunetelling, which is kind of more traditionally how they've been used.\n\nFADEL: So why tarot cards?\n\nDORE: Well, metaphor is something that is used a lot in psychotherapy. And tarot cards are kind of rich with symbolism and, you know, lots of metaphors that can, I think, help people understand the relationship between thoughts and feelings and behavior, which is, really, what we're trying to do in therapy as well - helping people make those connections.\n\nFADEL: So you chose a card that you felt would be the best to describe 2019. And I have that card in front of me, too. Can you tell us what we're looking at?\n\nDORE: So I chose the six of swords, which is - in the image of the card, you see a person in a boat. And they're moving across a body of water.\n\nFADEL: Right.\n\nDORE: And in the boat, they have six swords that are sort of surrounding them. And in tarot, the swords represent kind of psychological life - so mental events, so, like, thoughts and feelings.\n\nFADEL: Oh.\n\nDORE: And so those swords are sort of representing, you know, some of those more challenging mental events, like anxiety and fear and guilt.\n\nFADEL: Right.\n\nDORE: And this person is moving across this body of water. They're moving toward change, moving toward a new life in a way. And they're bringing those feelings of fear, anxiety or guilt or grief along with them. And so it's this idea that in order to have change, we have to be willing to feel some things that we might not rather - we might rather not feel.\n\nFADEL: You know, there's been a lot of uncertainty and fear and anxiety in the year that we just came out of. And we're starting 2019, at least as a nation, with a lot of uncertainty as well if you look in D.C. And I'm sure that's happening also on the individual level. What do you tell people when they're looking at this sort of sea of uncertainty ahead?\n\nDORE: Yeah. Well, I mean, definitely starting with clarifying values is a huge one. I think a lot of times, people are not super clear on what's important to them. And they don't take the time to sit down and clarify those things, and then it does become more challenging. I also think that social support is super important. And I mean, on one hand, we have a sense of being connected constantly through social media. And that can sometimes be sort of illusory. But on the other hand, social media allows us to connect with people who are going through similar things as we are.\n\nSo for instance, you know, if you are having to have difficult conversations with family members or something like that, like there's, surely, a community online, some other social media forum that can kind of help you and give you some tips for that. I think social support is incredibly important. And knowing that there are other people sharing the experience that you're sharing and offering tips for kind of how to get through it and sharing ideas, I think that's - could be very helpful.\n\nFADEL: Jessica Dore is a psychotherapist and tarot card reader.

The film follows the 2018 campaigns of four female congressional candidates, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nBiographical documentaries have recently grown in popularity, along with budgets and profits. That impresses producer Sheila Nevins, who ran HBO Documentary Films for 36 years and is considered one of the most influential people in the business.\n\n\"It was a real hot year for films making money,\" Nevins says. \"I mean, money, money. Docu \u2014 when I say films, I mean docus \u2014 docus making real money. And docus got very hot.\"\n\nFree Solo, the story of Alex Honnold's climb to the peak of Yosemite National Park's El Capitan without ropes, is still climbing at the box office. So far, it has earned almost $16 million. Box Office Mojo ranks it in the top 20 most profitable documentaries.\n\nThe National Geographic film is a front-runner for the documentary feature Oscar. So is RBG: a portrait of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nRBG has earned $14 million at the box office, putting it in the top 25 highest-earning docs. Directors Julie Cohen and Betsy West, both former TV journalists, see documentaries as a counternarrative to the media world of Twitter and social media.\n\n\"People actually, it turns out, will sit down for an hour and a half and really get engrossed in a true story film,\" Cohen says.\n\n\"We're very excited about that, especially the opportunity to tell stories that really have been ignored over the years,\" West says.\n\nRBG is also nominated for the documentary feature Oscar against Minding the Gap, Hale County This Morning, This Evening and Of Fathers and Sons.\n\nThom Powers is host of the podcast Pure Nonfiction and a programmer for the Toronto International Film Festival. He says we're in \"an undeniable golden age for documentary filmmaking.\"\n\n\"For a long time, there was a bit of a stigma around documentaries that, you know, it was going to be educational, or it was going be a bummer, or it was definitely not going to be a date-night movie,\" Powers says.\n\nPowers says all that has changed, especially with streaming platforms like Netflix and iTunes making documentaries more accessible. He watches as many as 500 documentaries a year and says the popularity has spurred streaming services to fund documentaries like never before.\n\n\"That ability to reach such a large audience is a dream for most filmmakers,\" Powers says. \"However, you know, another big dream for most filmmakers is to see their work on a big screen \u2014 not to be watched on someone's smartphone during a commute.\"\n\nThat dream comes true for director Todd Douglas Miller \u2014 for one week in March, giant-screened IMAX theaters will present his film Apollo 11, a new documentary about the historic 1969 moon landing. NASA gave Miller access to hundreds of reels of never-before-seen 50-year-old footage, some in 70 mm film, plus 11,000 hours of audio from Apollo 11, which was painstakingly synced with the visuals.\n\n\"There's no narration, there's no talking heads, nothing that takes place modern day,\" Miller says. \"It's an all-archival experience.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Neon/CNN Films/Courtesy of Sundance Institute Neon/CNN Films/Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nMiller says he cut different versions of Apollo 11 for different platforms.\n\n\"I would love for everybody to watch this on an IMAX screen,\" he says. \"It's been calibrated that [this] will be the best place to watch it.

It's about the rise and fall of movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex and criminality. The film includes testimonies of his alleged rape victims, such as Paz de la Huerta.\n\nDixon says they hope it will be shown in theaters.\n\n\"If you're sitting in a darkened cinema and you can't go anywhere, you can't look away from the testimony of these women,\" Dixon says. \"And I think that that is a really powerful thing.\"\n\nBut in the end, \"the thing is, you just want a maximum number of people to see it,\" Macfarlane says.\n\nWhile filmmakers and audiences are showing enthusiasm for the cinematic experience, Nevins says this trend could change.\n\n\"I mean, Netflix is all over the place, playing with Monopoly money, buying up everything,\" Nevins says. \"Every network is doing docus.

Tours often visited the museum collection building, with children on tours sitting next to the buckets for a half-hour.\n\nRecently, the park's safety, health and wellness manager, Elston \"Swede\" Stephenson, sent out an email to National Park Service employees and approached the Arizona Republic to warn that people in the building were \"exposed\" to radiation.\n\nWhether that proximity was unsafe has not been determined. Simply being near uranium ore is unlikely to result in an unsafe dose of radiation.\n\n\"Uranium can be harmful to people's health depending on the amount and grade of ore, how people interact with it and the exposure time,\" Jani Ingram, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Northern Arizona University, tells the Associated Press.\n\nBut, she says, \"You can't say, 'Oh my gosh, all those kids are going to develop cancer in five years' because you just don't know how close they were, how long they were there,\" she said. \"But that open bucket was probably the most concerning. It seemed that maybe whoever it was didn't understand what they had.\"\n\nKai Vetter, a nuclear physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, says that the danger from uranium ore exposure strongly depends on the time and distance to the radioactive material.\n\n\"The small risk for measurable health effect does not justify at all leaving the bucket in the public and then just [removing] it,\" he writes in an email to NPR. He says that exposure to large quantities of the radiation emitted from uranium ore can cause cancer. \"The main concern would be to ingest this material, specifically for children.\"\n\nStephenson sent an email to employees on Feb. 4, warning that if they had gone in the museum collections building between 2000 and June 18, 2018, \"you were 'exposed' to uranium by OSHA's definition.\"\n\nHow was the uranium discovered after all that time? In March 2018, the teenage son of a park service employee had a Geiger counter that detected radiation in the collection room, Stephenson said. The buckets had apparently been in a basement for decades before being moved to the museum.\n\nStephenson told the Republic that he immediately contacted a park service specialist to report the uranium ore. A few days later, technicians arrived.\n\nPhotos provided to the newspaper by Stephenson show technicians arriving in June 2018 to take away the buckets of uranium ore. The technicians reportedly dumped the buckets at an old uranium mine 2 miles away, then for some reason brought the buckets back to the building.\n\nStephenson said the park didn't do anything to warn workers or tourists that they had perhaps been exposed to unsafe levels of radiation, despite a Right to Know law that he said requires disclosing the incident.\n\n\"My first interest is the safety of the workers and the people,\" he told the Republic. He is especially concerned about kids who were potentially exposed to radiation, at levels he calculated to be 1,400 times the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's safe level for children.\n\nDennis Wagner, the Republic reporter who broke the story, said that Stephenson approached the newspaper to get the word out to the public after his efforts to get the park service to warn the public went nowhere.\n\nGrand Canyon National Park Public Affairs Officer Emily Davis said that the park service is coordinating an investigation with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\n\"A recent survey of the Grand Canyon National Park's museum collection facility found radiation levels at background levels \u2014 the amount always present in the environment \u2014 and below levels of concern for public health and safety,\" Davis said in a statement to NPR. \"There is no current risk to the public or park employees. The museum collection facility is open and work routines have continued as normal. The NPS takes public and employee safety and the response to allegations seriously. We will share additional information about this matter as the investigation continues.\"\n\nOSHA confirms to NPR that it did open an investigation into the matter on Nov. 28.\n\nThis isn't Stephenson's first time raising alarms about a dangerous working environment, the Republic reports:"}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/19/695877332/kissing-sailor-in-iconic-wwii-photo-dies", "text": "Sailor In Iconic WWII Photo Dies\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Victor Jorgensen/AP Victor Jorgensen/AP\n\nGeorge Mendonsa, the Navy sailor whose passionate kiss in Times Square symbolized a nation's exuberance over the end of World War II, has died. He was 95.\n\nThe photographer never got the name of the sailor, but Mendonsa claimed it was him, and many experts who analyzed his facial structure came to the same conclusion.\n\nMendonsa died Sunday after complications from a fall at an assisted living facility in Rhode Island, his daughter told The Providence Journal. He was two days short of his 96th birthday.\n\nThe iconic photo on the cover of Life magazine was taken by Alfred Eisenstaedt and has become one of the most recognizable photos of the 20th century. The same moment was also captured by a Navy photographer, Victor Jorgensen, and that photo of the kiss (the one above) is often seen in newspapers as well.\n\nAfter Japan declared its surrender in August 1945, impromptu celebrations broke out across the United States. During one of them, Mendonsa and his date were walking through Times Square when he saw the woman, whom he took to be a nurse. The joy of the moment and his admiration for nurses who had treated fellow servicemen compelled him to embrace her, he told the Veterans History Project of the Library of Congress in 2005.\n\nAs a sailor in the Pacific, Mendonsa had been aboard the aircraft carrier USS Bunker Hill when Japanese kamikaze pilots attacked. Men were trapped in the fires of the ship, he said, and others jumped overboard and waited to be picked up.\n\nHours later, Mendonsa's ship transferred the injured to a hospital ship called the USS Bountiful.\n\n\"I was watching how the nurses were taking care of the wounded as we were sending them over,\" he told the Library of Congress. \"And I believe from that day on I had a soft spot for nurses.\"\n\nA few months later, fueled by jubilation and a few drinks, Mendonsa walked up to the woman in Times Square.\n\n\"It was the uniform she had,\" he said. \"If that girl did not have a nurse's uniform on, I honestly believe that I never would have grabbed her.\"\n\nMendonsa didn't say anything to the woman; he just kissed her. \"It happened. She went her way and I went mine.\" Why didn't he ask for her name? \"I was with a date,\" he said.\n\nHis date didn't mind \u2014 in fact, the two went on to marry. Mendonsa didn't get the name of the woman he kissed. But years later, Greta Zimmer Friedman saw the photo and wrote to the editors of Life to say it was her. In 1980, Mendonsa and Friedman were reunited when the magazine brought them together for a photo re-creation.\n\nFriedman, a Holocaust refugee who grew up in Austria, told the Veterans History Project that she was 21 and working as a dental assistant when she became immortalized in the photo.\n\n\"It wasn't a romantic event,\" she said of the surprise kiss. \"It was just an event of 'thank God the war is over' kind of thing. ... It was a day that everyone celebrated because everyone had somebody in the war and they were coming home.\"\n\nFriedman died in 2016."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2018/09/28/651438020/we-had-to-do-it-ourselves-joan-jett-looks-back-on-being-a-conduit-for-women-in-r", "text": "'We Had To Do It Ourselves': Joan Jett Looks Back On Being A Conduit For Women In Rock\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Magnolia Pictures Courtesy of Magnolia Pictures\n\nGrowing up, Joan Marie Larkin had big dreams. She considered becoming an archaeologist or an astronaut, and she wasn't going to let society tell her what a girl could or couldn't do. She eventually turned to music and went on to be one of the most celebrated women in rock: Joan Jett. Bad Reputation, a new documentary out now, traces her hard-fought rise to rock and roll fame.\n\nJett's story starts with a Christmas gift. At 13, she asked her parents specifically for an electric guitar and not an acoustic one. \"I wanted to make those loud noises that I heard on the radio,\" she says. Her parents gave her a Sears Silvertone guitar and she promptly enrolled in guitar lessons. An early guitar teacher inspired her in a way he may not have intended.\n\n\"I said, 'Teach me how to play rock and roll,' \" the musician remembers. \"He said, 'Girls don't play rock and roll.' \"\n\nYouTube\n\nThat response from her teacher only compelled Jett to rock harder. As a teenager, she formed an all-girl band called The Runaways. In the late 1970s, people either didn't know what to think of it or thought some pretty vile things.\n\n\"There were people right from the total, very beginning that were taking shots and being very nasty,\" she says. At some points, Jett had bottles and other heavy objects thrown at her while performing at shows. But Jett recalls that when The Runaways performed abroad in places like Japan, there was a stark contrast in the fanfare of the crowd. In 1977, she remembers, thousands of girls showed up to the band's shows and even rocked cars she was in.\n\n\"Women were looked at, as they are, I guess, around the world, as sort of second-class citizens and so the girls were responding to what they perceived as our power, I suppose,\" Jett says.\n\nThe Runaways officially disbanded in 1979 owing to creative differences, and Jett went into a dark place. \"It felt like defeat,\" she says. \"It was gut-wrenching for me because The Runaways was my baby.\"\n\nShe contemplated leaving music altogether and joining the military. That is, until she met Kenny Laguna, a songwriter and producer. \"She had the look and then I heard her sing,\" Laguna says, recalling the first time he met Jett. \"It was just rock and roll, it was pure rock and roll.\"\n\nOnce she started to work with Laguna, Jett's audience grew. With Laguna's help, Jett formed another band, The Blackhearts, and recorded a debut album which they released independently. The band initially sold records out of the trunks of their cars after concerts.\n\n\"We wanted to be on a major label but we just ... nobody wanted us. So we had to do it ourselves if we wanted to put our record out and we did it,\" Jett says.\n\nEventually, the band was signed, and in 1981, Jett released a second album that included a cover of the Arrows' song \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" which catapulted to the top of the charts. In 1982, the song peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks.\n\nNearly four decades later, Jett's rock legacy has been solidified. Now 60, Jett still performs and says she loves connecting to the audience and watching how deeply the music reaches people.\n\n\"It's difficult to talk about 'cause I feel like I'm giving myself these credits that don't really go to me. It's kind of a universe thing. I'm just a conduit, you know?\" Jett says.\n\n\"A pretty good one,\" Laguna adds.\n\nBad Reputation is out now in theaters, On Demand, on iTunes and on Amazon Prime Video."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2018/06/22/622540331/fact-check-trump-illegal-immigration-and-crime", "text": "FACT CHECK: Trump, Illegal Immigration And Crime\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nUpdated at 8:30 p.m. ET\n\nAfter days of damaging news stories about an administration policy that separated immigrant families at the Southern border, President Trump tried to change the narrative Friday. He spoke up for grieving family members who have lost loved ones at the hands of people in the country illegally.\n\nTrump has frequently pointed to sympathetic crime victims to justify his get-tough policies at the Southern border. But experts say the president's rhetoric overstates the threat posed by immigrants, who tend to commit crime at lower rates than people who are born in the United States.\n\n\"These are the families the media ignores,\" Trump said of crime victims. \"These are the stories that Democrats and people that are weak on immigration, they don't want to discuss, they don't want to hear, they don't want to see, they don't want to talk about.\"\n\nThe president was joined at the White House by more than a dozen parents whose children were killed \u2014 in some cases in traffic accidents \u2014 by immigrants in the country illegally. Their stories offered a counterpoint to those filling newspapers and television broadcasts this week of immigrant children forcibly separated from their parents after crossing the border illegally.\n\nTrump reversed course and ended his family separation policy on Wednesday. But he vowed to continue a crackdown on illegal immigration, defying critics.\n\n\"They don't talk about the death and destruction caused by people who shouldn't be here,\" the president said. \"People that will continuously get into trouble and do bad things.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump often highlighted the case of Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot in San Francisco by Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican national who had repeatedly crossed the border illegally. Garcia Zarate was acquitted of second-degree murder last year. A California jury was apparently convinced by the defense argument that the shooting was accidental.\n\nWhile any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)\n\nAccording to the study, immigrants in the country illegally were also 11.5 percent less likely than native-born Americans to be convicted of sexual assault and 79 percent less likely to be convicted of larceny.\n\nThe study found higher conviction rates among illegal immigrants for gambling, kidnapping, smuggling and vagrancy, but those offenses were rare and made up a tiny fraction of overall crime in Texas in 2015.\n\nA separate March 2018 study in the journal Criminology looked at whether violent crime increases as the number of immigrants living illegally in a community goes up. Researchers found it does not. If anything, the opposite is true: Violent crime appears to fall when more immigrants are living in a community illegally.\n\nTrump disputed those findings during his White House event Friday but he did not offer evidence to the contrary.\n\nIn the aggregate, Trump said, immigrants in the country illegally are responsible for tens of thousands of crimes. He pointed to a 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office that estimated immigrants had committed about 25,000 homicides, 42,000 robberies and nearly 70,000 sex offenses. That estimate was extrapolated from a survey of 1,000 immigrants held in state and federal prisons. But the sample included immigrants living both legally and illegally in the country. It also offered no time frame in which the crimes might have been committed and no basis for comparison with the native-born population.\n\nIn the past, the president has exaggerated threats facing the U.S. to justify his travel ban, tough-on-crime measures and a now-folded commission on voter fraud.\n\nIn an interview with NPR last month, White House chief of staff John Kelly acknowledged that most people crossing the border illegally do not pose a security threat.\n\n\"The vast majority of the people that move illegally into the United States are not bad people,\" Kelly said. \"They're not criminals. They're not MS-13\" gang members.\n\nKelly defended the administration's Southern border crackdown, however, arguing that immigrants coming from rural parts of Central America with little education might not easily assimilate into the United States.\n\n\"We must maintain a Strong Southern Border,\" Trump tweeted Friday. \"We cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief.\"\n\nThe president made similar comments in a meeting with lawmakers earlier this week.\n\n\"We have to be strong on the border,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"Otherwise, you'll have millions of people coming up \u2014 not thousands, like we have now; you'll have millions of people flowing up and just overtaking the country. And we're not letting that happen.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nIllegal immigration at the Southern border dropped off sharply in the early months of the Trump administration. But in recent months, the number of apprehensions has rebounded, driven in part by a growing number of children and families. Overall, the number of illegal border crossers is still lower now than it was in 2014 and a fraction of what it was a decade earlier."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/10/693108978/u-s-and-south-korea-reach-a-deal-on-military-costs", "text": "U.S. And South Korea Reach Deal On Military Costs\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lee Jin-Man/Pool/Getty Images Lee Jin-Man/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe United States and South Korea struck a hurried deal on the cost of the U.S. military presence, papering over a potential vulnerability in an upcoming U.S.-North Korean presidential summit later this month.\n\nUnder the agreement, South Korea will contribute about $890 million a year for the U.S. military presence, an 8.2 percent increase from the previous five-year deal that expired at the end of last year.\n\nThat's less than the billion dollars or more the U.S. had asked for. South Korea was already paying half of the cost of hosting United States Forces Korea, and the U.S. reportedly asked for a 50 percent increase or more.\n\nThe deal still needs to be ratified by South Korean lawmakers before taking effect.\n\nSeoul had sought a three-to-five-year agreement, but only got one, so it will have to return to the negotiating table with the U.S. in a matter of months.\n\nThe Trump administration wants to strike similar deals with other allies who host large U.S. military bases, such as Japan and Germany, but South Korea's resistance could delay that, or make it more difficult.\n\nSome South Korean observers worry that this marks a shift from a \"rules-based international order, to a deal-based order,\" said Chung Kuyoun, a political scientist at Kangwon National University in the city of Chuncheon.\n\nThe U.S. insists that it was not considering pulling any of its 28,500 troops out of South Korea if its financial demands were not met. But it didn't really have to, as South Korean conservatives raised that possibility for them.\n\n\"I regret that President Trump made the unilateral decision to suspend U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises during the first U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore,\" said lawmaker Won Yoo-chul, in an interview in his office at the National Assembly in Seoul. \"I am concerned that he may make a similar decision regarding the USFK in the second summit with North Korea,\" he added, using the initials for the forces in South Korea.\n\nWon, a member of the conservative Liberty Korea Party, represents the city of Pyongtaek, home to Osan Airbase, and Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. military base outside the continental United States.\n\nLegislation passed last year prevents the president from reducing USFK strength below 20,000 troops.\n\nSouth Korea had resisted paying anything over a trillion won, or $890 million. Chung Kuyoun called the figure a \"psychological limitation\" for the South Korean public.\n\n\"Given that the economy is pretty bad, and income inequality is increasing, and average wages is going down,\" she said, \"paying more money for the military forces will become a political cost for the current administration.\"\n\ntoggle caption Lee Jin-Man/Pool/Getty Images\n\nBut ruling Democratic Party lawmaker Song Young-gil says, with the U.S.-North Korea summit looming, and with conservative lawmakers alarmed about a potential U.S. troop drawdown, Seoul was forced to go beyond the 1 trillion won threshold.\n\nSong said Seoul resorted to a plan B, which was the 8.2 percent increase, the same amount as South Korea's increase in its annual defense budget.\n\nSong, who represents the port city of Incheon, argued in an interview that Seoul should be paying the U.S. less rather than more, because U.S. bases in South Korea exist not just for the defense of South Korea, but to protect U.S. global interests.\n\n\"Camp Humphreys not only serves as a defense base against North Korea,\" he said. \"It also serves to contain China and Russia, and to train U.S. forces deployed to the Middle East. So it makes no sense to call us freeloaders.\"\n\nHe admits, though, that USFK contributes to a strategic balance of power in Asia which benefits South Korea.\n\nSong notes that the U.S. has also demanded cash payments for secure communication rooms on U.S. bases, known as Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, in addition to the formal cost-sharing agreement. The U.S. also wants Seoul to pay for the deployment of U.S. strategic assets, such as aircraft carriers and bombers, to the Korean peninsula.\n\nBesides covering logistics and construction costs, South Korea's contribution pays salaries for the roughly 8,700 South Korean employees of the USFK. Ten rounds of negotiations since last March failed to produce an agreement, and the U.S. threatened to furlough the South Korean workers without pay.\n\nBut the employees who staff the U.S. bases could hardly just walk off the job, says Son Gi-o, an official with the trade union representing the workers.\n\n\"If we stop working simply because wages are not paid,\" he said, \"the work of the USFK would be paralyzed, and that could pose a critical threat to national security.\"\n\nAnother union official, Choe Ung-sik, says that the U.S. negotiates Seoul's contribution based in part on the number of Korean employees it needs, but after getting the money from Seoul, the USFK then lays off some of those workers.\n\n\"If the number of laborers declines but their wages remain,\" he asked, \"where does the difference go?\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/17/694466402/interior-dept-s-push-to-limit-public-records-requests-draws-criticism", "text": "Interior Dept.'s Push To Limit Public Records Requests Draws Criticism\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cliff Owen/AP Cliff Owen/AP\n\nWhen Ryan Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, left his post as U.S. Interior Department secretary on Jan. 2, he was under fire on multiple fronts.\n\nThere was an ongoing federal investigation into Zinke's role in a real estate deal between his family foundation and the head of oil giant Halliburton. Rumors swirled that his office tried to replace the head of Interior's internal watchdog with a Trump political appointee. Some of these investigations came about because of public records requests to Interior from media outlets and environmental protection groups.\n\nOne frequent requestor was Western Values Project, a non-profit government watchdog group based in Zinke's hometown of Whitefish, Mont. Zinke called out Western Values specifically, criticizing the group during a Fox News interview shortly before he resigned.\n\n\"They're operatives from the Democratic Party,\" he said. \"They're hacks, they've always been, and they need to be investigated.\"\n\nNow a new rule proposed by Interior in December appears designed to make it harder for groups like Western Values Project to get those public records. The rule would give the agency greater discretion over how it handles public records requests. For instance, the agency would require individuals or organizations to be more specific in which documents they want. It also allows a cap on the number of documents Interior processes for individuals and organizations every month.\n\nWe file public records requests in order to find out if the people who run the Department of the Interior have conflicts of interests with the companies that they are supposed to regulate.\n\nNone of which sits well with Chris Saeger, the Western Values Project's executive director.\n\n\"What they are doing is a very thinly veiled effort to target critics of the Trump administration and to keep their corruption a secret,\" he said.\n\nWestern Values is a vocal and persistent critic of the Trump administration. It has filed 152 requests with the Interior Secretary's office since Trump took office. The agency's embrace of industry as part of its pro-energy agenda has, in part, led to a two hundred percent increase in Freedom of Information Act requests to the secretary's office from all kinds of groups and individuals.\n\n\"We file public records requests in order to find out if the people who run the Department of the Interior have conflicts of interests with the companies that they are supposed to regulate,\" he said.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut the Interior Department argues it's being inundated by complex requests from \"litigious special interest groups\" asking for thousands of government emails and documents.\n\n\"They are more voluminous,\" said Hubbel Relat, counselor to Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt. \"They've delved a little deeper into the quest for a range of information that appears to, at times, be asking for every document that's ever been created by the Department of the Interior.\"\n\nIf the requests aren't responded to within 20 workdays or processed within a timely manner, the Interior Department can be sued. Western Values has filed six lawsuits against Interior in the past two years; at the end of fiscal year 2018, the Interior Department was facing nearly 130 FOIA-related lawsuits.\n\nRelat said all this litigation has slowed down the processing of public records requests for everyone else, including those who can't afford to litigate and must wait even longer for a response.\n\n\"What this [new rule] does is allow us to say, 'OK. We will produce a set number of documents and then we are going to move to the next requester and then and on and on,\" Relat said. \"So everyone gets the same amount of documents and we will return to your request once everybody has had a turn.\"\n\nBut media advocates aren't buying it.\n\n\"The changes are really incredible,\" said Adam Marshall, a staff attorney with the Reporters Committee For Freedom of the Press. \"And not in a good way.\"\n\nHis organization has filed comments with Interior on behalf of 39 news organizations \u2013 including NPR. It argues the regulations will make it more difficult for the public and the press to know what's going on at Interior.\n\n\"These are things that affect people in a really tangible way,\" Marshall said. \"Increased public interest should be welcomed by the department. They should be taking steps to make more information available.\"\n\nMarshall argues that the Interior Department should hire more staff to process requests in a timely manner.

One of the places prioritized for construction is the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, where the majority of illegal crossings now occur. Residents there have strong views about the barrier, both pro and con.\n\nNayda Alvarez is a lifelong resident of La Rosita, a small town along the Rio Grande nested between the cities of Roma and Rio Grande City. She's a local high school speech teacher and lives next door to her parents.\n\nShe remembers the moment she opened a letter from the federal government. \"You know, I've had like a stress headache ever since I've got that letter,\" she said.\n\nThe letter asked Alvarez if she would grant the federal government permission to survey her land for the possible construction of some kind of border infrastructure.\n\nShe doesn't know what her legal options are: \"It's the uncertainty behind the letter or behind everything, because you ask questions and they don't know when or where or how or what's going to happen.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Veronica G. Cardenas/Texas Public Radio Veronica G. Cardenas/Texas Public Radio\n\nSurveying is generally the first step before the federal government offers to purchase the land. If the landowner doesn't want to sell, the federal government can sue, using its power of eminent domain to take the land.\n\nThe first letter arrived in Alvarez's mailbox in September. Then a second one came in November, and a final one, threatening legal action, followed in January.\n\nAlvarez has not yet responded to any of the letters because she's busy seeking legal advice.\n\n\"I have lived here all my life,\" she said. \"This land belonged to my great-grandparents since this area was part of Mexico. Unlike some people [who] say that we might be first generation \u2014 no, my parents and great-grandparents have been here forever.\"\n\nThis is about what is right or wrong, and a wall is not going to help anything. It's not gonna work.\n\nAlvarez questions the need for an emergency declaration to build a wall in her backyard \u2014 she says she has felt safe in her community her entire life. She says she has tried to talk to local, state, and federal government officials, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, about the impending border project.\n\n\"You ask them questions, and they have no idea,\" she said, referring to her interactions with the Army Corps of Engineers. \"They won't give you an answer. They just give you the runaround, and they never give you a straight answer.\"\n\nBut now Alvarez thinks she has a plan to get elected officials' attention.\n\n\"If they ever do a flyby, I do have my 'No Border Wall' up on my roof so they know where I stand, but nobody's bothered to ask us,\" said Alvarez. \"This is about what is right or wrong, and a wall is not going to help anything. It's not gonna work.\"\n\nGracie Garcia lives in Los Indios, a small town by the Rio Grande near San Benito in Cameron County. She knows what it's like to see a border wall built on her property. That happened to her over a decade ago.\n\n\"It's 10 years since they built it, and to this day we haven't been paid for anything as we were told they were supposedly going to pay for the property, the amount of land they took,\" said Garcia.\n\nGarcia is also a lifelong Rio Grande Valley native and lives with her four children next to a section of border wall that cuts through her backyard.\n\n\"When I look at the wall, I think it's just a waste of money,\" said Garcia. \"I really don't understand why they went this way.\"\n\nGarcia said she stayed in the area even after the wall went up because she loves her community.\n\nLet's try this wall, because for 75 years, nothing has worked. Maybe this will.\n\n\"It's really peaceful. Everyone gets along with everybody, the neighbors,\" she said. \"It's quiet and it's good. It's a really good place to live in. It's comfortable.\"\n\nBut Ruperto Escobar, who lives by the Rio Grande in the small town of Escobares near Roma in Starr County, about 90 miles away from Garcia, welcomes the push for more border barriers. He said he has seen people cross illegally onto his property from Mexico.\n\n\"I've seen how freely people walk through here,\" said Escobar. \"That's a fact.\"\n\nEscobar, 75, is a farmer who owns a total of about 600 acres of land. He doesn't mind the government cutting through his property, because he believes it will reduce the flow of drugs coming into the United States. The topic is extremely personal to him.\n\n\"It has affected some of my kids, and I have personally gone through the hell that parents go through when they have children that are addicted to any one of these drugs,\" said Escobar. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs coming into the U.S. from Mexico arrive through legal ports of entry along the Southern border.\n\nStill, Escobar is inviting the government to build a wall on his property: \"I say, let's try to stop it. Let's try something new. Let's try this wall, because for 75 years, nothing has worked. Maybe this will.\"\n\nNayda Alvarez said she doesn't have the luxury of a 600-acre farm.\n\n\"I'm not losing a piece of my land. I'm actually going to lose my house,\" said Alvarez. \"Unlike other people who say, 'Oh, I'm just going to lose the back part' \u2014 OK, you lose your back part, but I'm going to lose my house. What are we supposed to do? This is not America. Or at least not the America that I know.\"\n\nIt's still unclear how many miles of border wall will be built in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nAccording to the border security bill passed by Congress and signed by the president, the Department of Homeland Security and the local elected officials of the cities affected by the upcoming border wall will need to reach an agreement regarding the design and alignment of physical barriers by Sept. 30."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/15/695184555/americans-who-were-detained-after-speaking-spanish-in-montana-sue-u-s-border-pat", "text": "Americans Who Were Detained After Speaking Spanish In Montana Sue U.S. Border Agency\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brooke Swaney/ACLU of Montana via AP Brooke Swaney/ACLU of Montana via AP\n\nTwo women who were detained and asked to show identification after speaking Spanish in a convenience store in Montana are suing U.S. Customs and Border Protection, saying the CBP agent violated their constitutional rights when he detained them and asked to see their identification.\n\nAna Suda and Martha \"Mimi\" Hernandez \u2014 American citizens who were born in Texas and California, respectively \u2014 were questioned as they attempted to buy groceries in Havre, Mont., last May. They captured video of the encounter, which began inside the Town Pump gas station and convenience store. In all, they were detained for some 40 minutes.\n\nIn the footage, CBP Agent Paul O'Neal is seen telling one of the women, \"Ma'am, the reason I asked you for your ID is because I came in here and I saw that you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here.\"\n\nWhen it was posted last spring, the video raised new questions about the Trump administration's methods for carrying out a crackdown on people who have entered the U.S. illegally from the Southern border. Suda and Hernandez say the agent had no cause to detain them; they accuse the CBP of violating their rights against unreasonable seizure and equal protection under the law.\n\nSuda and Hernandez filed suit with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, along with its chapter in Montana and a local law firm.\n\nThe lawsuit asks a federal district court to order the CBP not to stop or detain anyone \"on the basis of race, accent and/or speaking Spanish,\" unless those characteristics are tied to a specific and reliable suspect description. They also want the court to declare that someone's race or language isn't enough on its own to create suspicion to justify a seizure or detention. The suit also seeks unspecified compensation and punitive damages.\n\nThe two friends have lived in Havre for several years, working as certified nurse assistants at a local medical center and raising their children, according to their lawsuit. They say they had left work, gone to the gym and were waiting to pay for their milk and eggs when Hernandez said hello to O'Neal in the checkout line \u2014 and that he replied by saying she had a strong accent.\n\nHe then asked the pair where they had been born \u2014 leading Suda to ask, \"Are you serious?\"\n\n\"Dead serious,\" O'Neal responded, according to the suit.\n\nSuda told the agent she had been born in El Paso, Texas; Hernandez said she was born in El Centro, Calif. But that didn't satisfy O'Neal, who \"demanded that the two provide him with identification and refused to let them pay for their groceries\" until they complied, the suit states.\n\nO'Neal then took the women outside by his CBP jeep. At that point, the women started using their phones to film what was happening. As they did that, O'Neal radioed in their names and dates of birth.\n\nYouTube\n\nWhen one of the women asked whether they were being detained \"because of our profiles,\" O'Neal replied, \"No, it has nothing to do with that. It's the fact that it has to do with you guys speaking Spanish in the store, in a state where it's predominantly English-speaking, OK?\"\n\nThe women say they were detained for a total of around 40 minutes \u2014 spending much of it standing by the CBP car.\n\n\"So it is illegal to speak Spanish in Montana?\" Suda asked O'Neal.\n\n\"Well, ma'am it's not illegal, it's just very unheard of up here,\" the agent said.\n\n\"The United States has no official language,\" the suit states, adding, \"Many United States citizens, and many non-citizens who are in this country lawfully, are not fluent in English.\"\n\nAfter O'Neal's supervisor arrived at the scene, Suda asked whether they would have been detained if they had been speaking French in the store. For reference, Havre is only about 20 miles from the U.S.-Canada border.\n\n\"No, we don't do that,\" the supervisor replied, according to the court document.\n\nSuda and Hernandez's lawsuit describes the experience as one of humiliation that has inflicted emotional and psychological harm \u2014 and has stoked fears of speaking Spanish in public.\n\nAlex Rate, one of the women's lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, tells member station MTPR that the plaintiffs have felt repercussions both from the incident and their decision to go public.\n\n\"This is a small town and so there have been confrontations around town amongst other people,\" Rate said, according to MTPR. \"There have been issues at Ana and Mimi's (Martha's) place of employment. So it's just fair to say that folks know that this is out there, and they don't like the fact that Ana and Mimi are standing up for their rights.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Suda and Hernandez had narrowly missed being detained earlier in 2018, when a CBP agent who saw them dancing one night took photos of them that he shared with other agents, along with a message: \"There are two Mexicans at the bar.\"\n\nThe incident might have resulted in the pair being detained, the suit says, if another agent hadn't replied that he recognized the women \u2014 and that they were friends with his wife.\n\nContrary to the CBP agent's statement that Spanish isn't spoken often in Havre, the lawsuit states that a local radio station broadcasts in the language and that despite having a population of fewer than 10,000 people, the town is home to \"a strong and vibrant Latinx community.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/15/695135985/behind-the-border-crisis-more-migrant-families-risk-dangerous-remote-crossings", "text": "Behind The Border 'Crisis': More Migrant Families Risk Dangerous Remote Crossings\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joel Rose/NPR Joel Rose/NPR\n\nIn a desolate stretch of desert outside Yuma, Ariz., there's a spot where more than 350 migrants, including children, burrowed under the steel border fence a few weeks ago.\n\n\"This only goes down just about probably another foot, this steel,\" said Anthony Porvaznik, chief patrol agent for the Yuma sector of the Border Patrol. He says smugglers tried digging in more than a dozen spots, looking for places where the ground was soft enough.\n\n\"This is very sandy,\" Porvaznik said. \"It's like that all the way down, and so it was easy to dig.\"\n\nAbout once a week, Border Patrol agents come across migrant groups of 100 people or more in some of the most isolated parts of the Southwest border. In Arizona, the number of migrant families and children crossing the border more than doubled last year, straining resources in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe White House says the situation is evidence of a broader crisis at the Southern border. On Friday, President Trump declared a national emergency to free up billions of dollars to expand the border wall. The administration wants a total of about $8 billion, including the $1.4 billion in the funding bill passed by Congress, for border wall construction.\n\nBut immigrant advocates say U.S. officials have exacerbated the situation at the border by limiting the number of migrants who can seek asylum at legal ports of entry. They say that's pushing a growing number of migrant families to cross illegally in more remote areas of Arizona and New Mexico, miles from the nearest food, water and medical care.\n\n\"We hesitate to use the word 'crisis,' because we don't think that this is a threat to the country,\" said Joanna Williams of the Kino Border Initiative, a humanitarian group that operates a migrant shelter in Nogales, Mexico.\n\nThe vast majority of these migrants are fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. And Williams says U.S. immigration officials have underestimated their desperation to reach U.S. soil.\n\n\"They're trying to find a route to safety,\" Williams said. \"For them, the risks are worth it.\"\n\nNo longer the 'wild, wild west'\n\nDespite the recent influx of migrant families, the Yuma sector is widely considered a border enforcement success story.\n\nThe number of illegal border crossings in Yuma today is just a fraction of what it used to be in the early 2000s. Former acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke touted the sector's turnaround in a 2017 op-ed in USA Today titled \"Border Walls Work. Yuma Sector Proves It.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joel Rose/NPR Joel Rose/NPR\n\nEven as Border Patrol agents \"were arresting on average 800 illegal aliens a day,\" Duke wrote, \"we were still unable to stop the thousands of trucks filled with drugs and humans that quickly crossed a vanishing point and dispersed into communities all across the country.\"\n\n\"It was just to me like the wild, wild west. It was just out of control,\" said Barbie Moorhouse, a helicopter pilot in the Border Patrol.\n\nBefore she was a pilot, Moorhouse worked on the ground as a Border Patrol agent in the mid-2000s. Back then, she says, agents ran themselves ragged chasing migrants who were trying to cross illegally.\n\n\"We did the best we could with what we had at the time,\" Moorhouse said. \"But it is definitely a better situation today than it was 10 years ago. The change was pretty dramatic.\"\n\nSince then, the Border Patrol's ranks have swelled. More miles of wall and fence have been built. And the number of illegal border crossings is far below what they used to be.\n\nBut today, the face of those migrants has changed. Instead of farmworkers and laborers trying to dodge agents, nearly 90 percent of the border-crossers are families and children. Instead of trying to get away, they're trying to get caught.\n\nAnd once again, the U.S. is not prepared.\n\n\"It is a crisis for us because this is a situation that the Border Patrol is not resourced or geared to deal with,\" said chief patrol agent Anthony Porvaznik.\n\nBorder Patrol agents are spending hours caring for the migrants in their custody, Porvaznik said. They pick up hundreds of hamburgers at a time from McDonald's and wait with migrants at the hospital if they need medical attention.\n\nWe need additional manpower to deal with the population that we have to essentially babysit.\n\n\"We need additional manpower to deal with the population that we have to essentially babysit,\" Porvaznik said. \"And that takes Border Patrol agents away from a national security border security mission to deal with a humanitarian mission.\"\n\nPorvaznik says big groups of migrants have been especially frustrating, because they take his agents away from the law enforcement tasks they signed up for when the joined the Border Patrol.\n\n\"We're here to arrest people that are trying to do bad things and bad people trying to come into the country,\" Porvaznik said. \"And we still do that. But when we have this priority mission of having to deal with children and families, that takes away from our ability to get manpower out where we need them.\"\n\nUnlike the border-crossers of a decade ago, many of these Central American migrants are trying to turn themselves in to the Border Patrol to request asylum in the United States.\n\n\"There's not an incentive to travel in smaller groups or to try to hide from immigration officials,\" said the Kino Border Initiative's Williams. So these migrants are crossing in larger groups because \"in many ways, it's safer,\" she said.\n\nA few years ago, it was more common for migrant families to cross in places like the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. But Williams says that route has become increasingly dangerous because the Mexican side of the border is controlled by cartels. So migrants are crossing in remote borderlands, in spite of the risks.\n\nIn December, an 8-year-old girl died in U.S. custody after crossing with a large group of migrants in a remote corner of New Mexico. Her death, as well as that of a second migrant child a few weeks later, prompted the Border Patrol to expand medical screenings for all migrants in its custody.\n\nThere's another reason these migrant families have gotten more desperate, says Williams. In the past, they might have gone to legal ports of entry to request asylum. But since last year, U.S. officials have been letting only a few families in at a time at many ports of entry.\n\nSo these migrants have to choose between two bad options if they want to reach the United States: They can cross the border illegally in remote areas, or they can wait, sometimes for months, in border towns.\n\nStrained resources in Mexico\n\nIn the town of San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, right across the border from Yuma County, Ariz., hundreds of migrant families sleep out under blue tarps \u2014 the same kind you'd see emergency responders hand out after a hurricane.\n\nA few feet away, two clogged lanes of traffic also wait to get into the United States. Occasionally the drivers roll down their windows to give money to the migrants or buy them snacks from street vendors.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joel Rose/NPR Joel Rose/NPR\n\nThe migrants themselves keep track of everybody's place in line in a simple spiral notebook. On this day, the notebook is in the hands of a Guatemalan asylum-seeker named Herbert Leal. He flips through the pages to show me the names of more than 100 families from southern Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador. Leal says they're waiting because they want to do this the \"right\" way.\n\n\"To show U.S. authorities that we are able to wait,\" he said through an interpreter. \"That we respect the laws of Mexico, and we respect the laws of the United States. That is why we're here.\"\n\nThese migrants are afraid to leave this spot because they might lose their place in the line to request asylum. But some do venture to a migrant shelter in town called Casa del Migrante la Divina Providencia.\n\n\"This house was made originally for men,\" explained Martin Salgado, who runs the shelter. Salgado's mother helped found the shelter in the 1990s. Back then, Salgado says, it was primarily a way station for migrant men trying to get to the U.S. to work.\n\nBut now Salgado says the majority of migrants are women and children seeking asylum.\n\n\"From a year ago, there's a lot of women,\" Salgado told me. \"In the past, you didn't see this picture.\"\n\nBefore, this was a place to bunk for a night or two. Now many of its beds are empty. But Salgado says the shelter has found other ways to serve the migrants. They come during the day to eat, to shower and to wash their clothes before returning to the line.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joel Rose/NPR Joel Rose/NPR\n\n\"These are good people. In my own village, I could not imagine anyone being as helpful and giving,\" said Rosia Ramirez Penaloza, a migrant who left Guerrero, in southern Mexico, with her three children. Her youngest daughter is 10 months old. She has another daughter who is 9 and a son who is 11. Ramirez says a gang member in their hometown tried to recruit him.\n\n\"They would tell him that if he doesn't join them, they are going to hurt us,\" she said in Spanish through an interpreter. \"Hurt his little sister and us.\"\n\nRamirez and her children spend their nights sleeping under a blue tarp fastened directly to the metal border wall, along with hundreds of other migrant families, waiting for their number to be called.\n\nA growing shelter in Tucson\n\nBack across the border in Tucson, Ariz., a shelter for migrant families and children called Casa Alitas has had to grow quickly to keep pace with the growing number of migrants.\n\n\"We started back in 2014 in Tucson at the bus station,\" says Diego Javier Pina Lopez, the lead coordinator for the shelter. Casa Alitas moved into a house, which it quickly outgrew, and then two houses.\n\nA few weeks ago, the shelter relocated again, to its biggest quarters yet: a former Benedictine monastery in Tucson. The owner, a local real estate developer, is planning to build apartments on the property but is letting migrants stay there until construction begins.\n\n\"We essentially got the keys on a Wednesday,\" Pina Lopez said, \"and then we were told we needed to open on that Saturday.\"\n\nMost migrant families stay at the shelter for less than 24 hours.\n\nThey truly believe that their lives are at risk and, even worse, the lives of their children are at risk.\n\nThey're dropped off by immigration officials after they're released from custody, typically with a notice to appear in immigration court. The shelter offers them a place to shower, eat and sleep. Volunteers provide medical screenings and flu shots and help the migrants book their bus tickets to join friends and relatives across the country.\n\nOne room in the sprawling 1940s monastery is full of donated toys. In another, piles of coats, jackets, backpacks and shoes are free for the taking.\n\nThe staff members at Casa Alitas say it's unlikely that more miles of border wall will deter these migrant families from coming to the United States.\n\n\"They truly believe that their lives are at risk and, even worse, the lives of their children are at risk,\" said Teresa Cavendish, director of operations for Catholic Community Services of Southern Arizona, which runs the shelter.\n\n\"I think it will actually cause more suffering to have the walls in place,\" Cavendish said, \"because folks will simply go to further extremes in order to make it here.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/15/695062771/journalists-arrest-in-philippines-sparks-demonstrations-fears-of-wider-crackdown", "text": "Journalist's Arrest In Philippines Sparks Demonstrations, Fears Of Wider Crackdown\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 11:50 a.m. ET\n\nPress freedom advocates across Manila, Philippines, including students and some faculty at a handful of universities, have been rallying the past two days following the arrest of journalist Maria Ressa this week.\n\nThe award-winning journalist and outspoken critic of President Rodrigo Duterte's administration was arrested Wednesday on charges stemming from coverage by her online news website, Rappler, one of the Philippines' few independent news outlets.\n\nSpeaking with NPR, Ressa says that the media cannot be silent, because the rule of law is the \"only thing that keeps a democracy together.\"\n\n\"Press freedom is not just about journalists. Press freedom is the foundation of all the rights of all Filipinos for the truth,\" she says. \"We're in a battle for truth, and the first causality of the truth is the number of people killed in the drug war. This is death by a thousand cuts of Philippines' democracy.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRessa, a former CNN bureau chief, is a co-founder and the CEO of Rappler. She was served the warrant at her office and was charged with one count of cyberlibel, stemming from a story initially published seven years ago. Ressa spent the night at the headquarters of the National Bureau of Investigation and was released on bail the next day.\n\nOutside the NBI building after her release, Ressa told reporters that her arrest was about two things: abuse of power and weaponization of the law.\n\n\"This isn't just about me, and it's not just about Rappler,\" she said. \"The message that the government is sending is very clear. ... Be silent, or you're next. ... I am appealing to you not to be silent ... especially if you're next.\"\n\nThis was the sixth time that Ressa has posted bail in the past few months, but it was the first time she'd been formally arrested. Ressa was honored last year along with other prominent journalists as one of Time magazine's People of the Year. She and her news site have been a thorn in the side of Duterte since he took office in 2016, critically reporting on his administration and its deadly war on drugs.\n\nDuterte's government has repeatedly tried to take Ressa and Rappler to court on charges ranging from alleged tax evasion to being \"fully owned by Americans.\"\n\nThe latest cyberlibel charge against Ressa stems from a complaint by a local businessman, Wilfredo Keng, who says he was defamed by a Rappler article first published seven years ago and then republished two years later, according to NPR's Julie McCarthy.\n\nIn the article, Keng is linked to murder, human trafficking and drug smuggling. According to The Associated Press, Rappler claims to have used information cited in a 2002 intelligence report, but the news agency did not specify from which government agency the report originated.\n\nRessa's lawyers want the case thrown out, calling it politically motivated. The Philippines' Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 was passed in September of that year. The story in question was first published in May 2012. The case against Ressa rests on the fact that the law was updated in February 2014 and the article about the allegedly defamed businessman was updated that same year.\n\nOne of Ressa's lawyers, JJ Disini, told CNN that the update was \"merely a punctuation change.\"\n\n\"If the libel had been committed way back in 2012, a change in punctuation couldn't have republished that libel,\" Disini added.\n\nRessa is expected to be arraigned on March 1, Rappler reporter Aika Rey tells NPR.\n\nConcern over wider crackdown\n\nRessa's arrest is widely seen by both domestic and international media watchdog and human rights groups as a broadening of the Duterte administration's crackdown on press freedoms in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines called Ressa's arrest \"clearly manipulated\" and part of the \"administration's obsession to shut Rappler down and intimidate the rest of the independent Philippine media.\"\n\nButch Olano, Amnesty International's sector director in the Philippines, called the charges \"trumped up\" and called for Philippine authorities to end the harassment.\n\n\"In a country where justice takes years to obtain, we see the charges against [Ressa] being railroaded and the law being used to relentlessly intimidate and harass journalists for doing their jobs as truth-tellers,\" Olano said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. State Department spoke out in support of the arrested journalist.\n\n\"We hope these charges will be resolved quickly, in a way that fully respects the freedom of the press, allows Ms. Ressa and Rappler to continue to operate freely, and is consistent with the Philippines' tradition of a free and independent press,\" a spokesman said, according to the news wires.\n\nDuterte says he had nothing to do with Ressa's arrest. He also said he didn't even know the businessman who brought the case against her.\n\nRappler is not the only news organization Duterte has gone after, reports McCarthy. He has also threatened to pull the licenses of other mainstream outlets in the Philippines this year, she says."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/12/693814827/a-neuroscientist-explores-the-biology-of-addiction-in-never-enough", "text": "A Neuroscientist Explores The Biology Of Addiction In 'Never Enough'\n\nEnlarge this image Image Source/Getty Images Image Source/Getty Images\n\nGrowing up, neuroscientist Judith Grisel would take little sips of alcohol at family events, but it wasn't until she was 13 that she experienced being drunk for the first time.

How?\n\nOn how drug and alcohol abuse affects the brains of young people\n\nThe changes in behavior that happen during adolescence are so important and lasting because the brain is forming permanent structures. So whatever you experience as an adolescent is going to have a much more impactful influence on the rest of your life trajectory than it would, say, if you did this at another time in development when your brain wasn't so prone to changing.\n\nWhen the circuits are being laid down, if they're laid down under the influence of a drug, then they're going to be laid down differently than if it's not under the influence of a drug. If you start using at 28, when the circuits are already more or less set, then you're not going to have such a long-lasting impact. ...\n\nProbably [the brain is] not mature until about 25, and this is a really critical time. We see definitely lasting changes on the brain and behavior. So binge drinking certainly predisposes toward alcoholism. It also alters the circuits, the connections, between nerve cells and the pathways, including the dopamine pathway. It's not just drinking early or how much you drink, but the pattern that you drink \u2014 and binge drinking is probably the worst pattern if you want to predispose toward problem use.\n\nOn how alcohol is like a pharmacological sledgehammer\n\nAlcohol is such a mess. It's a tiny, tiny molecule, and it acts all over the brain in so many different pathways. It affects endorphins, as I said, and dopamine. It affects glutamate and GABA, the two primary excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. It affects all kinds of ion channels. It's so small that it can act all over the place. And so it's been really hard to study. In fact, we still are just beginning to understand how it is that you feel drunk \u2014 what the mechanisms are for feeling drunk \u2014 because it acts kind of like a sledgehammer or just in a widespread way to disrupt all kinds of cell functioning.\n\nOn how cocaine is like a laser\n\nCocaine is the perfect opposite of alcohol in this way. It does one thing. It does it really effectively. It blocks the recycling of dopamine and other neurotransmitters like ... norepinephrine, and that enhances pleasure and enhances arousal and enhances movement. So it's very specific. It's easy to study, relatively, I should say, and much easier to understand how it works.\n\nOn how marijuana floods the brain\n\nMarijuana is both like cocaine and like alcohol. So it's like cocaine in that its actions are very specific, and it's like alcohol in that those actions are all over the brain. ... It does one thing, but it does it everywhere. So for cocaine, it does one thing, but it does it in just a few pathways. Alcohol does many things all over the place. THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, does one thing more or less, but everywhere, and that thing is to enhance communication between cells, to enhance the message. So to kind of turn up the gain or the volume on a particular message that neurons are communicating. ...\n\nWhen we smoke marijuana, the whole brain is flooded with THC, and that causes the cell-to-cell communication in cells throughout the brain to be enhanced or to be exaggerated. And that's really fun, because it seems like, \"Wow, everything is so interesting! Everything is beautiful! The music is so rich! The colors are so wonderful! The food is delicious!\" Everything at once is turned on. That's not how the natural system would work with discretion. ...\n\nWhat's unfortunate is the brain does adapt to that, and it adapts by decreasing the number of sites that THC can have an effect [on]. So those sites down-regulate, meaning they go away over time, and it doesn't take long, but ... the more you use and the more often you use, the less of those receptors there will be. ... When you take away the drug, then things seem sort of lifeless and gray and maybe less interesting.\n\nOn opiate addiction\n\nOpiates make a user feel like they are not suffering, that they are completely content, completely comfortable, completely well, that everything is OK the way it is. And I think that for that reason they're so attractive, because often we don't experience that things are OK the way they are. So they are kind of a perfect antidote to suffering of any kind.\n\nThe problem is [that] if we reduce suffering and we produce euphoria using opiates, the brain adapts. And so now we don't feel high and completely content with them; we just feel not sick and miserable. And when we take them away, we feel full of suffering \u2014 much more suffering than we had started with to begin with. So the brain produces its own type of suffering.\n\nOn why she does not believe methadone is a good solution to opiate dependency\n\nMethadone is a pure substitute addiction, so it takes the place of other opiates. It's easier for society because it's very long-lasting, so people aren't going through this really intense period of withdrawal. ... It's cheap and it lasts a long time, and it makes the user not withdraw.\n\nSo for the rest of us, it's kind of a nice thing because these people who are opiate dependent are kind of out of the way; they're not so hard to deal with. But for those users \u2014 especially if they're young \u2014 it's even harder to get off of methadone than it is to get off of, say, heroin, because it lasts such a long time.\n\nOn how drug and alcohol use is so ingrained in society\n\nIt's just something to notice how much of society is focused ... on kind of buffering or escaping or mitigating reality in some way. And for people who can get away with that without self-destructing, I think that's something still to notice. But for the rest of us [who struggle with addiction] \u2014 and we're not really that rare \u2014 it's a pretty common disorder. ...\n\nI do think we really, as a society, cannot get enough. It's everywhere. I also think, though, that it's important to ask individually, I guess, \"Is this drug use enhancing my life, or is it diminishing it?\" So for coffee I can say, happily, it's enhancing my life and the costs of a little tolerance and dependence are not so bad, because I can just drink three cups. But I think that is something that we have to go into our own hearts to know the answer to.\n\nSam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited the audio of this interview.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced this afternoon on the Senate floor that the president will sign into law the border deal reached by Congress this week. But that's not all.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL: He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time. And I've indicated to him that I'm going to support the national emergency declaration.\n\nKELLY: That declaration could allow the president to build even more border wall without consent from Congress. Democrats won't let it happen without a fight. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis joins us now.\n\nHey there, Sue.\n\nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hi.\n\nKELLY: All right, so the national emergency declaration - what exactly is it? How does the president plan to use it?\n\nDAVIS: The White House has been signaling for weeks that this is something that they would consider doing. So the news of it isn't necessarily a surprise. In fact, a lot of his supporters on Capitol Hill were encouraging him to do it no matter what. Presidents in general have pretty broad authority to declare national emergencies to marshal federal resources when needed. It happened - it has happened a lot. But the key here is generally when they do it, there is no dispute that the nation is in a state of emergency. Think President Bush after Hurricane Katrina. Doing this in a way that essentially is a play to redirect taxpayer dollars to build a border wall - it's a pretty provocative political act, and it might be an unconstitutional one.\n\nKELLY: To the politics of this, I said Democrats are not going to let this happen without a fight. What can they do to try to block it?\n\nDAVIS: They have a legislative option. Under the law that gives the president this authority, it also gives Congress the same legal authority to overturn a national emergency. Practically speaking, they'd need a veto-proof majority, and they're probably not going to get that with Republicans in control of the Senate. They also have legal options. They can challenge him in the court. You know, Congress has the constitutional authority, the power of the purse to declare how money is spent. If the - and they equally have been preparing for this. Democrats knew they could do it. In the State of the Union response - or one of them - California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that he would be one of the attorney generals (ph) who will file suit if the president did this. We should be looking for that next.\n\nKELLY: To inject some history here - for eight years under President Obama, Republicans were complaining about executive overreach. They accused the president of trying to make an end run around Congress. They accused him of violating the Constitution. How are Republicans like Mitch McConnell, who's the one who announced this - how are they OK with this?\n\nDAVIS: McConnell announcing his support is fascinating in part because we know from our own reporting that he has privately been very concerned about the president doing this. It may not also have unified support among Republicans up here. There is significant concern that setting a precedent where a president can invoke a national emergency when he loses a policy fight with Congress - it's a pretty dangerous precedent to set if it's not your guy in the White House or a woman in the White House, I should say. Speaker Pelosi spoke to that today.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nNANCY PELOSI: Republicans should have some dismay about the door that they are opening, the threshold they are crossing.\n\nDAVIS: This is the kind of presidential decision that could have the potential for any number of new precedents and unintended consequences if he's ultimately successful.\n\nKELLY: And Sue, not to lose sight of what we thought was going to be the big news tonight - the border security deal and whether the president would sign it - he waged the longest shutdown fight in history because he wanted this $5.7 billion to build a wall. In the end, he says he's going to sign this deal. What does it get him of what he wanted?\n\nDAVIS: The bill will include nearly - or about 1.4 billion for border wall funding that will fund 55 miles of new barriers. It's quite possible he may use the emergency declaration to try to make up for what he didn't get. We're looking for details on that from the White House.\n\nKELLY: NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis, thank you very much.\n\nDAVIS: You're welcome.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In a previous version of this report, we incorrectly said that President Barack Obama declared a national emergency after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

But it is only the beginning of McCabe's revelations about the relationship between the nation's leading law enforcement agency and the 45th president.\n\nThe tension in that relationship is palpable even in the title of McCabe's memoir, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump. The publication date is Feb. 19, but the most explosive assertions burst into the news Thursday when CBS aired portions of its upcoming interview with McCabe (set to air Sunday on 60 Minutes).\n\nThat interview includes specific statements from McCabe regarding the 25th Amendment discussions and confirmation that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein once speculated about \"wearing a wire\" to record a conversation with Trump without the president's knowledge.\n\nThose specific statements from 60 Minutes do not appear in the memoir but have become the flashpoint for coverage of the book this week. And they fit with the extensive and detailed descriptions that McCabe does provide of the crisis atmosphere in the FBI and the larger Justice Department following Comey's firing.\n\nMcCabe says that he personally took steps to \"safeguard\" the bureau's investigation of Russian interference, just in case his own head would be the next to roll. He tells of working closely in those first post-Comey days with Rosenstein, who subsequently named Robert Mueller to take over the Russia probe as head of an office of special counsel. (Mueller is himself a former FBI director who had been a colleague of Comey and McCabe.)\n\nThe Threat How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump by Andrew G. McCabe Hardcover, 274 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nMcCabe has said that Rosenstein in 2017 spoke of \"wearing a wire\" when meeting with the president, meaning a microphone transmitter that could record statements that might matter to a future investigation or other legal proceeding. (It should be lost on no student of history that President Nixon was brought down by tape recordings made of Oval Office conversations pertaining to the crimes collectively called Watergate.)\n\nMcCabe also said in TV interview clips aired on Thursday that Justice Department officials discussed which Cabinet officials might be sympathetic to removing the president, using the authority of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. (That amendment, ratified in 1967, deals with presidential succession and the prospect of presidential incapacity, creating a means for the vice president and others to step in if the president were deemed unfit to serve.)\n\nRosenstein denied this version of the events of mid-May 2017 when they were first reported in the New York Times in September 2018. That Times story relied on unnamed sources. One source who spoke to the Times anonymously said he thought Rosenstein might have been sarcastic in making the remark about wearing a wire.\n\nRosenstein said on the record in September 2018 that he had no such recollection, and his office issued a reiteration of that statement Thursday. McCabe is the first person associated with those conversations to confirm publicly the account as reported in the Times.\n\nBut his book is about far more than that, as he remained at the FBI for another 10 months after Comey's departure and was in frequent conflict with the president. Having announced he would retire from the bureau in March 2018, McCabe was fired the day before he became eligible for full retirement benefits. The official reason for his firing was cited as \"lack of candor.\"\n\nAn FBI inspector general report had disputed McCabe's answers to four questions having to do with Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, although it isn't clear yet whether authorities will ultimately bring criminal charges against him.\n\nTrump reacted to McCabe's book and comments in a series of tweets Thursday, saying McCabe had been part of a plot with Comey to exonerate Hillary Clinton for her handling of State Department business on a private email server. (Trump had earlier said he fired Comey over the Clinton email matter, although he also mentioned \"the Russia thing\" in an interview with Lester Holt of NBC News in 2017.)\n\nTrump's tweets added fuel to what was already a firestorm of reaction to McCabe's on-the-record account on Thursday. Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would bring McCabe before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, to explain himself. Other allies of the president were similarly dismissive.\n\nBut reading through McCabe's 262-page memoir suggests McCabe's critics may wish to proceed with caution. Any attempt to make him a pariah or impugn his integrity will need to deal with his extraordinary degree of preparation for what is about to come his way.\n\nLet us take a step back. When a book that is about to be published suddenly becomes the source and subject of a major news story about the president of the U.S., it has two effects on the fortunes of that book \u2014 one promotional and one perverse.\n\nThe first is obvious. Having every print, broadcast and cable news operation suddenly featuring a first-time author and his story drives advance sales heavenward. But the perverse effect may be the more lasting. The nugget of news becomes the focus of all attention paid to the author and the work, usually to the detriment of both.\n\nWe are seeing both effects here. All those who had forgotten McCabe over the past year or who had avoided hearing of him in the first place will now know he has a book that \"everyone\" is talking about. But getting people to read past the initial punch to the presidential nose may be daunting \u2014 for fans and detractors alike.\n\nMcCabe begins his story with his love for the FBI, and he introduces himself by imagining what his own FD-302 would look like. The code refers to an official report on his own application to join the bureau in 1995, and he has to imagine it because the actual report is kept in FBI files and, he says, is unavailable to him.\n\nThis \"just the facts, ma'am\" approach harkens back to the FBI lionized in movies and on TV. It also gives us a bare-bones outline of McCabe the man, who seems a model of rectitude despite such vulnerabilities as two possession-of-alcohol citations he received as an underage undergraduate at Duke University. (We are also told he \"experimented with marijuana\" but no other drugs.)\n\nLater, after a chapter regarding his abrupt elevation to acting FBI director, McCabe returns to the chronology familiar to readers of memoirs \u2014 walking us through the relevant experiences of his early career with the bureau. Having a law degree and having worked as a lawyer, he finds himself investigating Russian organized crime figures in the 1990s. Later he recounts how the bureau's focus shifted after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and how its resources were reallocated to that threat.\n\nBut we have had more than a few books on these subjects, and McCabe eventually returns to the threat he clearly wants to alert the nation to now. He is also ready to defend himself against efforts to discredit his work at the FBI, including the suggestion that he conspired to harm the Trump campaign as a Democratic operative.\n\nTrump has made much of McCabe being married to a woman who ran for the state legislature in Virginia in 2015 as a Democrat. Jill McCabe's campaign received a contribution from Terry McAuliffe, who was then the state's Democratic governor. McAuliffe is a longtime friend and associate of Bill and Hillary Clinton. McCabe tells us he himself has been \"a registered Republican\" his entire adult life.\n\nMcCabe would surely have uncomfortable moments in a hearing into his performance in office and his handling of all relevant parts of the Russia probe. But such a hearing before a Senate committee with a massive TV audience watching might also be uncomfortable for others involved.\n\nMcCabe's portrait of the Trump administration and of the president himself is as alarming as any we have seen so far \u2014 including those of journalists such as Bob Woodward and former staff such as Cliff Sims. Trump appears as an insecure bully who rules by instilling and enforcing fear. McCabe calls Trump \"a deliberate liar who will say whatever he pleases to get whatever he wants.\"\n\nIf McCabe is to be allowed to repeat even a slice of it all before the bright lights of a televised Senate hearing, he will reach an even wider audience than publishing a book \u2014 or even 60 Minutes \u2014 could ever provide."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/14/694620105/airbus-to-stop-production-of-a380-superjumbo-jet", "text": "Airbus To Stop Production Of A380 Superjumbo Jet\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tony Avelar/AP Images for Emirates Tony Avelar/AP Images for Emirates\n\nEuropean aerospace behemoth Airbus has announced it will stop building its A380 superjumbo jet after the plane's biggest customer, Dubai-based Emirates Airline, cut its order by 39 planes.\n\nAirbus has \"no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years,\" CEO Tom Enders said in a statement Thursday, adding: \"Today's announcement is painful.\" Airbus says it will deliver its final A380 to Emirates in 2021.\n\nAfter investing billions into the A380, Europe's largest aerospace company had hoped to overtake its biggest competitor, Boeing's 747 jet. Airbus had once positioned itself as a luxury airplane with enough amenities to rival the seven wonders of the world, which it proclaimed in one commercial ad. Some carriers included showers, lounges and duty-free shops as well as bars on both decks of the A380s.\n\nAfter a stronger-than-expected start, Airbus struggled to sell the $446 million plane that can seat more than 800 passengers \u2014 the largest and most expensive commercial passenger aircraft ever made, and the first to have two full decks. Most airlines preferred smaller aircraft that were more economical to operate.\n\nWhile saying it is sad to see the end of production of the double-decker A380 jetliner, The Associated Press reported, \"the long-haul carrier Emirates has struck a deal valued at $21.4 billion with Airbus.\"\n\nThe A380 \"will remain a pillar of our fleet well into the 2030s,\" Chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in a statement. But in reducing its order, Emirates has opted instead for some of Airbus' smaller offerings. Emirates followed Australia's Qantas, which canceled plans last week to buy eight of the planes, and Virgin Atlantic, which canceled its order in 2018.\n\nAirbus predicted at launch that it would sell 1,200 of the superjumbo jets, CNN reports. Instead, it has sold 234. No U.S. passenger airline ever ordered one. While Emirates mostly flies long-haul international flights through its central hub in Dubai \u2014 and therefore needs a plane that can carry lots of passengers long distances \u2014 the trend today is toward offering more direct flights using smaller aircraft, Business Insider has explained.\n\nDespite news of the company's decision to close its flagship A380 program, on Thursday, Airbus announced stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results, with revenues up 11 percent to over 23 billion euros, according to Reuters."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/12/691999347/soul-searching-after-parkland-dicks-ceo-embraces-tougher-stance-on-guns", "text": "Soul-Searching After Parkland, Dick's CEO Embraces Tougher Stance On Guns\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Dalton/Invision for DICK'S Sporting Goods/AP Images Scott Dalton/Invision for DICK'S Sporting Goods/AP Images\n\nAlmost nine months after the Parkland shooting, Ed Stack \u2014 the CEO of Dick's Sporting Goods \u2014 stood up in the audience of a New York Times conference. He got up to talk about restricting gun sales at his stores. He had done it many times before, but this time, he got personal.\n\n\"I'm not embarrassed to say I'm viewed as a relatively tough guy,\" Stack said. \"I wouldn't characterize myself as a crier. And that weekend, I watched those kids, and I watched those parents, and I hadn't cried as much since my mother passed away.\"\n\nHis highly publicized tougher stance on gun sales and outspoken push for reform turned the now-64-year-old into an unlikely corporate face of gun control. To Wall Street, the company's new gun policy wasn't out of line with its business interests. But to most Americans, this was a staid, dependable athletics store suddenly plunging into activism.\n\nOne year after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, Stack's early lobbying efforts have proved difficult. But on a corporate level, the company remains steadfast in its new gun sales policy. Dick's no longer sells the type of semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting, which is sometimes called assault-style or military-style. Dick's also no longer sells any firearms to people under 21.\n\nThis situation has been remarkable for several reasons. Dick's is the biggest sporting goods retailer in the country and has a subsidiary dedicated to hunting and fishing, called Field & Stream. Stack himself is a gun owner and was a longtime Republican donor. And Dick's is based in a Pittsburgh suburb \u2014 in Western Pennsylvania, where the gun rights debate is heated.\n\n\"Dick's Sporting Goods had a personal connection to Parkland and they were the first to take action of a lot of businesses that then followed suit: Walmart, the banks, insurance companies, credit card companies. Made a big difference in the NRA,\" said Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the Parkland shooting and who says he personally knows one of Dick's executives.\n\nAround Pittsburgh, where the memory of the mass shooting at a local synagogue in October is still raw, opinions on Dick's post-Parkland gun policies vary.\n\nIn the city itself and its liberal suburbs, people said they were proud of Dick's taking a tougher stand on guns. At Dick's stores around the city, most shoppers said the gun policy has not affected them or changed their shopping habits. Beyond the city, gun owners said they felt betrayed.\n\n\"I'll never shop there again. They'll never get another dime from me,\" said Jody Salerno, standing behind the counter of her gun store and shooting range, called Elite Firearms & Training, outside Pittsburgh. William DeForte, an instructor at her range, nodded.\n\n\"With it being a homegrown company, it was more of a slap in the face to Western PA. Our roots are pretty deep with the Second Amendment,\" Salerno said, as DeForte picked up her thought: \"The gun-owning community, hunting, defense, all the shooting sports,\" he said. \"They pissed off their core firearm customer base.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alina Selyukh/NPR Alina Selyukh/NPR\n\nRash decision?\n\nThe most common take on the new policy at Dick's \u2014 even among its supporters \u2014 is that the company had a knee-jerk reaction to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Seventeen people were killed, and an unprecedented wave of youth activism followed.\n\nAnd indeed, the Parkland shooting was a game-changer for Stack.\n\nDick's executives ran the shooter's name through the internal systems and found that months earlier, the retailer had sold him a gun \u2014 while following all the laws. It was a different kind and wasn't used in the shooting. Still, in interviews that followed, Stack would point out how the sale illustrated a broken system, which he wanted lawmakers to fix.\n\nInside Dick's, this position had been percolating for some time.\n\nAfter the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, Dick's stopped selling assault-style rifles. The company dealt with a backlash from the gun-owning community. Later, the rifles were back on sale only at the Field & Stream stores.\n\nDick's as a company is not known to go out on a limb. Take its headquarters, which is next to the airport for efficiency \u2014 instead of some snazzy downtown office. Its dress code did not officially allow jeans at work until 2017.\n\nAnd people who know Stack will say he does not make rash calls.\n\n\"Every decision he makes in the company I think is very calculated, and he's made good decisions,\" said Jim Roddey, former chief executive of Pennsylvania's Allegheny County, home to Dick's Sporting Goods.\n\nRoddey also used to chair the county's Republican Party, which in 2011 wanted Stack to run for the Senate. \"We thought he would be a great candidate,\" Roddey said. \"His story is wonderful. Here's the young son that took over and built this empire.\"\n\nStack's father \u2014 the eponymous Dick Stack \u2014 had started the company in 1948 almost on a dare, as a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton, N.Y. When his health declined, son Ed and Ed's siblings took over. Ed Stack opened the headquarters near Pittsburgh, took the company public in 2002. Including subsidiaries, Dick's now has more than 800 stores.\n\n\"That business is his religion,\" was how Roddey put it.\n\nAnd so historically, Stack's political and corporate work aligned. When Dick's Sporting Goods would lobby Congress, it was usually about tax policy.\n\n\"He believed in lower taxes, certainly in lower business taxes. He believed in personal responsibility, individual freedoms, the Second Amendment,\" Roddey said.\n\nIn all his interviews last year, Stack always mentioned his support of the Second Amendment. According to his company, he still owns guns and is a registered independent. Stack declined NPR's interview request.\n\nLobbying effort\n\nAfter Parkland, Stack began calling on Congress to write new laws that would echo Dick's corporate policy: Ban assault-style firearms and raise the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21, among other things.\n\nThe key part of Stack's media campaign after Parkland was an open letter \"imploring\" lawmakers to act. Later, in an op-ed video for The Washington Post, he declared: \"I suspect that many of our legislators know what's right. It's kind of a clich\u00e9, but leaders lead. They make difficult decisions.\"\n\nIn April, Dick's hired a lobbying firm in Washington to advocate for gun control, a move that conservative media critics chewed over.\n\nBut recent records show the company spent somewhere between $0 and $5,000 on the effort \u2014 barely anything by lobbying standards. The lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association, for example, spends millions of dollars every year.\n\nFaced with gridlock and politicking ahead of midterm elections, Dick's Sporting Goods retreated from Capitol Hill.\n\n\"In the second half of 2018, Mr. Stack felt that no progress was made coming out of his meetings in Washington, D.C., as each member of Congress talked straight across party lines,\" a company spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nInstead, Stack decided to speak about gun laws and his company's restrictions at events, like that New York Times conference.\n\n\"We don't know for sure, we actually think that saved some lives,\" he said standing in the audience. \"And if we had a mulligan to do it all over again, we'd do it all over again.\"\n\nThe fallout\n\nWhat's been the financial fallout for Dick's so far?\n\nIn November, the company reported a 3.9 percent dip in sales, dragged down particularly by hunting goods. Wall Street expects a similar trend to show up in Dick's full-year results due in March.\n\nAt the same time, the company's profit margin improved slightly. That's because guns and ammunition \"tend to be very, very low margin,\" said Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia. Dick's makes more money from selling most other items in its stores, like sports equipment or clothing.\n\nAnd that's why Wall Street has been far less stirred by the Dick's story than the media, Svezia said.\n\nFor example, Walmart caused far less outcry when it stopped selling modern sporting rifles in 2015. The retailer simply said it was a business decision because those weapons weren't selling well. Last year, Walmart said it will also stop selling guns and ammo to anyone under 21 \u2014 right after Dick's made the same announcement.\n\nAnd hunting has been a drag for Dick's for a long time. Fewer people hunt these days. Gun sales overall are in a decline because of what's known as the \"Trump slump\": The constant fear of a gun-ownership crackdown drove sales during the Obama years but has dissipated under President Trump.\n\nIn 10 stores, Dick's is actually running a test, removing virtually all hunting gear entirely.\n\nIn December, Stack disclosed that 62 employees had quit Dick's in response to the change in its gun policy. At least two of the resignations had gone viral on social media. One of them was by Griffin McCullar, who at the time was 20 and worked at Dick's in North Carolina.\n\n\"I honestly liked it a good bit, even up until the day I left,\" he said. \"I got to talk to people about hunting and fishing every day.\" Both are his huge interests. So are guns and the Second Amendment. He says he worked a full day after the policy changed.\n\n\"My problem was I had 18-, 19-, 20-year-old Marines \u2014 I mean, we were right next to a Marine Corps base,\" McCullar said. \"The U.S. government is handing them various different extremely high-caliber firearms. And I can't hand him a 12-gauge shotgun off the shelf to check out? That's where I had a huge disagreement.\"\n\nMcCullar said more of his co-workers agreed with him but couldn't quit as easily as he did. He also stopped shopping at Dick's, though he said he has plenty of friends who still do.\n\nStack actually mentioned McCullar's story in December as he disclosed the 62 resignations. He said he respected the man's handling of the situation \u2014 stating his disagreement with the policy without bad-mouthing the company \u2014 and would hire him back anytime.\n\n\"It's OK to have differing views,\" Stack said, speaking at a Wall Street Journal event. \"We just have to respect each other and have a civil conversation.\"\n\nMcCullar said he wouldn't go back unless Dick's reversed its policy. \"But it was kind of funny to me that [Stack] actually mentioned me in a good way,\" McCullar said. \"I kind of can respect that a little bit.\"\n\nNPR's Tim Mak and Business Desk intern Janhvi Bhojwani contributed to this story."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/14/691963430/greeting-cards-are-still-a-thing-in-the-digital-age-thanks-millennials", "text": "Greeting Cards Are Still A Thing In The Digital Age. Thanks, Millennials\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Colin Gray/Getty Images Colin Gray/Getty Images\n\nThis Valentine's Day, the greeting card industry is healthier than you'd expect.\n\nWhile email, texts and social media companies from Facebook to Snapchat have made it easier than ever to send instant greetings, more people \u2014 especially younger people \u2014 are sending greeting cards.\n\nOver the past year, greeting card revenue has been steady. The greeting card industry could bring in as much as $933 million this Valentine's Day, up a bit from last year's estimated $894 million, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nGreeting card experts say it's younger people and millennials, in particular, who have been keeping the industry afloat. And they're buying fancier specialty cards, often with personal touches.\n\n\"For Valentine's Day, I got my mother a pop-up card that had a little cartoon that jumped out like it would give you a hug with a speech bubble that said, 'I love you,' \" said Ben Leeper, 22, of Leawood, Kan. Valentine's Day is the second biggest holiday of the year for greeting cards.\n\nBut millennials are also buying cards for birthdays, for anniversaries and even to congratulate friends on taking medical school exams. These are the kind of \"cardworthy\" events that the Greeting Card Association has noticed are popular among millennials, said its vice president, George White, who is president of Up With Paper, an independent stationery company in Mason, Ohio.\n\nBut some people just like sending greeting cards. Leeper sends a lot of thank-you notes as well as \"just because\" cards to friends nearly every week. He buys them when he goes grocery shopping.\n\nThere's very little overall current data for the greeting card industry. Most in the industry tout this 2012 report that 6.5 billion cards are bought each year. But the industry had been struggling for years, especially as social media and e-greeting cards took off, Greeting Card Association officials said.\n\nIn 2013, the No. 2 company in the industry, American Greetings, had been struggling so much that the firm, which was formerly publicly traded, went private. And over the past decade, the number of letters and cards sent by U.S. mail has fallen consistently each year.\n\nHowever, a recent report on the greeting card industry by AnythingResearch shows 3 percent growth in revenue last year (although the same report forecasts declines in years to come).\n\nNew trends in greeting cards\n\nMillennials are also embracing newer digital greeting card apps that allow people to send personalized cards with a click of a button. Mobile apps Felt and Postable both allow users to upload a picture from their phone and write a personalized message in their own handwriting. And then the companies mail the greeting card to the recipient.\n\nYoung people are also shopping for greeting cards from some of the big photo-printing companies, such as Shutterfly and Vistaprint, that let people upload personal pictures to customize stationery and greeting cards.\n\nAnd then there are the millennials who are getting in on the greeting card industry. More young people are starting their own companies that make new kinds of cards that feature pop-up 3D images, hand-painted artwork, LED lights, sounds and even animated cartoons that can be accessed with a mobile phone.\n\nTheir goal is to create a more personalized experience and make cards that are more relatable to younger people.\n\nVictoria Venturi is the creator of Paper Epiphanies in Portland, Ore. Her cards feature messages such as \"Grateful AF\" and \"I think we're related somehow, Merry Christmas!\"\n\n\"When I started the company, I thought there was a real lack in the industry of cards that spoke with the words that I use with my friends and my peers,\" she said.\n\ntoggle caption Barrie Lazarus/Just My Type Greetings\n\nBarrie Lazarus just launched a greeting card company that sells cards with folding paper layers that reveal different messages or witty jokes.\n\n\"I've loved greeting cards since I was a child. I never throw them out if I receive one,\" she said. Lazarus wants young people to appreciate the value of physical cards. \"I want to make America greet again,\" she added.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Janhvi Bhojwani/NPR Janhvi Bhojwani/NPR\n\nBut these cards are more expensive. And so millennials are buying fewer greeting cards as a whole compared with other generations. Basically, they're not buying boxes of cards to send to 50 friends around the holidays. Instead, they're spending more on each fancier, higher-quality card.\n\nTake Yoomie Huynh, who just last week spent nearly $8 for a pop-up card featuring a fancy car to congratulate a friend who is getting married.\n\n\"I like giving cards because you can hold it, unlike a text or email,\" said Huynh, 38, of Takoma Park, Md.\n\nBut the higher prices are not going unnoticed. Twitter is full of enraged greeting card customers.\n\nBut some greeting card lovers are just fine with the price. Brittany Williams, 23, of Fort Washington, Md., was browsing a Papyrus stationery store in downtown Washington, D.C., the day before Valentine's Day.\n\n\"I spend $10 at the most on a card,\" she said. \"I really like the funny ones and the ones with voices.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/13/694192304/a-better-funded-movement-is-growing-to-counter-the-nra", "text": "A Better-Funded Movement Is Growing To Counter The NRA\n\nIn the year since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the NRA's influence is changing. And, the groups political spending is down.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThe year since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., has led to a less favorable political landscape for the National Rifle Association. Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, and many ran on platforms contrary to the NRA. For the first time now, a growing and better-funded movement now exists to counter the gun rights group. NPR's Tim Mak has more on the NRA's changing influence.\n\nTIM MAK, BYLINE: After his daughter's death in Parkland, Fla. - one year ago tomorrow - Fred Guttenberg sat in his house grieving.\n\nFRED GUTTENBERG: To me, I thought the first thing I need to do is to remove the grip of the gun lobby. And I walked around my house kind of, like, in a daze, saying to anybody who will listen, we're going to go after their money.\n\nMAK: Parkland motivated people like him to get active in politics, joining a growing movement led by Everytown For Gun Safety, an adversary to the NRA founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. This is the first sustained, well-funded opposition that the NRA has ever faced. And the gun rights group acknowledges this. Here's a spokesperson for the NRA's lobbying arm, Jennifer Baker.\n\nJENNIFER BAKER: What has changed is that for the first time the gun control groups are well-funded and have efforts nationwide. They have an infinite amount of resources as they are funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who is decidedly anti-gun. And so he has allowed these organizations to have a presence in the state capitals on lobbying and to really put forth an effort we've never seen.\n\nMAK: For decades, the National Rifle Association has been a driving political force. Its large grassroots membership alone gives its positions heavy weight. In an interview with NPR, their spokesperson put its membership between 5 and 6 million.\n\nBAKER: We have more dues-paying members than any other grassroots organization in the world.\n\nMAK: But last week, the House Judiciary Committee held the first hearing on gun violence in eight years, a reflection of the new Democratic House majority. And today, that same committee is marking up legislation expanding background checks for firearm sales, something polls suggest most Americans support. The bill's supporters argue that the legislation's consideration alone indicates a changing national conversation about gun issues.\n\nJOHN FEINBLATT: It was considered the third rail of American politics.\n\nMAK: That's John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown For Gun Safety.\n\nFEINBLATT: That was true for Democrats, it was true for Republicans - no more.\n\nMAK: And the NRA is mired in a Senate investigation into whether it worked with Russia to influence American politics in 2016. Feinblatt also points out that the NRA spent less money in the 2018 midterms than in previous midterms.\n\nFEINBLATT: The NRA staged a disappearing act. They were really nowhere to be seen compared to previous years.\n\nMAK: The NRA counters that all of these supposed changes are just hype, that polling on background checks overstates its support, that their lower fundraising is a reflection of how their supporters feel less threatened with Trump as president. And the NRA does not believe that new gun restrictions will go anywhere because of allies in the Republican-controlled Senate. And they also point to a Supreme Court where they believe they have a majority on gun rights issues.\n\nBAKER: Practically speaking, the landscape has not changed for the prospect of enacting federal gun control. In the Senate, they don't have the 60 votes that they need, and there is a pro-Second Amendment president in the White House. But what has changed is that we now have a majority of Supreme Court justices who are originalists.\n\nMAK: And Richard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist, agrees and says that not only will gun legislation not pass into law but that the push from Democrats will also energize NRA supporters.\n\nRICHARD FELDMAN: That's what gets them activated. That's what gets them motivated. That's what gets them to send much higher contributions to the very groups that are dedicated to protect that issue.\n\nMAK: One year after the Parkland shooting, the political realities are changing, but the National Rifle Association remains a force to be reckoned with.

Now, an explosive follow-up: Church leaders have failed in many cases to investigate the abuse claims and even allowed known offenders to move from congregation to congregation.\n\nIn reports published Tuesday, the Houston Chronicle and the San Antonio Express-News identified 35 Southern Baptist pastors, youth ministers and volunteers who were convicted of sex crimes or accused of sexual misconduct but were able to continue working in churches, with access to children and youth. In some cases, that led to repeated incidents of abuse in different church communities.\n\nThe newspaper reports have shaken the Southern Baptist world and prompted church leaders to promise reforms comparable to some now contemplated by Roman Catholic authorities.\n\n\"There can simply be no ambiguity about the church's responsibility to protect the abused and be a safe place for the vulnerable,\" wrote J.D. Greear, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, in a blog post Monday.\n\nAs happened in response to reports of abuse by Catholic clergy, victim advocates say that SBC leaders can no longer be trusted to investigate abuse allegations on their own.\n\n\"A child who comes forward and makes a disclosure against somebody in a leadership position almost doesn't stand a chance,\" says Boz Tchividjian, a former sex crimes prosecutor who now directs GRACE, an organization devoted to fighting child sex abuse in Christian circles. \"The [church] power structure will circle the wagons around the one who's been accused, because they're seen as a representative of God. And how dare you destroy the career of God's representative?\"\n\nTchividjian, a grandson of evangelist Billy Graham, says any evidence of abuse by a church worker should be investigated by criminal authorities rather than church officials.\n\nAlbert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, argued in an essay published on his website that an independent third-party investigation is \"the only credible avenue\" for any church organization faced with a sex abuse allegation.\n\n\"No Christian body, church, or denomination can investigate itself on these terms,\" Mohler wrote, \"because such an investigation requires a high level of thoroughness and trustworthiness. Only a third-party investigator can provide that kind of objective analysis.\"\n\nAccording to the Texas newspaper reports, the Southern Baptist Convention has rejected efforts to establish a sex offender registry that local church authorities could consult to avoid hiring known predators.\n\nOne complicating factor is that Southern Baptist churches, unlike Catholic parishes, operate autonomously. Individual congregations are able to ordain and hire pastors on their own, and SBC authorities are powerless to force their churches to join efforts to track sex abusers from community to community.\n\nThe one power SBC authorities have stems from the SBC principle that a local Southern Baptist church must be \"in friendly cooperation\" with \"the causes\" of the convention. In the past, that principle led SBC authorities to break ties with those Southern Baptist congregations that declined to condemn homosexual activity.\n\nIn his website essay, Mohler suggested that similar action could be taken against any Southern Baptist church \"that would willingly and knowingly harbor sexual abuse and sexual abusers.\"\n\nIn response to earlier reports of abuse in Southern Baptist congregations, the denomination's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission convened a \"Sexual Abuse Presidential Study Group.\"\n\n\"True, we have no bishops. But we have a priesthood of believers,\" wrote ERLC President Russell Moore in a post responding to the latest allegations. One of the study group's missions, Moore said, is \"training churches to recognize sexual predation and deal with charges or suspicions when they emerge.\"\n\nSuch measures may not be sufficient for some victims of abusive church leaders, however.\n\nLori Anne Thompson, a survivor of sexual abuse both at home and in her church, has since avoided churches altogether, even though she still considers herself a devout Christian.\n\n\"When you are abused in a faith-based environment, that becomes a trigger,\" she says. \"When a cleric sexualizes sacred things, they no longer nourish in the way they once did. They don't mean what they used to mean.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/12/693824163/trump-supporter-violently-shoves-bbc-cameraman-at-el-paso-rally", "text": "Trump Supporter Violently Shoves BBC Cameraman At Rally In El Paso, Texas\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Leah Millis/Reuters Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nUpdated at 4:43 p.m. ET\n\nA man in a red Make America Great Again cap violently shoved a BBC cameraman and shouted profanities during President Trump's rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night, in a startling moment that briefly interrupted the president's speech.\n\nThe BBC's Ron Skeans was working in the area of a raised camera platform at Trump's campaign event when, he says, a \"very hard shove\" came out of nowhere. At the time, Trump was touting recent economic numbers to a roaring crowd in the El Paso County Coliseum.\n\nSkeans' colleagues say the apparent attack came after repeated verbal assaults on the media during the event. The BBC says it is \"clearly unacceptable for any of our staff to be attacked for doing their job.\"\n\n\"I didn't know what was going on,\" Skeans said, according to the BBC, describing the moment when his camera suddenly skewed down and away from the stage. Video footage showed a Trump supporter yelling obscenities as he was restrained and taken away from the area.\n\nThe disruption forced Trump to pause his remarks. Shielding his eyes to see better, the president asked, \"You all right? Everything OK?\"\n\nHe then flashed a thumbs-up in Skeans' direction.\n\nOther BBC staff members who were at the event said the Trump supporter went after a group of news teams and that the cameraman had seemingly taken the worst of it.\n\n\"The crowd had been whipped up into a frenzy against the media by Trump and other speakers all night,\" BBC Washington producer Eleanor Montague said on Twitter.\n\nIn a statement a BBC spokesperson sent to NPR, the news outlet says Skeans was \"violently pushed and shoved\" before his attacker was removed.\n\n\"Ron is fine,\" the BBC says. It also notes, \"The president could see the incident and checked with us that all was OK.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly called the news media the enemy of the people and accused journalists of creating fake news in an effort to make him look bad.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, \"President Trump condemns all acts of violence against any individual or group of people \u2014 including members of the press. We ask that anyone attending an event do so in a peaceful and respectful manner.\"\n\nShe directed those with questions about security arrangements at Trump campaign events to \"contact the campaign directly.\"\n\nThe incident at the El Paso rally comes nearly two years after the president used the term \"enemy of the people\" in a controversial tweet to describe ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and The New York Times.\n\nAfter Trump steadily used the phrase to describe the media last summer, he met with New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger to discuss the invective.\n\nBut days after that meeting, CNN's Jim Acosta posted a video from a camera position at a Trump event in Tampa, Fla., showed dozens of the president's supporters shouting insults and making hostile gestures at the news outlet's staff.\n\nTrump's rallies have triggered altercations before, and he has discussed the idea of whether protesters who come to the rallies should be \"roughed up\" or punched in the face.\n\nDespite Trump's professed disdain for the media, he has long shown a hunger to make headlines and gain attention for himself. At Monday night's rally, for instance, he pointedly drew the rally attendees' attention to the bank of media who were covering the event.\n\n\"Wow, look at all the press back [there]. Can you believe that?\" Trump said, prompting loud boos to echo through the auditorium.\n\n\"This is like the Academy Awards used to be,\" the president said. \"They've gone down a long way since they started hitting us a little bit, right?\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/12/693616068/the-women-behind-the-songs-holly-knight", "text": "The Women Behind The Songs: Holly Knight\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matthew Beard/Courtesy of the artist Matthew Beard/Courtesy of the artist\n\nHolly Knight helped define the sound of '80s pop music.

He's still got his goatee.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED TEACHER: So there are a few different things that I'd like to...\n\nGRINGLAS: In class, he has his laptop up. He's showing me pictures from a summer trip to Europe with his girlfriend, Maddie.\n\nZEIF: We rented a ATV and did the whole island in like a day and a half.\n\nGRINGLAS: After class, we walk through this big pedestrian green on campus. Kids are whizzing by on skateboards, posted up in hammocks slung from palm trees. UCF is a big school, almost 70,000 students. At the same time, it seems like Parkland kids are everywhere.\n\nZEIF: How you doing, Amanda? She's from Douglas. See? Just like that.\n\nGRINGLAS: The day I arrive, it seems like everyone's talking about this one story in the news.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: You heard what happened recently though with the guy with the bump stock?\n\nZEIF: Yeah. Yeah. Literally - did you hear about that?\n\nGRINGLAS: Campus police had just arrested an engineering student who'd been carrying around a modified AR-15 in the back of his car - a reminder, Sam says, that what happened in Parkland could happen here too.\n\nZEIF: I don't really feel safe anywhere, especially here with all these kids. I won't feel safe anywhere, I don't think, ever.\n\nGRINGLAS: On top of that, Guac and Sam were both planning to be at this school, and Sam notices that absence all the time.\n\nZEIF: I've always said like, I don't need to go to a therapist because I talk to my friends. But I still have so much, like, racing around in my mind about it.\n\nGRINGLAS: He's thinking maybe he does need therapy, though he hasn't seen anyone yet. We take a break. Sam grabs a bagel for lunch...\n\nZEIF: Dude, I seriously have so much extra lox.\n\nGRINGLAS: ...Skips computer lab, goes to sociology class. Then he gives his friend from the Stoneman Douglas basketball team a ride home. His name is Sam Vecchio. We're riding past strip malls back to Sam's off-campus apartment complex. And from the backseat, Sam Vecchio passes up his phone. He got one of those Snapchat notifications with a memory. It's a photo of Guac in the locker room grinning at the camera.\n\nSAM VECCHIO: Saying like, every day, new memories pop up. It's just...\n\nZEIF: Painful.\n\nVECCHIO: Yeah.\n\nGRINGLAS: The surprise reminders are painful, but it's not like they don't want to remember. Many of them even have tattoos.\n\nVECCHIO: His initials and his birthday.\n\nZEIF: You and Cole (ph) and Dill (ph) have like my favorite ones.\n\nVECCHIO: This isn't coming off, like, carrying him with me. He's on my body.\n\nGRINGLAS: Suddenly, Sam Vecchio is talking about the aftermath of the shooting.\n\nVECCHIO: When everything happened, it was good that we were all hanging around each other. It was like our grieving process. Like, we needed to be with each other. We don't want to be alone.\n\nGRINGLAS: We drop him off at his place.\n\nZEIF: Later.\n\nGRINGLAS: Sam Zeif tells me he's never heard his friend open up like that.\n\nZEIF: A lot of guys, like, you know how it is. Like, a lot of guys don't talk about their feelings. So, like, it's hard for them to talk about something so strong in their life.\n\nGRINGLAS: Sam lives with three roommates, two he knew back in Parkland. His longtime girlfriend Maddie Marinkovich goes here, too. They've got two little dogs.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DOGS BARKING, GROWLING)\n\nGRINGLAS: It's nice being with people who all knew Guac. Of course, they're meeting new people all the time, and that can be hard. Like the other week at a party, a girl kept asking Sam why he looks so familiar.\n\nZEIF: And I'm, like, I don't know. I don't think we've ever met before. She's like, no, you're Guac's friend.\n\nGRINGLAS: She'd seen him on the news. He's done a lot of TV interviews, and so he's recognizable.\n\nZEIF: I just said, yeah, that's me.\n\nGRINGLAS: He broke down and had to leave. At home, though, the friends mostly try to keep things light.\n\nMADDIE MARINKOVICH: What is it?\n\nZEIF: I got one so far.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: One, one, one, one, one.\n\nGRINGLAS: They play online trivia, go dancing at this 18-and-up club nearby. They don't talk every day about the trauma they've gone through together, but each person you pull aside is navigating their grief differently.\n\nMARINKOVICH: You have to try to distract yourself so it doesn't eat you alive.\n\nGRINGLAS: That's how Maddie deals with Guac's death. She says it was a different story for Sam, and that was hard on their relationship.\n\nMARINKOVICH: I mean, he just could not take his mind off of it. That's the only thing he thought about, and it was upsetting me because I saw him so upset. But eventually, like, he understood, and we made it work.\n\nGRINGLAS: Everyone is dreading Valentine's Day - the anniversary.\n\nCOLE SUMNER: You know, it's just kind of going to suck for a lot of us because we're going to see everybody trying to be happy and, you know, being romantic on that day. And it'll just - that day will really never be the same for any of us.\n\nGRINGLAS: That's another friend from home, Cole Sumner. Cole knew Guac since they were 5 years old.\n\nSUMNER: Some days are better than others, and sometimes it just eats at you kind of all day. And, you know, you just - you build up, and you get mad, and you get frustrated, and you get sad all at once. That's usually when I call my mom, and she calms me down. And that's, you know, that's when she cries too a little bit sometimes but, you know, usually ends up making both of us feel a little bit better.\n\nGRINGLAS: When Joaquin Oliver was killed, that one death upended dozens of lives. To cope, Cole calls his mom, Maddie tries to keep her mind off it, Sam Vecchio doesn't really talk about it, and Sam Zeif can't stop talking about it. He even talks to Guac when he's alone.\n\nZEIF: I just ask him, like, how he's doing. And if I need guidance on something, I ask for a sign.\n\nGRINGLAS: Sam is also still grappling with being a public figure. For one, he wonders whether his admission to college here hinged on that.\n\nZEIF: I probably wouldn't be at UCF, to be honest, if I didn't go to the White House and stuff. I think about that a lot.\n\nGRINGLAS: Does that hurt to think about, you got this good thing out of this really bad thing?\n\nZEIF: Yeah, it really does. But, I mean, I also think about it, and I wouldn't - like, I would trade anything to go back again and not have this happen, trade anything. I don't care if I don't go to school here or nothing.\n\nGRINGLAS: Sometimes, when he's really missing Guac, he scrolls through old pictures on his phone - Guac chugging sake at a fancy restaurant.\n\nZEIF: (Laughter).\n\nGRINGLAS: There he is jumping in a fountain, in sweatpants dancing in his bedroom...\n\nZEIF: He's just a angel.\n\nGRINGLAS: ...A video belting out his favorite song in the car.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I WANT TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS\")\n\nFOREIGNER: (Singing) I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.\n\nGRINGLAS: For a moment, it's like Guac's here again. Sam laughs, reliving it. And then the video ends.\n\nZEIF: It's crazy.\n\nGRINGLAS: Sam snaps back to his bedroom, to his first year of college away from home, to a looming anniversary of a really horrible day.

Medicine's Racism Problems Go Even Deeper\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP\n\nVirginia Gov. Ralph Northam is embroiled in controversy for admitting that he wore blackface at a party in the 1980s and for a racist photo on his medical school yearbook page. But the governor, a pediatric neurologist by training, told CBS he isn't resigning, because \"Virginia needs someone that can heal. There's no better person to do that than a doctor.\"\n\nNPR spoke with another doctor, Damon Tweedy, about what message it sends to black patients to hear a prominent doctor tell the country that he has worn blackface. Tweedy is the author of Black Man in a White Coat: A Doctor's Reflections on Race and Medicine and is an associate professor of psychiatry at Duke University.\n\nThe debate in Virginia is only one episode in a long history of racism in medicine, Tweedy says. Many African-Americans may feel distrustful of physicians, stemming in part from the legacy of the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment. This distrust has repercussions for the health of black people in America today, who may be less likely to stick with treatments or participate in medical research.\n\nTweedy says he hopes the debate will generate more open conversations about the way bias works its way into the health care system.\n\nOur interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nWhat's your response to the photo with the guy in blackface and the other guy in Klansman robes in a medical school yearbook?\n\nThe first thought I had was what that might mean for the patients. One of the problems is that if we just sort of make it all about Gov. Northam, that in some ways kind of misses the point. Someone had to take that photo; someone had to put that into a yearbook. And you think about it, that medical school was in a community that at the time \u2014 even now \u2014 was 40 percent African-American.\n\nWhat does that mean for those patients, that there's this tacit acceptance of these attitudes about race? And further, 1984 is not that long ago. People are still in practice who trained in 1984. Many of them are the generation that supervised me as I was coming in, training.\n\nLay out for me briefly, what the history of tension is between the American medical community and African-Americans?\n\nIt dates back to the beginnings of our country, in some ways. The most famous example in modern times is the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, which basically was run by the U.S. Public Health Service and investigated the natural history of syphilis in African-American men. Even after treatment was available, the researchers never notified the men that they had syphilis or that there was treatment available. It was the most egregious example that we know of.\n\nBut in some ways it follows a much larger history of concerns, not just in the research realm but in the clinical realm. It's very much an oral history among African-American people. You often find that people have a concern or mistrust that they are being experimented upon or that the medical establishment in some way doesn't have their best interest at heart.\n\nWhen you were in medical school back in the '90s, was race ever addressed in the curriculum or in practical training in your residency?\n\nDuring that time there was just starting to be those conversations. Maybe an hour, out of a four-year curriculum, an hour or two. Think about that. I think that a lot of times people think that if you're a doctor, you're very intelligent, you're sophisticated, and somehow you're not as susceptible to these issues of bias and racism in a way that other people might be. I think that's shortsighted.\n\nI'm a professor myself, and I've used this recent event as a sort of a teaching opportunity. You know, had discussions with students where we've sort of really openly talked about what do these issues mean.\n\nI wonder if you have any advice for Gov. Northam, one doctor to another?\n\nI'm not sure how much he might listen to me, but I'm less interested in the idea of him resigning or not. Regardless of what happens there, he does need to find a way to use his story, not out of self-interest but in terms of moving forward the conversation in other medical schools and medical settings. How might someone who thinks that they've been well meaning and educated and all that sort of thing, how might they still have made mistakes that could have potentially harmed people?\n\nWhat are the most glaring racial health disparities you see today in your teaching or in your practice?\n\nI'm in psychiatry, personally, but it really transcends every medical specialty. There's been a body of research that shows that these disparities come across in every way because really they derive from society ... from social inequality, economic inequality. That so much drives the kind of care people can receive, where they can receive it, if they can receive it at all. It really cuts across every specialty. Doctors need to learn that they're part of this larger social world.\n\nJustine Kenin produced and Selena Simmons-Duffin edited the audio version of this interview.

On Feb. 1, a racist photo in Gov. Ralph Northam's 1984 yearbook surfaced. Immediately, some lawmakers called for his resignation.\n\nNortham has denied that he appears in the photo where one man wears blackface and the other a white Ku Klux Klan robe, but he has admitted to wearing blackface in the early 1980s while dressing as Michael Jackson.\n\nStill, Northam has made it clear that he is not going anywhere. And Attorney General Mark Herring, who has admitted to wearing blackface the same decade, hasn't indicated he will step down either.\n\nIt's been a roller coaster of a story that confounds many across the country. That includes teachers in Virginia classrooms trying to talk to their students about the scandals embroiling the top elected officials in the state.\n\n\"I just want to know ... why anyone would think it was a good idea to put that photo in that yearbook?\" asks Justin Daniels, an 18-year-old senior at Thomas Jefferson High School in Richmond.\n\nHe and some friends from school have been talking a lot about the news that has consumed their city for the past week and a half. Daniels is African-American, like a majority of the students at Thomas Jefferson. One thing they're pondering: whether Northam's and Herring's decisions to put shoe polish and brown makeup on their faces 30 years ago could be chalked up to youthful indiscretion.\n\n\"I'm 16 years old and I know not to do that,\" says Hannah Clark. She wants to see Northam resign, pointing out he was an adult when he dressed in blackface as Michael Jackson.\n\n\"Now, I know that the time period might be different, but I don't want to create excuses for this man because he was a man at that point,\" Clark says. \"He should have known not to do this.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Megan Pauly/WCVE Megan Pauly/WCVE\n\nTheir classmate Shannon Williams is hesitant to call for Northam and Herring to resign, but not because she thinks blackface is OK. \"Even though what they have done is wrong \u2014 I strongly believe what they did was wrong \u2014 and even though they 'apologized' for it, I believe that the people that will come after them in office probably have done worse things.\"\n\nAnother student, Geovanny Mejia, says if their white friends dressed in blackface today, they'd probably get beaten up. \"I'm not sure why it took us this long to get to that conclusion that it is bad to do blackface,\" Mejia says. \"Like after all, it was just used to ridicule black people. And like, why would it even cross your mind that that would be a good thing to do, like, 'Haha, it's so funny?' \"\n\nDaniels, Clark, Williams and Mejia are all taking the same art class. Their teacher, Stuart Harnsberger, has been working Richmond's current events into class.\n\n\"I think the vast majority of the class knew what blackface was, or is,\" Harnsberger says. \"I don't know that too many had seen an actual example.\"\n\nHe showed his class the yearbook photo and a video of a minstrel show and says most of the students seemed shocked and alarmed.\n\n\"I think each time that we have these discussions in class, I'm able to earn a little bit of trust from students,\" Harnsberger says. \"I'm not going to shut them down.\" He says he makes it clear that everyone's opinion is worth hearing.\n\nA spokesperson for Virginia's Department of Education said it is \"preparing a list of vetted resources to help teachers with classroom discussions related to the events of the last week.\" The American School Counselor Association also has a resource page to help school counselors and educators support students when there are troubling current events.\n\nAs for whether Harnsberger thinks his conversations with students will shape how they think about their own actions going forward? He hopes so.\n\n\"I was walking around in the cafeteria and a student pulled out her phone and showed me an image of a Gucci sweater that indicated somebody with blackface on the sweater. It apparently got pulled from Gucci,\" Harnsberger says. \"And she was able to make a direct connection between what we're talking about in class and what she saw on her phone.\"\n\nNick Cenname, who teaches eighth-grade civics and economics in a neighboring school district, says he felt like he and his students couldn't ignore all the noise coming out of the statehouse, just 15 minutes away. \"I let them look at the photo and they're like, 'Wow, that's pretty racist.' \" Cenname says these conversations are helping engage students who might not otherwise be interested in what's happening in state politics.\n\n\"One kid told me he downloaded CNN on his phone just to see what was going on with the governor of Virginia,\" Cenname says. \"If scandal is what it takes to get you involved in current events, then that's fine.\"\n\nDaniels, the student from Thomas Jefferson, says he is disappointed in how little progress the country has made when it comes to race.\n\n\"I feel like as a whole in America, we've been putting off the conversation and people keep saying that we can't get over racism. But we've never really talked about it openly,\" Daniels says.\n\n\"Because it feels like people are too scared to talk about it because it'll, I guess, open up old wounds that really have never healed? I mean, is it really an old wound if the wound is like fresh every day?\"\n\nHe's not exactly sure where the conversation should go next. The most important thing, he says, is that it keeps happening."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/11/691467587/americans-seek-cheaper-meds-in-mexico", "text": "American Travelers Seek Cheaper Prescription Drugs In Mexico And Beyond\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Guillermo Arias/Bloomberg via Getty Images Guillermo Arias/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhen Michelle Fenner signed up to run this year's Los Angeles Marathon, it got her thinking: Tijuana, Mexico, is only a 2 1/2-hour drive from LA. Why not take a trip across the border and buy some insulin for her son?\n\n\"It's so easy to just go across the border,\" Fenner mused.\n\nThis idea had been in the back of Fenner's mind for a while. Her son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes nine years ago, meaning he needs daily injections of insulin to stay alive. The list price of the modern generation of insulin has skyrocketed since then. On one trip to the pharmacy last year, Fenner was told that a three-month supply of insulin would cost her $3,700.\n\nThat same supply would cost only about $600 in Mexico.\n\nSo when she booked her trip to Los Angeles, Fenner says, \"I decided we need to update our passports and go and get more insulin.\"\n\nFenner is not the only one thinking like this. The U.S. government estimates that close to 1 million people in California alone cross to Mexico annually for health care, including to buy prescription drugs. And between 150,000 and 320,000 Americans list health care as a reason for traveling abroad each year. Cost savings is the most commonly cited reason.\n\n'Right to Shop' legislation\n\nIn Utah last year, the Public Employee Health Plan took this idea to a new level with its voluntary Pharmacy Tourism Program. For certain PEHP members who use any of 13 costly prescription medications \u2014 including the popular arthritis drug Humira \u2014 the insurer will foot the bill to fly the patient and a companion to San Diego, then drive them to a hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, to pick up a 90-day supply of medicine.\n\n\"The average cost of an eligible drug in the US is over $4,500 per month and is 40-60% less in Mexico,\" PEHP Clinical Services Director Travis Tolley said in an announcement of the program last October.\n\nThe program was part of a Right to Shop bill championed by health care economist and Utah state representative Norm Thurston in 2018. Thurston says there is not yet enough data to know how much in savings the program provides; the first patients traveled to Tijuana in December.\n\nBut, Thurston says, he expects that in the next six months, savings will likely be \"in the ballpark of $1 million.\"\n\nThere are some questions about traveling abroad to buy prescription drugs, however. The first: Is it legal?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, \"in most circumstances, it is illegal for individuals to import drugs into the United States for personal use.\" But the agency's website does provide guidance about when it could be allowed. And the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's website has a whole section on traveling with medications in its \"Know Before You Go\" guide.\n\nWhile the guidelines may still leave you with questions, Thurston says this sort of purchase for personal use is a widely established practice.\n\n\"When we talked to people about this, there has never been a single person who has been prosecuted for doing it. And it happens every day at every border crossing all over the country,\" Thurston says.\n\n\"The general understanding is you can bring up to a 90-day supply of a prescription from overseas, even though it's a technical violation,\" says Nathan Cortez, a law professor at Southern Methodist University.\n\n\n\n\"My sense is the FDA does not want to worry about individuals going overseas and bringing back small amounts of prescriptions that last a few months,\" Cortez says, adding, \"That doesn't mean the FDA couldn't change its mind at any point and start cracking down.\"\n\nA second major concern that comes up in any discussion of medical tourism is about the quality of that imported medicine. According to the FDA, the reason it's mostly illegal to import drugs is because the agency \"cannot ensure the safety and effectiveness\" of those drugs. In 2017, the World Health Organization estimated that 10 percent of drugs in developing countries were either substandard or falsified.\n\nTo address that problem, the Utah program sends its patients only to a designated, accredited Mexican hospital. Individual patients like Michelle Fenner are left to take their own precautions.\n\n\"You get a little nervous. You want to make sure that you have a reputable pharmacy,\" Fenner says. To get pharmacy recommendations, she has been consulting with friends and acquaintances who have purchased insulin in Mexico. She's calling those pharmacies now to make sure they have the type of insulin she wants to buy. When the marathon gets closer, she's planning to call ahead with her order.\n\nFenner says the amount she's expecting to save on insulin could warrant multiple trips to Mexico every year.\n\nGlobal savings\n\nFenner is just one of the growing number of activists online who are discussing the great lengths they go to \u2014 sometimes literally \u2014 to afford insulin. Lija Greenseid is another. Her daughter has Type 1 diabetes.\n\nAlmost one year to the day after her daughter's diagnosis, Greenseid and her family were visiting Quebec City, Canada, in July 2014. Her daughter's blood sugar started spiking and Greenseid feared her insulin might have gone bad, so she went to a pharmacy. With no prescription and fearing that her daughter's life was on the line, Greenseid was prepared to pay a fortune.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Greenseid/Courtesy of the Greenseid family Andrew Greenseid/Courtesy of the Greenseid family\n\nInstead the box of insulin pens that normally costs $700 in the U.S. was only around $65 or so.\n\n\"At that point I started tearing up. I could not believe how inexpensive it was and how easy it was,\" Greenseid says.\n\n\"I said to [the pharmacist], 'Do you have any idea what it's like to get insulin in the United States? It's just so much more expensive.' And he turned to me and said, 'Why would we want to make it difficult? You need insulin to live.' \"\n\nThe more Greenseid traveled with her family, the more they realized how inexpensive insulin was everywhere except in the United States. In Nuremberg, Germany, she could get that $700 box of insulin pens for $73. The same box was $57 in Tel Aviv, Israel, $51 in Greece, $61 in Rome and $40 in Taiwan.\n\n\"We get so accustomed in the United States to thinking that health care has to be difficult and so expensive that people don't even consider the fact that it could be so much easier and less expensive in other places,\" Greenseid says. \"In fact, that is the case in most countries.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/10/683063237/minnesota-sen-amy-klobuchar-expected-to-launch-2020-presidential-bid", "text": "Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar Launches 2020 Presidential Bid\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 4:56 p.m. ET\n\nMinnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced she's running for president on Sunday afternoon, joining a crowded and historically diverse field of candidates seeking to defeat President Trump.\n\nShe is the fifth Democratic senator to launch a White House bid, with others still contemplating joining a primary field that has grown to 11 candidates.\n\nThe three-term senator cast herself as a practical, Midwestern problem-solver focused on results, not ideology.\n\n\"We are tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, of the gridlock and the grandstanding,\" said Klobuchar during a snowy, cold outdoor event in a park in Minneapolis. \"Our nation must be governed not by chaos but by opportunity.\"\n\nThe 58-year-old Klobuchar was elected to the Senate in 2006 \u2014 the first elected female senator from Minnesota \u2014 and has been re-elected easily twice since. Before coming to Congress, she was the Hennepin County Attorney for eight years, serving as the chief prosecutor for the state's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. In that role, she secured almost 300 murder convictions and worked to curtail gun crimes.\n\nHer prosecutorial style was on display during last year's hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault when he was younger. Klobuchar pressed Kavanaugh on whether he had ever been drinking so much he had blacked out and the defiant nominee threw the question back at her. Kavanaugh would later apologize, but the issue was deeply personal for Klobuchar, whose father, a well-known sports columnist in Minnesota, was an alcoholic.\n\nIn the Senate, she's championed consumer protection issues, backed stricter online privacy regulations and worked on lowering the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nKlobuchar isn't as progressive as some of her potential Democratic competitors. She hasn't supported a Medicare for All plan, though she has said it \"should be considered,\" and she hasn't called for other far-left ideas such as abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement all together. Klobuchar is seen as more of a pragmatist on Capitol Hill, with her vote rankings typically putting her somewhat in the middle of the Democratic caucus.\n\n\"It is time to organize, time to galvanize, time to take back our democracy,\" said Klobuchar, who called for getting money out of politics, strengthening voting rights, combating global warming, reducing income inequality and making healthcare more affordable.\n\nIndirectly addressing President Trump, Klobuchar said, \"stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate.\"\n\nCompared to many of her colleagues, Klobuchar hasn't sought the media spotlight that much and doesn't have the same kind of social media or fundraising presence that some of her rivals do, a point she sought to counter in her announcement speech.\n\n\"I don't have a political machine. I don't come from money. But what I do have is this: I have grit,\" said Klobuchar.\n\nIn the past week, Klobuchar has been dogged by anonymous, published accusations that she has mistreated her staff. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Klobuchar didn't specifically deny any of the allegations.\n\n\"Yes, I can be tough,\" said Klobuchar. \"And, yes, I can push people. I know that. And I have high expectations for myself. I have high expectations for the people that work for me. But I have high expectations for this country. And that's what we need.\"\n\nHer presidential announcement is no surprise. She's been making political visits to neighboring Iowa for several years and has hinted for a long time she was seriously weighing a run.\n\n\"I will say that I have made very clear that I am looking at this,\" she told MSNBC on Jan. 15. \"I also had said I wanted to talk to my family, so big news today: My family is on board, including my in-laws, showing some momentum. But I will make this decision on my own course regardless of what other candidates are doing.\"\n\nShe also has argued that her background and geographical base could help her in a general election, as opposed to other candidates.\n\nThe Midwest helped Trump win his unexpected victory in 2016.

How?\n\nIn the city of Kabul, Afghanistan, there is a \"green, leafy oasis\" called Shahr-e Naw Park \u2014 a place that briefly became a staging ground for conservation scientists.\n\nIn The Snow Leopard Project and other Adventures in Warzone Conservation, Alex Dehgan describes how his Wildlife Conservation Society team hid stuffed animals throughout the park, simulating as best they could the wildlife the scientists might find on their upcoming survey mission in a remote, rugged province called Nuristan.\n\n\"The whole undertaking took on a comic air: the teams, dressed in traditional Pashtu clothing from Nuristan, lumbered under the weight of their equipment,\" Dehgan writes. \"They wandered slowly through the park, using high-powered binoculars and laser range finders to hunt for plush toys.\"\n\nThe image may be comical, but the environmental science Dehgan describes in the book is serious, and fascinating. In Nuristan alone are found populations of various leopards, Asiatic black bears, and a mountain goat called the markhor, able to climb vertical cliffs with aplomb. Dehgan describes the region as a \"fairy-tale landscape\" of craggy cliffs, cedar and oak forests, and \"narrow perilous trails.\" The Hindu Kush mountains forced the scientists, when they eventually arrived in Nuristan from Kabul, to proceed on foot; not even pack animals could manage the terrain.\n\nAll the training paid off. Over a two-year period, the team documented evidence of the animals noted plus more, including rhesus macaques, Afghanistan's only non-human primate, and musk deer, of which there hadn't been a confirmed sighting in 60 years. The deer had survived, Dehgan notes, \"despite bombs, insurgency, deforestation, hunting, and war.\"\n\nWar is the backdrop for everything recounted in this book. Dehgan focuses on the years 2006-2007, when he served as Wildlife Conservation Society country director in charge of the Afghanistan Biodiversity Conservation Program. Thirty years of war, including the Russian invasion in 1979, the American invasion in 2001, and the ongoing Taliban insurgency, left widespread regions of the country in ruins.\n\nA primary goal of the conservation program was to establish the country's first national park. (The mission of the more than 100-year-old WCS, which runs five zoos and aquariums in New York City, is to save wildlife and green spaces.) Band-e-Amir, \"Afghanistan's answer to the Grand Canyon,\" is located in Bamiyan Province, home to the famous, massive Buddha statues that were toppled by the Taliban in 2001. Its choice as a site for a national park required coordination at the village, district, provincial and national levels, with \"conflicting visions every step of the way,\" Dehgan writes. He explains in the epilogue that despite enormous challenges, Band-e Amir indeed did become Afghanistan's first national park in 2009, followed five years later by Wakhan National Park in an area called \"the rooftop of the world\" to which Dehgan devotes a riveting chapter. These parks boosted protection of scores of vulnerable animal species.\n\nReaders who expect, from the volume's title, to sink into a story about snow leopards will learn that these large solitary cats are adapted to mountain living by way of their enormous paws and thick long tails, that they prey on sheep and goats, that decrease in available rangelands has negatively affected their populations \u2014 and not a great deal more. A slightly misleading title turns out, in this case, to be the antithesis of a disappointment. The broad scope of The Snow Leopard Project makes for compelling reading, not least because it corrects assumptions some of us may have picked up about Afghanistan during these 18 long years of war. Most Americans view Afghanistan, Dehgan writes, \"as an inhospitable, dusty land of mud houses, thick clay walls, and bearded, turbaned men and women in burkas.\" The reality, of course, is much more complex \u2014 and more beautiful.\n\nIt's a marvelous choice for Dehgan to put himself in the middle of the story. He mixes humor and pathos in describing how he found himself in Afghanistan following stints as a lemur biologist in Madagascar and working for the U.S. State Dept. helping \"redirect\" Iraqi weapons scientists toward nation-building, scientific ventures.\n\nRecruited by the WCS after delivering a talk on Iraq at an academic conference, once in Afghanistan he lives through absurd situations and even some close calls. He is dryly funny about some of the mishaps, even the ones that endangered his well-being: the time he was stuck in a no-man's land between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, briefly unable to enter either country; or the time he ran excitedly out of a vehicle to view raptors only to realize he was probably standing in the middle of an active minefield. A harrowing encounter just outside the gates of Bagram Airfield results from his efforts to educate both locals and foreigners \u2014 including U.S. military personnel \u2014 about the harms of the illegal trade in products such as lynx and snow leopard comforters.\n\nDehgan is clearly moved by the enormous dedication of his international team of scientists and by the kindness and determination of the Afghan people, who, he says, viewed protection of wildlife as \"a chance to rebuild the core identity of who they were.\" There's no hint here of a self-styled American savior coming to a war-torn land in order to force Western fixes onto local people. An Iranian-American, Dehgan describes his desire to \"provide another voice in [the United States'] engagement with the Islamic world.\" Along with colleagues whom he credits liberally, he helps ensure not only that local people are hired for conservation work but also that Afghan students are empowered to assume scientific leadership in their country.\n\nThe Snow Leopard Project illuminates a vital area of science \u2014 and a country filled with natural and cultural beauty.

But her effort now seems doomed, after the king spoke out against his sister's bid for office.\n\nHours after Ubolratana's campaign registration papers were filed, the royal palace issued a statement in which the king said her candidacy is \"inappropriate\" and \"unconstitutional,\" according to a translation by journalist Saksith Saiyasombut of Channel News Asia.\n\nThe princess's candidacy landed like a bombshell when her name was submitted to the election commission on Friday. The move would have pit Ubolratana, 67, against current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of the military junta that ousted former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014.\n\nUbolratana was put forth as the lone candidate from the Thai Raksa Chart Party, which includes members loyal to Yingluck Shinawatra and her brother, another ousted former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nUbolratana declared herself a \"commoner\" candidate, reports The Nation, with the princess saying she would seek office not as a member of royalty but as a regular citizen.\n\n\"For the Thai Raksa Chart Party to nominate me to be a candidate for prime minister is a display of rights and freedoms and shows that I have no privileges over the Thai public under the current charter,\" the princess is quoted saying on her private Instagram account.\n\nUbolratana relinquished her royal title in 1972, when she married American Peter Jensen; the two had met as students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The princess lived in the U.S. for years, but after the couple divorced in 1998, she then moved to Thailand, where she is still referred to as a princess and a member of the royal family.\n\nOn Friday, Ubolratana was threatening to redraw lines of allegiance in Thai society, as a member of the monarchy who wanted to run against the leader of the pro-royalist military. But the king said that despite her previous revocation of the official title of princess, she remains part of the royal dynasty and is precluded from politics.\n\nDespite her assertion of commoner status, the princess's entry into politics quickly raised several legal questions, including how campaigns against her might be carried out without running afoul of Thailand's strict laws against speaking ill of royalty. Another issue centers on whether her candidacy would be legal under the constitution.\n\nThailand's election commission officially has until Feb. 15 to accept or reject the princess's candidacy for the March 24 elections. But it now seems certain the king's rebuke will effectively quash her foray into politics.\n\nShortly after Ubolratana's name was submitted, her political rivals sought to have her candidacy revoked. As the Bangkok Post reports, \"the pro-military People's Reform Party asked the Election Commission to rule if the Thai Raksa Chart Party violated the election law\" by making the nomination.\n\nThe issue, the People's Reform Party says, is that Thai law bans political candidates from using the monarchy to bolster their campaigns.\n\nTo conform with the law, the Thai Raksa Chart made the unusual declaration that its campaign materials for a national election will not use photos of Ubolratana.\n\n\"I assure you that the party will neither post images of the princess anywhere nor use them for campaigning,\" the party's Secretary-General Wim Rungwattanachinda said, according to the Bangkok Post.\n\nThe princess's full name is Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi. The registration papers that shook up Thailand's upcoming election listed her legal residence as \"Boromphiman Throne Hall\" and \"inside the Grand Palace,\" according to the Associated Press."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/692466456/cryptocurrency-exchange-operator-dies-without-sharing-passwords-with-anyone", "text": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Operator Dies Without Sharing Passwords With Anyone\n\nNPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with Nolan Bauerle, head of research at Coindesk, about the CEO of Quadriga, a cryptocurrency exchange, who died without sharing the password to the storage wallets.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nCash may still be king, but there are more ways to buy and sell and store our money than ever before. We're looking beyond cash in this month's All Tech Considered.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ULRICH SCHNAUSS' \"NOTHING HAPPENS IN JUNE\")\n\nKELLY: You can imagine what might happen if a bank lost the keys to the safe, and thousands of people couldn't get their hands on their own money and valuables. That is a simplified low-tech version of what has happened in Canada. The operator of a cryptocurrency exchange based there died in December without telling anyone what amounts to the passwords - the digital keys to the digital safes. Nolan Bauerle is head of research for the trade hub CoinDesk. He joins us from New York to explain what's going on here. Hi, Nolan.\n\nNOLAN BAUERLE: Hi.\n\nKELLY: So this Canadian cryptocurrency exchange is called QuadrigaCX. It allows people to trade and store money through online platforms. Is that the most basic explanation?\n\nBAUERLE: Yeah. And it does something a little niche in the market in that it's an on-ramp for cash transactions.\n\nKELLY: So you could park your cash there, too.\n\nBAUERLE: You sure can.\n\nKELLY: The CEO who died - he knew what the digital keys were, like a password. He had them stored on his personal laptop, and nobody else can get onto his laptop. Is that the situation right now?\n\nBAUERLE: Yeah. This is a really unsophisticated way to run a company that supposedly has this many digital assets under control.\n\nKELLY: OK.\n\nBAUERLE: It looks like the key management policies of this exchange were almost old-fashioned in this industry.\n\nKELLY: Ye olden days of digital currency (laughter). Go on.\n\nBAUERLE: We have developed as an industry multiple ways to manage these keys safely where three or four people would sign off on a transaction. It looks like what they did here was they gave all the authority to one person. So there's a single point of failure in this exchange.\n\nKELLY: Getting into a laptop, cracking the password for that - that seems like a relatively manageable problem for a smart hacker, or no?\n\nBAUERLE: I think so. And right now what's happening in Canada is Ernst and Young has involved themselves in this case. And they are going to be looking into getting into this laptop. So Quadriga has tried to get into the laptop for a while. We'll find out now where the case is with Ernst and Young - if this is possible.\n\nKELLY: It is also theoretically possible that all this money - and we're talking well over $100 million - that it could maybe be locked away forever.\n\nBAUERLE: Yeah, that is absolutely a scenario here.\n\nKELLY: This is making me want to hide all my money in a big wad under the mattress.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKELLY: Which prompts me to ask, who had put their money into Quadriga - elite investors investing hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars, or is this ordinary...\n\nBAUERLE: No, this is hundreds of thousands of accounts of small retail investors.\n\nKELLY: Are there laws that are supposed to regulate how you manage your crypto keys?\n\nBAUERLE: Different jurisdictions have different laws. In Canada, what it looks like is, mostly, money service business is law. So they have to show that they have, you know, a certain amount of reserves.\n\nKELLY: But meanwhile, is this giving people who might be thinking about investing in cryptocurrency pause?\n\nBAUERLE: I think it definitely should give everyone a chance to think again, but these are lessons that have been spoken about very openly by the community for a long time. Don't put your keys with an exchange for an extended period of time or a long time.\n\nKELLY: Nolan Bauerle. He's head of research for CoinDesk.

Then we reached Auschwitz.\"\n\nHeisler's mother and grandfather were murdered at the concentration camp. She and her sister, sent on to a labor camp, survived on leftover potato peels.\n\nNow 93, the bright-eyed great-grandmother lives in a cozy apartment in Budapest, a city she proudly calls home. But she has no illusions about the role her country played decades before. \"We didn't see any German soldiers until we reached Auschwitz,\" she says. \"It was Hungarians who deported us.\"\n\nShe says Hungary has never been able to face its complicity. That's why she and many other Hungarian Jews are skeptical of a new Holocaust museum in development in Budapest, costing more than $23 million and financed by the Hungarian state. The building was finished in 2015, but unease over what it will present has delayed its opening in the years since.\n\nHeisler says the museum organizers want to portray Hungarians as \"sin free\" in persecution of Jewish citizens.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joanna Kakissis for NPR Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n\n\"Any museum that says this is not telling the truth,\" she says.\n\nHungary's \"dubious distinction\" for revisionism\n\nA new study by researchers from Yale University, Grinnell College and the European Union for Progressive Judaism shows Holocaust revisionism is rampant in Central and Eastern Europe, with Hungary one of the worst offenders. \"Hungary has gained the dubious distinction of rewriting history to rehabilitate war criminals and diminish its own guilt,\" the report says, noting the country \"suffers from grave deficiencies in its Holocaust education, memory, and commemoration.\"\n\nMarcell Kenesei, a Hungarian Jewish educator, sees evidence of this revisionism just by walking the streets of Budapest.\n\n\"If you go to the Szabadsag Square, or Freedom Square, here, you will see a monument commemorating the victims of the Second World War, showing Nazi Germany as the only perpetrator and Hungary as an innocent angel,\" he says, referring to a controversial statue that went up five years ago depicting Hungary as the Archangel Gabriel attacked by an eagle representing Germany.\n\nHungarian Jewish leaders denounced the statue, but the nationalist government of Viktor Orban defended it. So did Maria Schmidt, a pro-government historian who conceived of the new Holocaust museum, called the House of Fates.\n\nThe name is a twist on the title of the novel Fateless by Nobel Prize-winning Hungarian writer Imre Kertesz, a Holocaust survivor.\n\nThe museum is located on the site of the defunct Jozsefvaros railway station, where many Hungarian Jews were deported to death camps. A soaring Star of David between towers with facades resembling weathered rail cars marks the museum's entrance. Historians say the fastest deportations of the Holocaust took place in Hungary, where Hungarian police throughout the country worked with German authorities to send some 437,000 Hungarian Jews to death camps between May 15 and July 9, 1944.\n\n\"They shouted anti-Jewish insults and threw things at us\"\n\nAt the time, Hungary was led by Miklos Horthy, an admiral who became regent in 1920. His regime invoked a quota restricting the number of Jews who could attend university \u2014 the first government in post-World War I Europe to do so. The restrictions later included secondary school attendance. Heisler, who grew up in the Hungarian countryside, had to stop her education at the eighth grade.\n\n\"I saw my non-Jewish classmates going to high school with their leather briefcases, in crisp uniforms, and I went to sew,\" she told a historian for an oral history.\n\nHorthy's regime closed down Heisler's grandfather's vinegar factory and sent her father to a labor camp. It passed laws rolling back equal citizenship, forbidding intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews and restricting the kinds of jobs Hungarian Jews could hold.\n\n\"For all my life, I have been an anti-Semite,\" Horthy wrote to his prime minister in 1940, the same year his government joined the Axis alliance.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sean Gallup/Getty Images Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nHeisler says that attitude spread throughout Hungary, and she recalls how neighbors and friends began to avoid her.\n\n\"I remember the boy I loved at 15, the one who danced with me at the school ball, stopped talking to me,\" she says. \"So did the daughters of the local police chief, who used to come around all the time.\"\n\nAfter the Nazis occupied Hungary in March 1944, Horthy ruled \"in close conformity with German wishes,\" says Elizabeth White, a senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nHungarian police forced Heisler and her family out of their home, marching them down the street to the train station. She remembers her fellow Hungarians cheering.\n\n\"They shouted anti-Jewish insults and threw things at us,\" she said. \"The few who felt sorry for us just shut their windows and drew their curtains.\"\n\nA disputed legacy\n\nThe Nazis eventually removed Horthy and replaced his government in October 1944 with the openly fascist Arrow Cross Party, led by Ferenc Szalasi, whose regime deported thousands more Hungarian Jews by year's end. Arrow Cross soldiers shot as many as 20,000 Jews on the banks of the Danube River and threw their bodies into the river. A memorial to the dead stands there today. Israeli divers have begun to look for the remains of the murdered.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ferenc Isza/AFP/Getty Images Ferenc Isza/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPro-government historians today blame the worst anti-Semitism on the Arrow Cross regime but have tried to rehabilitate the role of Horthy, whom Orban has called an \"exceptional statesman.\"\n\nFive years ago, Orban's government established a research institute, Veritas, aimed at examining \"neglected historical periods and also setting right the ones which, in our view, have been falsely presented,\" Director Sandor Szakaly tells NPR.\n\nSzakaly argues that Horthy may not have immediately known that the 437,000 Jews his police force was rounding up and deporting after March 1944 were going to death camps.\n\n\"When Horthy found out what was happening, he stopped the deportations and wrote a letter to Hitler saying this is unacceptable,\" Szakaly says.\n\nBut Holocaust historian Laszlo Karsai, a professor emeritus at the University of Szeged, says the historical record shows Horthy knew everything.\n\n\"He was informed about the final solution of the Jewish question by the Nazis,\" Karsai says. \"And the main informant of this terrible secret was Hitler, when in April 1943, he informed Horthy that the Jews who cannot work must be perished, must be killed.\"\n\nA controversial historian\n\nKarsai says this fact must be included in Hungary's Holocaust museum. But he doesn't have faith that Schmidt, the historian who conceived of the House of Fates, will push to do so.\n\n\"Maria Schmidt is a Holocaust revisionist,\" he says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yad Vashem Photo Archives via AP Yad Vashem Photo Archives via AP\n\nTo prove his point, he takes me on a tour of the House of Terror, a hugely popular interactive museum, also created by Schmidt, that examines four decades of communist rule in Hungary.\n\nIn a room depicting the cruelty of the Arrow Cross regime during World War II, Karsai points out there's no mention of the Jews deported by Horthy's regime.\n\n\"Not a picture, not a word, about this mass deportation, the biggest and fastest mass deportation in the history of the Holocaust,\" he says.\n\nSchmidt, based in Budapest, declined NPR's interview request. Her office sent a 2014 article she wrote for a conservative newsmagazine, in which she called the concept for the House of Fates \"a story of love between Hungarian Jews and non-Jews\" and expressed hope that it will show the \"common fate shared by all Hungarians, Jews and non-Jews alike,\" during World War II.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joanna Kakissis for NPR Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n\nIn the piece, she accuses \"forces\" of unfairly calling Hungary anti-Semitic and fascist \"to discredit the Hungarian nation as a whole.\"\n\nShe has said that the Nazis were no worse than Soviet communists and also compared Hungarian Jews deported during the Holocaust to ethnic minorities ejected from Hungary after World War II.\n\n\"Didn't they live through the same personal tragedy?\" she asked asked TV host Egon Ronai in 2014.\n\nKarsai says Orban's government is preoccupied with building a heroic Hungarian identity and so there's little appetite to face dark chapters in history.\n\n\"If you speak about the Hungarian collaborators, if you speak about the participation of several hundreds of thousands of people in the persecution in Hungarian Jews, you are [seen as] an anti-Hungarian,\" he says. \"The majority of the people do not want to hear about the Hungarian culpability, only Hungary as a victim.\"\n\n\"We cannot accept any whitewashing\"\n\nIn September, Orban's government handed over ownership of the House of Fates to the United Hungarian Jewish Congregation, an affiliate of the Hasidic Chabad movement. Orban's allies point out he is a strong ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nRabbi Slomo Koves, who leads the Chabad group, says museums devoted to the Holocaust should not indict countries invaded by the Nazis.\n\n\"I think the point of opening a Holocaust museum is to give a platform of digesting the past in a way where people can still look up to some of their ancestors,\" he says, \"and some of the good choices of their ancestors and to learn from it and take from it the moral lessons that need to be taken.\"\n\nThe government has said that it hopes the museum might open by May, the 75th anniversary of when Jews were deported to the death camps. But Koves says it may take longer.\n\nHis group represents only a fraction of the estimated 100,000 Jews who live in Hungary today. Most are in Budapest, home to Europe's largest synagogue. Just around the corner from that synagogue is the headquarters of the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities, an umbrella organization representing most of the country's Jews. Its director is Andras Heisler, the son of Holocaust survivor Rozsa Heisler.\n\nHe says he is not comfortable with any Jewish organization running a Holocaust museum because \"the remembrance of the Holocaust should not be responsibility of the Jews. Not Chabad and not us, either. It should be the responsibility of the whole society.\"\n\nHeisler also points out that Chabad is more focused on religion than on the Holocaust and says it has \"no experts in the Holocaust, no practice in teaching the history.\"\n\nThat history, he says, is nonnegotiable.\n\n\"We cannot make any compromise,\" he says. \"We cannot accept any whitewashing. We cannot accept any change of the history \u2014 because in the background, there are our grandfathers, fathers and relatives and 600,000 killed Jews.\"\n\nHeisler's own grandmother was among those who perished at Auschwitz. Her husband, who once courted her with cartloads of roses, refused to believe she was gone.\n\nAfter the war ended, he asked Rozsa: \"Where did you leave your mother?\"\n\n\"He lived 87 years,\" she says now, \"and he refused to declare her dead. He did not stop hoping she would come home.\"\n\nJournalist Mate Halmos contributed reporting from Budapest."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/692466389/baseball-trailblazer-frank-robinson-dies-at-83", "text": "Baseball Trailblazer Frank Robinson Dies At 83\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nBaseball great Frank Robinson died today at the age of 83.

He could be one of the hardest-nosed people you'll ever meet. When he was a player in Baltimore, six years in Baltimore, four American League pennants. He shaped a lot of what people think of as the smartest, most efficient franchise.

And that was his legacy.\n\nHistorically, 1975 - first African-American manager. That happened three years after Jackie Robinson died. And in the same way that Jackie Robinson cleared the way for a generation of players, Frank cleared the way for other minority managers. I have seen him - as a player, he would leave bloody spike marks on a second baseman's back because the pitcher had thrown inside. I have seen him in cancer wards with kids break down and cry and have to leave. That's who Frank was.\n\nHe had - when he walked into a room, he had these big forearms, big hands.

He had gotten the job - managerial job when they were 0-6. Well, on an off night in Minneapolis, he takes a group of us out to dinner. And it was getting World Series-like coverage that - at that stretch. We said to him, Frank, anything happened since we saw you at the ballpark? And he said, well, President Reagan called. We said, Frank, don't joke about that. He said - well, what did he say? He said, Frank, I understand what you're going through. And Frank said to him, Mr. President, with all due respect, you have no bleeping idea.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKELLY: And it sounds like he was the kind of guy who could get away with talking like that to a president.\n\nJUSTICE: Absolutely.\n\nKELLY: It is extraordinary your mentioning him just in the moments we have left, both, you know, as a player who left such a mark on the field and then leaving an extraordinary legacy as a manager. Not many athletes get the chance to do both.\n\nJUSTICE: No. And he understood the importance of it. He understood that day in 1975 when he stood - when he took the lineup card out to home plate in Cleveland that he had changed the world. He was cognizant of that just the way he admired Jackie Robinson for what he did. He understood his place in the game.\n\nKELLY: Richard Justice, columnist for mlb.com, thank you.\n\nJUSTICE: Thank you, Mary Louise.\n\nKELLY: We've been talking about baseball great Frank Robinson, who died this morning at the age of 83.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

But Holocaust survivors and scholars fear the government is downplaying Hungary's history of anti-Semitism and complicity in the Nazi genocide. Joanna Kakissis reports from Budapest that this controversial museum is also deepening a rift within the local Jewish community.\n\nJOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Two towers with a soaring Star of David between them mark the entrance to Hungary's Holocaust Museum. The $23 million museum stands at what used to be Jozsefvaros railway station. It's here that 437,000 Hungarian Jews were forced to board trains to Nazi death camps between May and July of 1944. The historian who conceived this museum named it the House of Fates - a twist on the novel \"Faithless\" by Nobel Prize-winner Imre Kertesz, a Holocaust survivor himself. In 2014, that historian, Maria Schmidt, explained that the museum would largely show the unity of Hungarian Jews and non-Jews.\n\nMARIA SCHMIDT: (Through interpreter) We want to tell the story of ordinary citizens here - not political figures. Each story is about neighbors. And there are good ones as well as bad ones.\n\nKAKISSIS: But the museum's opening has been delayed for more than three years. The reason is deep concern about what may be inside it - a denial of Hungary's full role in the Holocaust. So let's look at that history. Long before Hungarian Jews were sent to death camps, Hungary had been oppressing them on its own for decades.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DOORBELL RINGING)\n\nKAKISSIS: Hi, how are you?\n\nAnti-Semitic laws dating to 1920 prevented Rozsa Heisler (ph) from going to high school and university. Heisler survived the Holocaust. Now 93 years old, she lives in a cozy apartment, where she shows me photographs of her mother and grandfather who were murdered at Auschwitz.\n\nROZSA HEISLER: (Through interpreter) In the 1930s, the Hungarian government took everything from the Jews. Our shops and factories were closed. My grandfather lost his vinegar factory.\n\nKAKISSIS: Hungary's leader back then, an admiral named Miklos Horthy, was responsible for those laws. His regime forced Jews into labor camps - all before German troops invaded Hungary. Even after the invasion, it was Hungarian police who rounded up Heisler and her family. Heisler remembers walking down the street to the train that would take her to Auschwitz.\n\nR HEISLER: (Through interpreter) Most people cheered because we were leaving. They shouted anti-Jewish insults and threw things at us. The few who felt sorry for us just shut their windows and drew their curtains.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED BROADCASTER: (Speaking Hungarian).\n\nKAKISSIS: The Nazis eventually removed Horthy and replaced him with the openly fascist Arrow Cross regime. The anti-Semitism increased - with thousands of Jews being shot and their bodies dumped into the Danube. Today Hungarian nationalists blame all of the anti-Semitism on the puppet Arrow Cross regime. Hungary's current leader Viktor Orban has established the Veritas Institute to re-examine history. Its director Sandor Szakaly questions whether the Hungarians knew what was going to happen to the deported Jews.\n\nSANDOR SZAKALY: (Through interpreter) The question is, did the government know that the 437,000 deported after March 1944 would be deported to death camps? This is debatable.\n\nKAKISSIS: A new study from researchers at Yale University, Grinnell College and the European Union for Progressive Judaism shows Holocaust revisionism is rampant in central and Eastern Europe - with Hungary one of the worst offenders.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nKAKISSIS: Some of that revisionism is evident in an existing museum - the House of Terror, which was also conceived by Maria Schmidt. The very popular museum examines four decades of communist rule. Holocaust historian Lazslo Karsai takes me on a tour.\n\nLASZLO KARSAI: That is one of the old tanks. And those are all the victims.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKAKISSIS: We stop in a room about World War II. Karsai points out that the puppet Arrow Cross regime is blamed for killing Hungarian Jews, but there's no mention of the deportations that came before.\n\nKARSAI: And here you can see not a picture, not a word about this massive deportation - the biggest and fastest deportation action in the history of the Holocaust.\n\nKAKISSIS: This is why, Karsai says later in his office, Hungarian Jews are worried about what's going to go inside the new Holocaust Museum.\n\nKARSAI: Because if you speak about the Hungarian collaborators, if you speak about the participation of several hundreds of thousands of people in the persecution of the Hungarian Jews, you are an anti-Hungarian. The majority of the people do not want to hear about the Hungarian culpability - only Hungary as a victim.\n\nKAKISSIS: Hello, how are you?\n\nThe Hungarian government is trying to diffuse the conflict by giving management of the museum to Hasidic Jews who are part of a local organization affiliated with the Orthodox Chabad movement. It's led by Rabbi Shlomo Koves. He says no one going to the museum should be made to feel guilty.\n\nSHLOMO KOVES: I think that the point of opening Holocaust Museum is somehow to give a platform of digesting the past in a way where people can still look up to some of their ancestors and some of the good choices of their ancestors and to learn from it and to take the moral lessons that have - need to be taken.\n\nKAKISSIS: Chabad and Orban are allies with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nBut Chabad represents only a small fraction of the estimated 100,000 Jews who live in Hungary today. Most are in Budapest, home to Europe's largest synagogue.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken).\n\nKAKISSIS: Hi. Hello.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hi.\n\nKAKISSIS: Just around the corner from the synagogue is the headquarters of the Hungarian Federation of Jewish Communities, which represents most Jews here. Its director is Andras Heisler, the son of Holocaust survivor Rozsa Heisler, whom we met earlier.\n\nANDRAS HEISLER: We cannot make any compromise. We cannot accept any whitewashing. We cannot accept any change of the history because in the background there are our grandfathers, fathers and relatives and 600,000 killed Jews.\n\nKAKISSIS: But the government is pressing on - saying it hopes to open the House of Fates this spring on the 75th anniversary of when Hungarian Jews were deported to Auschwitz. For NPR News, I'm Joanna Kakissis in Budapest.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this story we incorrectly say that all Hungarian Jews deported to Nazi death camps in 1944 traveled through Jozsefvaros railway station in Budapest.

Governor Pulls National Guard From Border, Citing A 'Charade' At Federal Level\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Morgan Lee/AP Morgan Lee/AP\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has ordered the majority of National Guard troops deployed at her state's Southern border to withdraw, condemning what she called a \"charade of border fear-mongering\" by President Trump, who has warned of an immigration emergency in the region.\n\n\"I reject the federal contention that there exists an overwhelming national security crisis at the Southern border,\" Lujan Grisham said, adding that the area has \"some of the safest communities in the country.\"\n\nThe governor's order covers most of New Mexico's deployed troops, along with Guard members who have traveled from Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Wisconsin. In all, 118 National Guard troops have been deployed in New Mexico, the governor's office said.\n\nLujan Grisham ordered the withdrawal just before Trump delivered his State of the Union address, in which he railed against illegal immigration and labeled a group of mainly Central American migrants as \"illegal immigrants\" \u2014 despite the fact that most of them are traveling with legal humanitarian visas.\n\nThere had been speculation that Trump might use the State of the Union to declare a national emergency at the border, as a legal basis for going ahead with building his long-promised wall. The president did not mention that possibility during Tuesday night's speech.\n\nLujan Grisham rejected the idea that a national emergency exists along her state's border with Mexico. But she also said some troops will remain in southwestern New Mexico, saying they're needed to fulfill a humanitarian mission in Hidalgo County and neighboring counties.\n\nThose counties \"have seen large groups of families, women and children crossing over the border in the remote Antelope Wells area in recent months,\" the governor's office said.\n\nThe Antelope Wells port of entry is where 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, a migrant from Guatemala, went through an initial screening before dying of dehydration and shock in December. She was one of two migrant children who died in separate incidents in New Mexico that month, after being taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In the other case, Felipe Gomez Alonso, 8, died after being diagnosed with a cold and a fever.\n\nHidalgo County and its neighbors are asking for help \"as migrants and asylum-seekers continue to appear at their doorstep,\" Lujan Grisham said Tuesday.\n\nThe state's National Guard will now decide whether a larger presence is needed to support those counties. In addition, the state police will send six officers to bolster operations in Hidalgo County \u2014 a move that the governor's office says was requested by the county manager.\n\nNew Mexico sent National Guard troops to the border last April in an order from then-Gov. Susana Martinez that followed a White House proclamation. At least five states, including two led by Republicans, rejected the president's call to send troops, with Maryland's Gov. Larry Hogan saying his state wanted nothing to do with the Trump administration policy of separating families at the border.\n\nTrump began ordering Marines and other active-duty personnel to the border last fall. Earlier this week, he ordered an additional 3,750 troops to the Southern border, warning of \"Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country.\"\n\nThe active-duty service members are being sent to the area to perform duties such as hanging barbed wire and giving logistical support to Customs and Border Protection agents.\n\nIn addition to Lujan Grisham, other leaders along the border have said their communities are safe \u2014 and that there is no security emergency involving migrants. In its fact check of Trump's State of the Union speech, NPR's John Burnett and Carrie Kahn relayed these assessments:\n\n\"As for the 'state of our Southern border,' mayors along the Southwest border consistently say that their communities are among the safest in the nation. McAllen, Texas, Mayor Jim Darling asserted that his city is the third safest in Texas, according to FBI crime statistics, and seventh safest in the nation. 'Send social workers to process the asylum-seekers, not soldiers,' Darling said in a recent call with reporters. Eddie Trevino, Cameron County judge in Brownsville, added, 'It is a misconception that the border is insecure. There is no Central American invasion. This is a manufactured crisis.' \""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/06/691909951/alabama-officer-cleared-in-fatal-shooting", "text": "Alabama Officer Cleared In Fatal Shooting\n\nThe Alabama attorney general declared that a police officer who fatally shot a man in a mall on Thanksgiving was justified, though questions remain.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nAlabama's attorney general has declared that a Birmingham police officer who fatally shot a man in a mall on Thanksgiving Day was justified. But questions remain, even though officials say the investigation is complete. Sherrel Wheeler Stewart of member station WBHM has more.\n\nSHERREL WHEELER STEWART, BYLINE: A 24-page report from Attorney General Steve Marshall makes the case for shooting Emantic \"EJ\" Bradford Jr. in the Galleria. Police say officers responded to reports that someone had been shot, and they acted the way they were trained to when they saw Bradford running toward the victim with a gun. Here's the attorney general.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSTEVE MARSHALL: Mr. Bradford turned, aggressive stance, headed the direction of people that were unarmed. And the officer made the decision that taking action with his firearm was what was going to ensure the safety of those people there.\n\nWHEELER STEWART: Jenny Carroll is a law professor at the University of Alabama. She's followed the case and read the attorney general's report.\n\nJENNY CARROLL: What exactly was going on here such that the decision was made to kind of fire first, ask questions later? And it may be that after a conversation, you know, with the officers, people in the community would say, we agree this was a reasonable action.\n\nWHEELER STEWART: But she says because the attorney general determined the officer's actions were reasonable, that decision blocks any other potential judicial proceedings. Bradford's family members say he was trying to protect himself and his friend from a shooter. His friend survived after being shot by another man, now charged with attempted murder.\n\nProtesters demonstrated outside of the Hoover City Hall Tuesday evening over the decision to clear the officer.

But they can't resist pumping up the pep rally for their party and most loyal supporters.\n\nIf that applies to all presidents in all seasons, it surely applied Tuesday night to President Trump, who has found the halfway point of his term to be fraught with political travail.\n\nThe president's address had been delayed a week because of a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government, a shutdown for which polls showed he bore the burden of blame. His approval ratings in general had slumped in the new year, and a phalanx of investigations is moving inexorably forward in Congress as well as in the justice system.\n\nWhile he projected his usual triumphant bravado Tuesday night, Trump was also confronting for the first time a chamber of Congress controlled by the opposition. The newly enlarged ranks of House Democrats were quite visibly arrayed before him. Especially hard to miss were the scores of women among them wearing white to celebrate the centenary of Congress passing the constitutional amendment that empowered women to vote.\n\nThe president confronted this new challenge with a version of the familiar State of the Union strategy. He began with an appeal for unity, an appeal much foreshadowed by pre-speech White House briefings. He also praised America (\"We do the incredible, we defy the impossible ... Together we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history\"), recalled its heroics in space travel and World War II, pledged to eradicate HIV in a decade and announced new spending against childhood cancer.\n\nThe speech was so full of applause lines, emotional introductions of guests and exhortations of patriotism that it lasted nearly an hour and a half. It was even longer than last year's address, landing third on the all-time list for length (behind two of Bill Clinton's entries). At several points, the clapping and cheering segued into chants of \"USA! USA!\" from the Republican side of the chamber.\n\n(At another point, when the president acknowledged the record number of women elected to Congress in November, the Democratic side erupted in chants of \"USA! USA!\")\n\nUnderstandably enough, the president praised the soaring heights of the economic recovery, which has been peaking since he took office. He made a special point of citing the record low unemployment numbers for black and Hispanic workers.\n\nIn a similar vein, he celebrated passage of the First Step Act, a bipartisan effort at reforming the criminal justice system. He introduced the well-publicized Alice Johnson, who got out of jail last year under the new law after having her case brought to Trump's attention by Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nThe president also renewed his call for a paid version of the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, a favorite issue for his daughter Ivanka (as criminal justice reform was for her husband, Jared Kushner). The Step Act got far more attention than the Republican tax reform that took effect last year and rated just two sentences Tuesday night.\n\nThe last Congress also managed to pass bills attacking the opioid crisis, reordering the Department of Veterans Affairs and reauthorizing the nation's farm programs. If we could do those things together, Trump implied, anything was possible.\n\nThere could be a deal to restrain prescription drug prices, he said, or to restore the nation's aging infrastructure.\n\n\"Victory is not winning for our party,\" he said, \"victory is winning for our country.\"\n\nBut, like other presidents before him, Trump alternated his open-handed gesture with occasional hard jabs at the opposition.\n\nThe move away from peace and harmony came abruptly after the traditional declaration that \"the state of our union is strong.\" Trump pivoted to saying the \"only thing\" that could stop \"the economic miracle\" would be \"foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations.\"\n\nTo be sure, the new lineup of Democratic committee chairs has already begun probing a range of activities related to Trump and his administration. But the larger shadow over his White House is cast by the investigation led by former FBI chief Robert Mueller, who was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Both are lifelong Republicans.\n\nFrom that point on, the speech's primary emphasis was on the agenda the president himself wants to pursue \u2014 with or without the cooperation of the opposition. And no part of that agenda seemed to matter nearly so much as his vision for a wall with Mexico.\n\nMuch of the speech was devoted to depicting the Southern border as a threat to national security \u2014 a gateway for crime, drugs and illegal immigration. The talk of \"massive caravans\" sweeping northward was back from the days of the shutdown. Horrific crimes allegedly committed by members of MS-13 were detailed. Trump introduced a woman in the gallery whose parents were killed, he said, by an illegal immigrant.\n\nAs there has been little sign of movement on either side of the wall debate, it now seems likely the Feb. 15 deadline for a deal will not be met. Many expect that will trigger a presidential declaration of a national security emergency, which Trump says would enable him to build the wall with funds appropriated for other purposes.\n\nBut the wall was not the only gauntlet Trump tossed to the members of Congress. He also called for a new law limiting abortions late in a pregnancy, excoriating the New York Legislature for having \"cheered with delight the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from their mother's womb moments before birth.\"\n\nTrump also took a shot at embattled Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam for remarks he made in a radio interview about abortion late in a pregnancy. Northam is a physician.\n\nThe lurid descriptions recalled some of the language Trump had used in debating Hillary Clinton in the fall of 2016. And the president benefited from the connection that helped him back with white evangelical voters that November. No other social or cultural identifier is more likely to mark a Trump supporter in 2019.\n\nTrump reached out to these backers twice in discussing his foreign policy, talking about moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, the \"true capital\" of Israel. Later, he spoke of his pressure on Iran in terms of its importance as a threat to Israel. While support for Israel is a plus for many American Jews, it is also highly important to many evangelical Christians.\n\nOne other aspect of foreign policy did arise near the end of the speech. The president noted the power struggle in Venezuela and denounced the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, \"whose socialist policies have turned the richest country in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.\" Trump followed this with a vow: \"We are born free and we will stay free. Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\"\n\nThat provided a moment for TV cameras to seek out Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of whom call themselves democratic socialists. It also provided several applause lines that brought the Republican section to its feet, cheering and once again chanting \"USA! USA!\"\n\nBegun in sunny weather and smiles, the speech descended into a dark and stormy midsection. But the finish was full of rosy rays of sunset glory. The closing phrases were somewhere between the \"Pledge of Allegiance\" and the \"Lord's Prayer.\"\n\n\"And we must always keep faith with America's destiny, that one nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all nations of the world!\"\n\nShortly after the speech, the TV networks carried brief remarks by Stacey Abrams, who was giving the official response of the Democratic Party. Abrams, 45, lost a close race for governor in Georgia in November. She was the first African-American woman to give a party's official response to the SOTU, as well as the first person to do so who was not a federal official or statewide officeholder. She said the shutdown had been \"a stunt engineered by the president of the United States,\" but spent most of her time describing her own story and focusing on voting rights.\n\nAbrams shared responding duties with this year's Spanish-language responder, Xavier Becerra. A former congressman, Becerra is now the attorney general of California and plans to sue if Trump declares a national security emergency in pursuit of his wall."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/06/691872723/heres-how-trump-tried-to-win-women-over-in-his-state-of-the-union", "text": "Here's How Trump Tried To Win Women Over In His State Of The Union Address\n\nHide caption Democratic female lawmakers, dressed in white as a tribute to suffragettes, applaud at President Trump's State of the Union address.

And their white attire, in observation of the 100th anniversary of Congress voting to grant women the right to vote, highlighted their celebration even more.\n\nTrump seemed to have unintentionally given them the opening to gloat.\n\n\"You weren't supposed to do that,\" Trump jokingly told the women.\n\nAnd then the president went on to praise the women \u2014 this time, intentionally: \"Exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.\"\n\nTrump isn't known for applauding Democrats for much of anything. But here, he was applauding Democratic women, who are the reason for that new record. While the number of women in Congress smashed records after the 2018 elections, the number of Republican women fell.\n\n\"Congratulations; that's great,\" he said, as the women renewed their loud applause.\n\nJobs and electoral victories were a couple examples of a theme running through Trump's State of the Union address: outreach to women.\n\nBeyond job creation and electoral success, Trump announced an initiative to improve conditions for women in developing countries. He also touted the fact that a plan for paid family leave appeared in his budget.\n\nOn top of all that, women were central to Trump's message on immigration, his signature issue. The president stressed that many women attempting to cross into the U.S. illegally get sexually assaulted during the journey. In addition, Trump brought ICE agent Elvin Hernandez, who works to rescue women from sex traffickers, as one of his guests.\n\nThe pointed outreach to women may come in part from the president's awareness that a tough re-election fight is looming \u2014 and that getting re-elected might mean having to gain substantial ground with female voters.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nRepublicans already face a deficit with female voters, who preferred Democratic candidates in 2018 House races by 19 points, helping to create one of the largest gender gaps in that vote in decades. College-educated women in particular appear to be flocking to the Democratic Party. And women disapprove of the president far more than men do \u2014 the latest poll from CNN shows that women disapprove of Trump by a roughly 2-to-1 margin. Men, meanwhile, are evenly split. (Other recent polls show similarly large differences between men and women on the president.)\n\nA recent poll from The Washington Post and ABC News showed that on a variety of traits \u2014 whether the president is a \"strong leader,\" whether he has the right \"personality and temperament,\" whether he \"has brought needed change to Washington,\" whether he is \"good at making political deals\" \u2014 women are about 20 points less likely than men to view the president favorably. And on the question of how Trump has done on \"handling issues of special concern to women,\" 44 percent of men said \"excellent\" or \"good,\" compared with 23 percent of women.\n\nNational Failed Virginia Bill Sparks National Debate About Abortion Failed Virginia Bill Sparks National Debate About Abortion Listen \u00b7 3:23 3:23\n\nBut then, even while the president may have to win over some unconvinced voters in 2020, he also will have to hold onto his base. Abortion is an issue that excites many conservatives \u2014 especially white, self-described evangelicals \u2014 and in Tuesday's speech, Trump appealed to that demographic with sharp criticism of new, controversial abortion measures in Virginia and New York.\n\nHowever, that issue might also energize Democratic voters \u2014 women in particular \u2014 in 2020. It's true that there is little to no gender gap on whether abortion should be legal, as Pew found in 2018 polling. However, women are slightly more likely than men to say abortion is a \"critical issue\" to them, according to 2018 polling from the Public Religion Research Institute.\n\nIn addition, the issue is more important to other major Democratic constituencies \u2014 younger Democrats are more likely than younger Republicans to say abortion is important to them, and minority voters are more likely than white voters to say the same.\n\nAll of which means that to the extent Trump and other Republicans highlight reproductive rights in 2020, that could end up energizing Democratic-leaning demographic groups.\n\nIt's true that Trump won the election in 2016 with one of the largest gender gaps in modern history (notably, with far more support among white women than nonwhite women). But then the 2018 election showed that female voters were ready to put Democrats into office.

The officer \u2014 who was on duty at the mall \u2014 apparently mistook Bradford for Brown.\n\nAlabama Attorney General Steve Marshall released a 26-page report concluding that the officer was \"justified and not criminal\" in fatally shooting Bradford, \"who was running toward the initial shooter and victim with a firearm visibly in hand.\"\n\nThe report says, \"Officer 1's mistaken belief does not render his actions unreasonable.\"\n\n\"A reasonable person could have assumed that the only person with a gun who was running toward the victim of a shooting that occurred just three seconds earlier fired the shots,\" the report concludes.\n\nBradford's family reacted with outrage.\n\n\"My son was murdered. And you think I'm going to let it go?\" said Emantic Bradford Sr. as quoted by AL.com. \"That was a homicide ... you killed my son. You are a coward. You're a coward too, Steve Marshall.\"\n\n\"The police shot, we believe, because they feared a black man with a gun,\" said an attorney for the Bradford family, Ben Crump.\n\nThe police initially claimed that Bradford was a suspect in the mall shooting.\n\n\"But then the next day they said that Bradford likely was not the man involved in the original shooting and that set off waves of protest and unrest, said reporter GiGi Douban of NPR member station WBHM on All Things Considered.\n\n\"So you saw marchers demonstrating in front of the mayor's house, they stopped traffic on busy streets and interstates, and for a time they protested daily at stores across the area as the investigation dragged on with few details,\" Douban added.\n\nAttorney General Marshall also released two 13-second video clips from shopping mall surveillance cameras. One shows Bradford running and then falling as he is shot from behind three times. An autopsy showed that he was hit in the back of the head, neck and lower back.\n\nThe surveillance footage provided no sound, according to the report, which concludes that \"it is unclear\" if Officer 1 gave Bradford any verbal commands before shooting him. The officer reported that \"he did not give any commands due to the imminent nature of the threat,\" but two eyewitnesses said they heard such commands.\n\nNeither Officer 1, nor his partner, referred to as Officer 2, had turned on the body cameras they were wearing.\n\nMarshall's statement provides links to his report and the video."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/03/690523901/democrats-tap-leader-of-resistance-to-trump-for-spanish-state-of-the-union-respo", "text": "Democrats Tap Leader Of 'Resistance' To Trump For Spanish State Of The Union Response\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Stephen Lam/Getty Images Stephen Lam/Getty Images\n\nUpdated on Feb. 6 at 1:40 a.m. ET\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra \u2014 the son of immigrants, who has sued the Trump administration 45 times over a wide range of issues \u2014 will deliver the Spanish-language response to President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nBecerra was tapped by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., along with former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, who will give her response to Trump's speech in English.\n\nBecerra, 61, is well-known to Pelosi, who served with Becerra from the time he was elected to Congress in 1992 until he left to become attorney general in 2017. During his 24 years in the House, Becerra rose through the ranks to become chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, making him the highest-ranking Latino in Congress.\n\n\"Attorney General Becerra is a towering champion of equal justice and a tireless fighter for every American's right to quality, affordable health care, and we all look forward to his strong message of progress for all American families and communities,\" said Pelosi.\n\nIn a statement Becerra said, \"I'm looking forward to addressing my fellow Americans on a day when truth, candor and unity should be the order of the day. There is enough good going on in this country that we don't need to hide behind misrepresentations to describe the State of our Union.\"\n\nBecerra became California's first Latino attorney general when he was nominated by Gov. Jerry Brown to fill out the term of Attorney General Kamala Harris, after she was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016.\n\nBecerra was born in Sacramento, Calif., to immigrant parents from Mexico. The first in his family to attend college, Becerra earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Stanford University, where he also later received a law degree.\n\nIn an interview with KQED's Political Breakdown program in July 2018, Becerra said Trump's descriptions of Mexican immigrants as \"rapists and murderers\" reminded him of the kinds of treatment his parents had to endure.\n\n\"One thing that I've learned is that while my parents had to put up with some of these indignities, these injustices \u2014 my dad couldn't walk into a restaurant because of the signs that said 'No dogs or Mexicans allowed' even though he was a U.S. citizen \u2014 so when you hear someone like Donald Trump say those vile things you absorb, you remember, but then you try to move forward as best you can,\" Becerra said, adding that part of moving forward is learning to \"punch back.\"\n\nSince taking office in January 2017, Becerra has punched back in court dozens of times. On his own or in concert with other state attorneys general, Becerra has sued the Trump administration over the administration's travel ban on citizens of predominantly Muslim countries, threats to sanctuary jurisdictions protecting undocumented immigrants, clean air standards, women's access to reproductive health services and offshore oil drilling.\n\nPolitics California Attorney General On Challenging Trump Administration Policies California Attorney General On Challenging Trump Administration Policies Listen \u00b7 4:34 4:34\n\nIn doing so, he has helped cement California's image as leader of \"the resistance\" to the Trump administration. In November of last year, California voters overwhelmingly elected him to a full four-year term.\n\nBecerra is not the first to deliver a Spanish-language response to the State of the Union. That distinction goes to then-New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson in 2004.\n\nTwo other Florida lawmakers were subsequently chosen by Republicans to deliver a response in Spanish, Sen. Marco Rubio in 2013, followed by Ros-Lehtinen again in 2014, and Rep.

So it's like a treasure mountain. There are a lot of things used in people's daily lives.\"\n\nIesaki is digging on the site of the Jyokyo-ji temple, which belongs to the Pure Land sect of Buddhism. It was first built in 1449 and moved in 1591. The temple was demolished last summer to make room for a hotel that's due to open next June, just in time for the Olympics.\n\nBefore the hotel developers, part of the Mitsui Group conglomerate, began construction, they gave Iesaki about four months to excavate and salvage anything he found of historical value. Japanese law doesn't require developers to permit archaeological excavations before construction, but many do.\n\nIesaki says if the Jyokyo-ji temple hadn't been torn down, he wouldn't have had the chance to dig there. He and his team of a dozen people had to work fast, from September to January.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anthony Kuhn/NPR Anthony Kuhn/NPR\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anthony Kuhn/NPR Anthony Kuhn/NPR\n\n\"If I find something of value and more digging is needed, I might have to wait another 30 or 40 years, until there's a new construction project,\" he says.\n\nAcross Kyoto, archaeologists are rushing to uncover, document and preserve relics of the city's heritage as a pre-Olympic building boom sweeps the ancient former capital of Japan, changing its distinctive appearance and feel.\n\nThe number of visitors to Japan has nearly tripled in the past five years, to about 30 million last year. The largest contingent comes from mainland China. The city's infrastructure groans under the influx of tourists, and some residents chafe at the crowds. But with Japan rapidly aging and depopulating, it needs the tourists' money.\n\nTo accommodate tourism and business demands, some of the city's majestic temples and traditional wooden machiya town houses are coming down, and hotels and office buildings are springing up.\n\nNear City Hall, Tomomitu Umase is coordinating efforts to salvage cultural relics. A former archaeologist, Umase runs a city government department in charge of \"buried cultural treasures.\"\n\n\"Postwar Japan has made great advances in finding written historical records, as well as digging up ancient remains,\" he says. \"Development has allowed the excavation of relics. Then again, 99 percent of the artifacts have been destroyed because of development.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anthony Kuhn/NPR Anthony Kuhn/NPR\n\nOn the whole, Umase is gloomy about his city's building boom. Less development would mean more cultural artifacts could remain preserved underground for future generations to dig up, he says.\n\nOthers are more sanguine, including Koki Mitsuyama, a pragmatic 48-year-old Buddhist priest and former investment banker \u2014 and the owner of the demolished Jyokyo-ji temple. When we meet, he's dressed in a Japanese-style robe made of denim over a shirt and dark jeans.\n\nMitsuyama has been working with the developer to build a nine-story hotel, with the first floor divided between a lobby on one side and a new Jyokyo-ji temple on the other. Hotel profits will help fund the temple, and the hotel will even include a display area for the artifacts dug up by Iesaki and his team at the site.\n\nOwnership of temples in Japan is generally hereditary, and Mitsuyama was born into a temple family in Tokyo. His grandmother was raised in the Jyokyo-ji temple, and Mitsuyama was chosen to inherit it.\n\nBut the congregation of aging danka, or Buddhist parishioners, can no longer support the temple. The trend is mirrored across Japan, where by one estimate in 2015, more than 20,000 of the country's roughly 77,000 Buddhist temples no longer had priests.\n\nAt the same time, says Mitsuyama, people's relationships to temples are changing, as are their spiritual needs.\n\n\"Modern people care about getting benefits in this life, not the next,\" he observes. \"They want good things to happen to them today, tomorrow or next year, at the latest. They come to our temple to seeking inner peace and solace from problems of finances, family and mere survival.\"\n\nThe Pure Land sect makes spirituality simple, Mitsuyama says. Just by chanting the Buddha's name, he says, even sinners can make it to heaven \u2014 the Pure Land.\n\nBy linking it with the new hotel, Mitsuyama is confident he's putting the temple on a firm financial footing for the future. He hopes his solution will serve as an example and precedent for struggling Buddhist temples elsewhere in Japan.\n\n\"Changing people's ideas and coming up with new ways is part of the Pure Land sect's tradition of being original,\" he says. \"This is what I must do for the sect to help it prepare for the next century. And this is the right time to do it, so I have no hesitation.\"\n\nChie Kobayashi contributed to this story from Kyoto."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2019/02/06/685506578/is-beauty-in-the-eyes-of-the-colonizer", "text": "Is Beauty In The Eyes Of The Colonizer?\n\nEnlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\n\nQuick \u2014 think of the most beautiful person you know. Is it your partner? Your mother? Rihanna? (Wait, you know Rihanna? That's amazing!)\n\nThere are a million different reasons we find certain people beautiful. But there's no denying that a lot of current beauty standards in the U.S. are based on a particular type of beauty \u2014 one that centers a type of white femininity that's only accessible to a select few.\n\nSo this week on Ask Code Switch, we're answering a question from Cecilia Fernandez, of Ann Arbor, Mich. She tweeted at us to ask: \"Besides the natural hair movement, what other ways have women of color gone to decolonize their beauty routine?\"\n\nCecilia, this is a really great question. As someone who spent years flat-ironing my curls and suffering through orthodontia, I was also quite curious about this.\n\nSo to begin, let's talk about what it means when we say our notions of beauty are \"colonized.\"\n\nThink about why that person is beautiful. Is it because of their perfectly white teeth? Their thick, shiny hair? The fact that their features conform perfectly to Western beauty norms?\n\nTo begin with, a lot of current Western beauty standards celebrate whiteness \u2014 not some objective, biological, evolutionary thing, but literally just being a white person. In fact, if you go back and look at the work of some early racial theorists \u2014 people like Christoph Meiners and Johann Blumenbach \u2014 they defined the category of \"white,\" or \"Caucasian,\" as being the most beautiful of the races.\n\n\"It was important for [those racial theorists] to be superior in all areas,\" says Nell Irvin Painter, an artist and historian who wrote The History Of White People. She says the group of academics who first created these racial categories were white supremacists, so, \"they not only wanted the people they called 'their women' to be the most beautiful, and 'their men' to be the most virile. They wanted 'their countries' to have the best politics. So they wanted to have everything better. And that included beauty.\"\n\nThat association between beauty and whiteness has proved hard to shake. There's a reason that so many people still think of an \"all-American beauty\" as a thin, blonde, blue-eyed white woman. It wasn't until 1940 that the rules were changed to allow women of color to enter the Miss America pageant. Before that, the official rules stated that contestants had to be \"of good health and of the white race.\"\n\nDecisions about who society holds up as beautiful also have a lot to do with class. Nell Irvin Painter notes that a lot of the things we consider beautiful are actually just proxies for wealth. Think of how much it costs to get cosmetic surgery, or braces, or even a facial.\n\n(It's worth noting that there's a fair amount of overlap between beauty routines and health or grooming routines. People brush their teeth to prevent cavities, sure, but so many toothpastes also have whitening products. And you could be blowdrying your hair to get it dry, or to make sure it's shiny and voluminous. In this context, we're thinking of the purely aesthetic parts of a routine \u2014 not ones that have to do with health, functionality or hygiene.)\n\nSo, how do you push back against all that? A lot people talk about the importance of buying makeup or fashion designed by women of color. But throughout history, a lot of the most effective movements have been about expanding our ideas of what it means to be beautiful.\n\nLet's come back to the natural hair movement for a moment. That came out of the broader Black is Beautiful movement in the 1960s and '70s. That movement \u2014 which came in the midst of the broader Black Power and civil rights movements \u2014 was about affirming aspects of blackness that had been considered ugly by white, colonial standards. Organizers of the movement started to embrace the political power behind the idea that all aspects of blackness were beautiful.\n\nNell Painter says the movement had a huge effect on both her and her family. She says she didn't start to think of herself as beautiful until she was in her thirties, around the time \"black is beautiful\" sprung up. A similar thing happened to her mother, who was born in 1917:\n\n\"My mother was very beautiful. But my mother was dark-skinned, so she never thought of herself as beautiful. ... For black people, the idea of black as beautiful, that was a real breakthrough. And so my mother emerged as a beautiful person, and people told her she was beautiful, and it took her a long time to accept that. I don't know if she ever really did.\"\n\nThere are other movements that have tried to address beauty as a political force. There was the indigenismo movement in Mexico. One of its icons was the artist Frida Kahlo. In her self-portraits, she painted herself dressed in pre-Columbian clothes and hairstyles, with visible facial hair and hair between her eyebrows. Many have described those artistic choices as being a radical rejection of white, colonial beauty standards.\n\nAnd these days, a lot of women push back on the idea that they should remove facial and body hair in order to be considered beautiful or hygienic or professional. The activist and model Harnaam Kaur has spoken about how her life changed once she decided to stop shaving her beard: \"I feel a lot stronger and liberated to be who I am and accept who I am freely. ... I'm here as a woman who's wearing something that's supposed to be \u2014 in quotations \"supposed to be\" \u2014 a man's feature.\"\n\nThe body positivity movement and the fat-acceptance movements have also consistently pushed back on the idea that thin, young, white, able-bodied women are the epitome of beauty \u2014 or that beauty should be a precondition for respect to begin with.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that beauty is a facet of power. Being considered beautiful can help you gain access to certain spaces, or increase your power in certain settings. By the same token, a perceived lack of beauty, or a refusal or inability to conform to certain beauty standards, also has really tangible consequences.\n\nNoliwe Rooks is a professor at Cornell University who teaches about the politics of race and beauty. She says that women are placed in different categories depending on \"how they appear in the world,\" and that attempts to decolonize one's beauty routine often lead to pushback from the outside world \u2014 especially for black and brown people. She cited Hampton University in Virginia as an example. The historically black institution made news in 2012 for a policy in the business school that said male students couldn't have dreadlocks, because they were considered unprofessional.\n\nRooks says, \"If you're someone who feels like for body positivity and self affirmation, and adornment, this is what I'm going to do, 'I want dreadlocks' \u2014 yes you can do that. You can decolonize that look in the way that you feel is important to you. But you can't go to that school like it. ... Until recently you couldn't serve in the military. ... There's all manner of corporate jobs that if you're decolonizing your body you can't have.\"\n\nKeep in mind, Rooks says, that fighting against beauty norms is probably going to be really hard. Obese women, old women, queer women, women of color and all the intersections get particularly scrutinized, even when they're trying to conform to beauty norms \u2014 let alone when they push back against them. \"We can live in a world where we try to do battle with those overarching narratives,\" Rooks adds. \"But the forces pushing back against it in many parts of the world \u2014 it's quite a headwind.\"\n\nWhen we're talking about personal beauty, having a beauty routine at all means that you are, consciously or unconsciously, accepting the idea that you need to change. The way your hair falls or the shininess of your skin or the curl of your eyelashes \u2014 it will be more beautiful if you spend time and money to make it different.\n\nSo back to the question at hand: How do you decolonize the idea that your natural self isn't adequate?\n\nYou could argue that a profound way to decolonize your beauty routine would be to have none, and simply say, \"My body and face and are valuable and beautiful without modification.\"\n\nThe other really radical thing could be to try reject personal beauty as a measure of worth. Many have argued that beauty should not be a prerequisite, as it so often is, for being treated with respect, kindness or personal autonomy.\n\nAny way you go about it, the process of decolonizing your beauty routine is probably going to result in a lot of people being uncomfortable with your appearance. It's also the only way beauty norms have a chance of changing. So you have to know your politics. What are you trying to say with your beauty routine? And what ugly truths are you willing to deal with?\n\nDo you have thoughts/questions/feelings about race? Need some racial advice in your own life? We want to hear from you!

But the planet's magnetic north pole \u2014 the north that your compass points toward \u2014 wanders in the direction of Siberia at a rate of more than 34 miles per year.\n\nThat movement may seem slow, but it has forced scientists to update their model of Earth's magnetic field a year earlier than expected so that navigational services, including map-based phone apps, continue to work accurately.\n\nThe drift results from processes taking place at the center of the planet. Molten iron and nickel slosh and spin in the planet's core, essentially serving as a metallic conductor for Earth's magnetic field. Changes in that fluid flow lead to changes in the magnetic field.\n\nAs a result of those changes, the accuracy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's World Magnetic Model (WMM) \u2014 a mathematical representation of the magnetic field \u2014 slowly deteriorates in the five-year periods between updates.\n\nThe next update was due in 2020. But \"unplanned variations\" have degraded the quality of the WMM so greatly that NOAA published an out-of-cycle update Monday. It was delayed from January by the partial government shutdown.\n\nResearchers had known that the model was in trouble for about a year, Nature reports. Arnaud Chulliat, a geomagnetist for NOAA, spoke to a meeting of the American Geophysical Union last year about realizing how inaccurate the model had become.\n\n\"That was an interesting situation we found ourselves in,\" said Chulliat. \"What's happening?\"\n\nThe explanation was twofold, he said. The pole's continuous movement away from the Canadian Arctic was a problem for the model, as usual. Add in a 2016 geomagnetic pulse beneath South America that shifted the magnetic field, and you had a model too inaccurate to wait for next year's update.\n\nThe new version of the WMM should stay relatively accurate until the 2020 update comes out as planned.\n\nThe early release is good news for a wide array of federal, commercial and military services that rely on the model. Services like undersea navigation and air traffic management wouldn't function properly without an accurate model, according to NOAA.\n\nSmartphone maps count on magnetic sensors \u2014 and the WMM \u2014 to figure out the direction of magnetic north. (Think of how Apple and Google Maps show you which way you're facing as you turn a corner or rotate your phone.) And the U.S. Forest Service and NASA rely on the model as well.\n\nEarth's magnetic north pole has been moving toward Russia at least since the pole was discovered in 1831, according to NOAA. And rock sampling shows that Earth's magnetic field has been shifting for millions of years.\n\nMigratory animals, including birds, butterflies and whales, make use of the magnetic field for directions. Other animals can also sense the field, including cows, which tend to orient themselves toward a magnetic pole while grazing."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2018/06/22/622246815/unauthorized-immigration-in-three-graphs", "text": "3 Charts That Show What's Actually Happening Along The Southern Border\n\nThe total number of people apprehended for illegally crossing the southern U.S. border has been steadily falling for almost two decades. It's a long-term trend that sociologists, economists and federal officials have been tracking for years.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe trend apparently at odds with statements made this week by President Trump, the secretary of Homeland Security and the attorney general. They defended the administration's detention and prosecution policies by saying that the number of people crossing the southern border has increased.\n\nOfficials frequently refer to two numbers to illustrate the increase in unauthorized immigration. As Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a speech on Monday:\n\n\"Since this time last year, there has been a 325 percent increase in Unaccompanied Alien Children and a 435 percent increase in family units entering the country illegally.\"\n\nHowever, fiscal year 2017 was a very unusual one for illegal immigration. There was an enormous dip in the number of people apprehended at the southern border in the first part of last year compared with the previous four years, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Sociologists are studying the possible reasons for that dip, but the numbers are clear.\n\nLoading...\n\nA more telling month-to-month comparison would be between this May and May of 2014, at the peak of the most recent surge in people migrating from Central America. This May, Customs and Border Protection took 6,405 unaccompanied children into custody, compared with 10,578 children in May 2014. The trend was similar for families, with 9,485 apprehensions in May 2018, compared with 12,772 in May 2014.\n\nThere are some sub-groups of people who are consistently crossing the border in greater numbers in recent years. The largest group is people from Central America seeking asylum in the United States because of violence in their country of origin. As Nielsen noted, \"Over the last 10 years, there has been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims, resulting in an asylum backlog\" \u2014 from about 5,000 claims in 2007, up to more than 90,000 in 2016.\n\nWhat Is Asylum? Seeking asylum means asking the U.S. to accept you \u2014 legally \u2014 because of persecution you are facing in your home country. Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor; for a person who has already been deported once, it's a felony. Both types of crimes are currently being prosecuted with no exceptions, even if a person later requests asylum. Seeking asylum at a port of entry, however, is not a crime at all.\n\nThe increase in the number of people seeking asylum is part of a larger shift in the reasons people give for entering the U.S. at the southern border.\n\nFor many years, the best predictor of how many people would attempt to cross into the U.S. from Mexico was the strength of the American economy. When the economy was strong and unemployment was low, more people crossed the border. When the economy was weaker and unemployment was higher, fewer people were apprehended while crossing.\n\nA graph comparing border apprehensions with U.S. average unemployment shows how, between the early 1990s and the Great Recession, as one measure goes up, the other goes down.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut that trend has changed since the end of the recession, around 2009.\n\nAs NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reported last year:\n\n\"The number of unauthorized immigrants from other countries has been on the rise since the end of the recession, hitting an estimated 5.7 million in 2016. Immigrants from Central America and Asia \u2013 largely from India and China \u2014 are two of the main drivers of that growth. \"These demographics shifts within the unauthorized immigrant population mark a transition that began after the recession, according to Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at [the Pew Research Center]. \" 'A lot of Mexican unauthorized migration was related to family and friendship linkages between people in Mexico and immigrants in the U.S.,' he adds. But those connections may not be as strong as before, since fewer immigrants have been crossing the border.' \"\n\nFor that reason, Passel and others who study unauthorized immigration say they expect the number of Mexicans crossing the border to continue dropping.\n\nIt appears that the post-recession dip in migration started a trend that's now feeding itself. With fewer people crossing for work, fewer family members are seeking to follow.\n\n\"You have forever lost those networks that would have been formed had migration continued as usual,\" explains Pia Orrenius, a labor economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nStudies confirm that today, the strongest pull for people crossing the border without authorization is the desire to be with family in the U.S. Stepped-up border security may make it more difficult and dangerous for people to successfully cross the border, but research has found that criminalizing unauthorized entry into the U.S. does not deter those fleeing violence, and may only delay those seeking to reunite with family.\n\nAnd that means issues such as violence in Central America will likely become even more relevant drivers of unauthorized immigration, shaping who arrives at the U.S. border and how America responds."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/04/691311906/confronting-germanys-past-in-oscar-nominated-never-look-away", "text": "Confronting Germany's Past In Oscar-Nominated 'Never Look Away'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Caleb Deschanel/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics Caleb Deschanel/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics\n\nFilmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut film, The Lives of Others, won the Oscar for best foreign language film in 2006, bringing the enduring trauma of Germany's recent history to international attention.\n\nSet in East Berlin before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the film told the story of two artists who are monitored, surveilled and threatened by an East German intelligence officer. It was hailed as a groundbreaking film both abroad and in Germany for its blend of political history and cinematic drama.\n\nThe same themes of artistic freedom and historical trauma run through the director's new film, Never Look Away \u2014 which has also been nominated for the foreign language film Academy Award. Drawing on an even larger sweep of Germany's history, from the 1930s to the 1960s, it's a three-hour ode to the power of artists to heal the wounds of history.\n\nVon Donnersmarck based the central character in his film, a painter named Kurt, on the life of Germany's most celebrated postwar artist, Gerhard Richter. As von Donnersmarck explains, Richter's generation of artists helped shape the spirit of a country born from the ashes of total physical and psychological destruction.\n\n\"We cannot trust anything that has been done in the past because look at what the past led to,\" von Donnersmarck says. \"It led to this Nazi catastrophe. It led to human beings killing other human beings on a scale hitherto unimaginable. Let us not trust anything that comes from the past. Let us look at completely within and let us build a new, free art.\"\n\nIt was a period of innovation and inspiration that deeply inspired the filmmaker, who says he wanted to pay tribute to the artists who helped rebuild \"the country and the German psyche.\"\n\nThe movie opens in 1937 during the real-life Nazi-sponsored exhibition of \"degenerate art.\" Kurt's beloved aunt brings him to the exhibition, encouraging him to see what he is not supposed to see. She wants him to always think for himself \u2014 to never look away.\n\n\"It's an important sentence, and it accompanies our protagonist, the artist, through his whole life,\" von Donnersmarck says. \"And I think it's a very important thing to remember: Don't look toward things that you only find pleasant, you know. Look toward things that are disturbing, also.\"\n\nDarkness follows. Hitler ascends to absolute power. World War II begins. Kurt's aunt is institutionalized for mental illness and executed by the Nazis. Communism closes in. Through it all, Kurt never looks away.\n\nBut the film's lead actor, Tom Schilling, doesn't believe the film is intended to be an abstract and cerebral film about postwar modernism. He says the movie doesn't require a background in art because it's rooted in a universal coming-of-age story.\n\n\"His way of moviemaking is very close to the audience, somehow,\" Schilling says. \"He's able to create those goosebump moments, you know, those larger-than-life cinema moments.\"\n\nThe film's lush widescreen cinematography by Caleb Deschanel has also been nominated for an Oscar, and its soaring and ever present score is by the British composer Max Richter. From the fields of East Germany, the film moves to the lecture halls and studios of West Germany's leading postwar art academy in Duesseldorf, filled with scenes of how Kurt finds his tribe of artists, falls in love and eventually confronts his family's trauma on canvas.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Caleb Deschanel/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics Caleb Deschanel/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics\n\nActor Sebastian Koch, who also starred in The Lives of Others, plays Kurt's stern father-in-law, a gynecologist with a dark past as a murderous SS officer. He says von Donnersmarck's filmmaking is a welcome reprieve from traditionally austere and detached German films.\n\n\"In Germany we are not very emotional, so it's always like everything is explained,\" Koch says. \"The screen has the opportunity to hide things and to explain it in a different way. And Florian \u2014 he just has no fear about emotions. He uses the screen to transport these deep emotions, and that's quite rare in Germany.\"\n\nJournalist and translator Anna Altman wrote about Never Look Away for The New Republic following the film's German release last year. She explains that the film follows in a storied postwar cultural tradition known as Vergangenheitsbewaltigung.\n\n\"It's a word that means grappling with the past as it relates to the World War II period,\" Altman says. \"There's a very clear drive in Germany to talk about the stories of the past and to tease out the particulars of what happened and also to be willing to say that as a country they'd erred and failed \u2014 and done much worse than failed \u2014 and it's something that has to be expressed to move beyond it.\"\n\nBut the complexity of that kind of historical reckoning and expression is precisely why many German critics have taken issue with Never Look Away. Berlin-based film critic and radio host Patrick Wellinski says many of his colleagues felt the film oversimplified and Hollywood-ized too many nuances of political history for cinematic value.\n\n\"German audiences and critics are more sensitive if it comes to these historical topics, and they should be,\" Wellinski says.\n\nOne dramatic montage sequence in particular stirred debate across German newspapers.\n\n\"It's the moment where he enters a morally aesthetic taboo for German critics,\" Wellinski says. \"He goes into the gas chamber with his camera. And he shows, in a parallel montage, the bombing of Dresden. And there is a question of the victim status. You can't say that a falling Wehrmacht soldier has the same victim status [as] a woman who goes into the gas chamber. And he puts all of this with ... Handel music, which is really disgusting.\"\n\nWellinski, who definitely did not like the film, notes that Richter has also publicly distanced himself from it.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bilal Qureshi/NPR Bilal Qureshi/NPR\n\nBut von Donnersmarck, who both wrote and directed the movie, says he welcomes the debate because he believes audiences must confront the lessons of history, no matter how painful and messy those conversations may be.\n\n\"When I see big mistakes happening in society, especially in politics, I often think there should be such a thing as an obligatory history exam for anybody who wants to run for public office so that we are really sure that they've occupied themselves with the mistakes of the past so as not to be condemned to repeat them,\" von Donnersmarck says.\n\nVon Donnersmarck says above all, with Never Look Away he wants to remind audiences why art still matters and how it can heal the most painful wounds.\n\n\"Art shows you \u2014 any form of creative expression shows you \u2014 that every little last thing you did in your life, whether it be because of your own weakness or frailty or because of things people did to you or because of ever feeling lost or lonely or whatever it is: All those things are absolutely necessary for the creation and expression that you have found,\" von Donnersmarck says.\n\n\"If we really accept the hurt that's happened to us, it will be our greatest treasure,\" he adds.\n\nTom Cole edited this story for broadcast."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/04/691261262/last-4-children-detained-on-nauru-are-heading-to-the-u-s", "text": "Last 4 Children Detained On Nauru Are Heading To The U.S.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jason Oxenham/AP Jason Oxenham/AP\n\nUpdated at 5:08 p.m. ET\n\nAustralia says the last four asylum-seeking children held in its detention centers on the island nation of Nauru are to be transferred to the United States.\n\nThe country has faced years of criticism from human rights advocates over the health of asylum-seekers and the condition of detention facilities on the island. Amnesty International and other groups have described a mental health crisis where self-harm is common.\n\nNauru The tiny island nation is just 8 square miles and has only 10,000 citizens.\n\nThe transfer is part of a deal between Australia and the U.S., under the Obama administration, in which the U.S. agreed to accept some 1,250 refugees. Less than a month after President Trump took office, he blasted the agreement as a \"dumb deal\" \u2014 nevertheless, refugees started to be transferred to the U.S. in September 2017.\n\n\"Refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea continue to arrive in the United States,\" a State Department spokesperson told NPR. \"Nearly 500 refugees from these locations have been resettled to date. These refugees have been subject to the same stringent vetting procedures as other refugees from around the world.\"\n\nThe spokesperson did not provide specific information about Australia's statement that these four children are scheduled for transfer.\n\nThe Australian government implemented a stricter border policy in 2013, the centerpiece of which is \"No-one who travels illegally to Australia by boat will be allowed to remain in Australia.\"\n\nAfter that, Australian authorities routinely began to intercept asylum-seekers and bring them to detention facilities on Nauru or to a detention center on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, where single men are held. They would then be detained there indefinitely.\n\n\"With the last four children booked to leave for the US, every asylum seeker child will now be off Nauru,\" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Twitter. \"Our strong border protection policies have enabled us to secure our borders, stop the boats and the tragic drownings at sea while getting children out of detention and off Nauru without putting our stronger borders at risk. We have got the balance right.\"\n\nMorrison, leader of Australia's Liberal Party, became prime minister last August. He said in a statement that there were 109 asylum-seeker children on the island when he took office and that his government has been working \"quietly and methodically through this process.\"\n\nLocal advocates from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre also said that \"all of the critically sick children detained by the Australian government on Nauru were now receiving the medical care they need in Australia.\"\n\nThey say it has been a long road. \"In public the Government will call this a win and boast about evacuating this last child for urgent medical care but behind the scenes we have had to fight in the courts or threaten legal action to evacuate every single one of these sick children and their families,\" David Burke, senior lawyer with the Human Rights Law Centre, said in a statement.\n\nThe ASRC said in August that nearly 30 percent of the remaining children were suffering from symptoms of \"Traumatic Withdrawal Syndrome.\"\n\n\"It is most commonly seen in children and young adolescents, and has the clinical features dramatic social withdrawal, with severe reduction or inability to walk, talk, eat, and drink, self-care or socialise,\" it said.\n\nIt added: \"These children cannot recover on Nauru because ... Nauru is the cause of their trauma.\"\n\nWhile there will soon be no more children in the centers, Reuters reports that an estimated 1,000 people remain held."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/04/691221543/how-venezuela-arrived-at-its-political-crisis", "text": "How Venezuela Arrived At Its Political Crisis\n\nSteve Inskeep talks to historian Miguel Tinker Salas, a Latin American studies professor at Pomona College in California, about the broader context of the political crisis developing in Venezuela.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro insists he's not going anywhere. He remains in place even though European nations have recognized an opposition leader as president and protesters flooded the streets over the weekend.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Si, se puede. Si, se puede.\n\nINSKEEP: Si, se puede, they're saying - \"yes, it's possible\" or \"yes, we can.\" But Maduro supporters were marching, too, marking the 20th anniversary of Venezuela's socialist government. That government's rise to power is the backdrop for this moment. It came to power with a 1999 election of Maduro's populist predecessor Hugo Chavez. A specialist on Latin America, Miguel Tinker Salas of Pomona College, followed Chavez's career.\n\nMIGUEL TINKER SALAS: For the first time, you had a leader in Venezuela that looked like the mixed-race population, that spoke like them, acted like them. And he was able to utilize much of that to, again, promote social programs and to be re-elected on multiple occasions.\n\nINSKEEP: So this populist guy, Hugo Chavez, tries a coup, fails - but ends up winning an election, taking power - huge media figure, on television all the time, dominating everybody's lives and says he's going to change everything. How did he change things in the last years of his life?\n\nTINKER SALAS: The first was political reform, the constitution of 1999, which is today being promoted by the opposition, which at that time they opposed. Then there was a coup in 2002. He came back. And then we had dramatic investment in social programs - health care, education, housing. But that could only happen as long as oil prices were exceedingly high. And eventually, as prices declined, there would be a reckoning. And that reckoning has happened.\n\nINSKEEP: At what point did it become apparent that, amid all of this spending, that the oil money was starting to run out.\n\nTINKER SALAS: As the prices after 2014, 2015 begin to decline, Chavez has died. You begin to have shortages of basic food products, long lines. You have the U.S. sanctions, mismanagement, corruption. There are several factors.\n\nINSKEEP: And I guess it was in this period that Chavez's party began losing elections, that his successor, Nicolas Maduro, his party tried to keep control of the legislature and totally lost. Right?\n\nTINKER SALAS: Correct. It's the very first electoral victory the opposition scores in the National Assembly.\n\nINSKEEP: So they won the legislative elections, but then Maduro's government completely disempowered the legislature. Right?\n\nTINKER SALAS: Right. Maduro increasingly relies on what he will call the National Constituent Assembly (ph), which is this clause in the constitution which he activated to create a alternative body.\n\nINSKEEP: So wait a minute. Maduro is clearly losing power from 2015 onward. And instead of just fighting it out in elections, he ends up taking all the power away from the National Assembly, winning re-election with deeply disputed methods. How much popularity, though, does the president still seem to have, if any?\n\nTINKER SALAS: According to some polls - even opposition polls - anywhere from 25 to 30 percent, even with the current crisis. And the opposition to Maduro is not just from the right. There are people protesting against Maduro that are protesting because he has not fulfilled the promises he made to the popular sectors. The opposition, they are united in ousting Maduro. It's not clear that they are united on what comes next.\n\nINSKEEP: The opposition leader Juan Guaido has said he's president under this provision that says that the legislative leader becomes interim president if there's a vacancy of the presidency. But isn't he limited to holding that office for 30 days until he can figure out an election?\n\nTINKER SALAS: Yes. And this is where it becomes kind of problematic because the constitution says 30 days. I'm hearing already from opposition sources saying that maybe they need a year to cleanse the political process. That would lead to more chaos. And that's the fear of playing to the military. What happens if you do find a faction in the military and we do wind up with an open military conflict? The consequences would be disastrous for the country.\n\nINSKEEP: Is the opposition movement discredited at all because it has such overt support from the United States?\n\nTINKER SALAS: For an important segment of Venezuelan society, it is. The fact that you have Donald Trump, whose actions in terms of Latin America vis-a-vis the border, immigrant families, the separation of children. And then you have John Bolton and statements about the oil company. That baggage is part of what Guaido now carries.\n\nINSKEEP: Even with that said, does it seem to you that the opposition is legitimate on some level, that they represent the broad majority of society?\n\nTINKER SALAS: I think the opposition is a legitimate force in Venezuela. I think that they not always have been Democratic. We have to go back, understand that in 2002, they supported a coup. The reality is that unless there is a negotiated solution, unless the parties can come together, it puts us back at square one tomorrow.\n\nINSKEEP: Miguel Tinker Salas, thanks very much.\n\nTINKER SALAS: Thank you very much.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: We incorrectly say Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was elected president of Venezuela in 1999.

James Ungalaq talks to NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro about his band's new album and their the music lives on.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nOn a week when some Americans experience bitterly cold temperatures, perhaps it's appropriate we spend some time with a band that knows all about life subzero, Northern Haze.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SINNAKTUQ\")\n\nNORTHERN HAZE: (Singing in Inuktitut).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Northern Haze is from Igloolik. That's a village in Nunavut, the northernmost territory of Canada. In 1985, they made a name for themselves with this debut album, said to be the first indigenous-language rock album recorded in North America. The group lost its bass player to cancer in 2007, followed just days later by tragedy when another player was murdered. Now, 30 years later, they have a new album. It's called \"Siqinnaarut,\" meaning return of the sun.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"INUK\")\n\nNORTHERN HAZE: (Vocalizing, singing in Inuktitut).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Northern Haze bandleader James Ungalaq joins us from the studios of the CBC in Nunavut. Welcome to the program.\n\nJAMES UNGALAQ: Thank you very much, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So first of all, the title of the album, \"Return Of The Sun\" - I can imagine that up there, when the sun returns, it's a big deal.\n\nUNGALAQ: Yes, it is. It starts to get bright again. People see more of the landscape. It's beautiful during that time.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It's been 30 years since you were able to make an album. And so I guess the return of the sun is also the return of you to the spotlight.\n\nUNGALAQ: That's it. We had the idea go around amongst us for a while. And it was a perfect time for our new album.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Why did it take so long, these 30 years?\n\nUNGALAQ: We've been playing music all along in our shed and our houses, John's living room and Derek's porch.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Your band members.\n\nUNGALAQ: We've been playing music all the time. We just haven't come out in the open. Finally everything just connected together so well. And we had an opportunity to put out an album. So there it is.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to take you back to a painful time, which is 2007. How did you and your band members cope with the loss of two players?\n\nUNGALAQ: Oh, boy. We played a lot of tunes. We cried a lot. And after crying, we started to get happy again, you know, and get over the grievance.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF NORTHERN HAZE SONG, \"ANGAJUSAKULUK\")\n\nUNGALAQ: Music is wonderful. It's a medicine. It's - I don't know how. But music, it helped us cope with all our troubles.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: There's a song on the album dedicated to your bass player, Elijah, who died from cancer. Let's listen to a bit of that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ANGAJUSAKULUK\")\n\nNORTHERN HAZE: (Singing in Inuktitut).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: What does the title mean?\n\nUNGALAQ: It means brother, older brother, step-older-brother, to be exact. We wrote that song to help him fight his battles to show him we're with him during his struggles, and he's not forgotten. After he passed, it helped us cope.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"INUUSIVUT II\")\n\nNORTHERN HAZE: (Singing in Inuktitut).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Speaking of family, your son Derek now plays bass in the band. And we hear him sing on the album. What was it like to bring your son into the Northern Haze band? Are you passing the torch?\n\nUNGALAQ: I don't know if I'm passing the torch, but he certainly stole a lot of the show. He's very talented, for sure.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I understand in these 30 years that you haven't made an album you actually make a living seal and narwhal hunting. Do you and your son spend time hunting together?\n\nUNGALAQ: As much as we could - yeah. That's what I want to do more when I get home. I mean, we're regular Canadian Eskimo in Igloolik and just have our guitars and get together and have fun - what I love about my small community, isolated and frozen.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Isolated and frozen - let's listen to another track on the album. The liner notes say this is inspired by the band Boston.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF NORTHERN HAZE SONG, \"IRAQ\")\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: People may recognize the riffs from Boston's \"Peace Of Mind\" in that one.\n\nUNGALAQ: Yes.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Did you and your bandmates listen to a lot of American rock growing up?\n\nUNGALAQ: Yes, we did. We listened to Jimi Hendrix and Thin Lizzy and Pink Floyd and Dire Straits and all those guitar players, you know?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IRAQ\")\n\nNORTHERN HAZE: (Singing in Inuktitut).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Many native communities have gravitated towards hard rock. What is it about that genre that is so appealing?\n\nUNGALAQ: I don't know. I think, like, young people - everybody loved Elvis or Beatles, you know? I don't know what makes us love rock 'n' roll, you know, in the North in isolated places. I think it's raw.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED NORTHERN HAZE MEMBER: We like anything raw.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I can hear your bandmates in the background. You like anything raw.\n\nUNGALAQ: The poetry and the music message, you know? - all those things together, I guess.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF NORTHERN HAZE SONG, \"QAINNA\")\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: James Ungalaq from the band Northern Haze, thank you so very much.\n\nUNGALAQ: (Speaking Inuktitut).

Some turned their faces away to avoid the sight of women rattling past on bikes. Others gaped.\n\nA nearby samosa seller, Saqlain Usman, 18, shook his head. His three sisters wouldn't dream of undertaking such an offensive act. They stayed home, he said, where they belonged.\n\n\"They fear their daughters will copy the riders,\" said Zulekha Dawood, 26, the woman's biking group organizer, who works to organize activities for Lyari's Girls Cafe, a community center. \"Their fears are real. When we began, we had very few girls \u2014 maybe seven or eight. Now we have an entire group \u2014 30 girls.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Diaa Hadid/NPR Diaa Hadid/NPR\n\nDawood started this weekly ride in February 2018. She had previously run a girls boxing club and saw some boys on bikes nearby. \"If they can ride,\" Dawood thought, \"why shouldn't we?\"\n\nIt is a rare endeavor in conservative Pakistan, where few women dare to cycle. It is seen as a vulgar and sexlike act because a woman must straddle a seat.\n\nThe initiative echoes other pop-up efforts across South Asia and the Middle East. Some are inspired by a book by Indian feminists called Why Loiter? Women and Risk on Mumbai Streets. It discusses how in these parts of the world, a woman in a public space without a purpose \u2014 like going to the market or to school \u2014 is viewed as a threat to public morality, said Nida Kirmani, an associate professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, who has written about Lyari's Girls Cafe.\n\n\"They certainly can't be hanging out just for fun,\" Kirmani said. Unlike men, women aren't welcome to sit at tea stalls, hang out with their girlfriends at a park or ride a bike for fun. The book Why Loiter? \"advocates for women being in public spaces with no purpose,\" she said, \"as a kind of feminist-political act.\"\n\nFrom the start, the Pakistani bicyclists have faced pushback. On their first ride, Dawood says, the girls were accosted by male madrassa students.\n\n\"They were kicking the girls,\" she recalled, and she heard them shout, \"Why don't your brothers stop you? Cover yourself and go pray! Go home!\"\n\nOne cleric, who runs a large Islamic seminary that was not involved in the violence, said that women riding bikes is a provocative act. \"Is it necessary that they exhibit themselves among the men?\" asked Mullah Muhammad Naeem. He said that such public riding leads \"to moral corruption\" and suggested that women ride behind high walls, unseen by men.\n\nIn fact, Dawood created a route away from the madrassa, fearing for the safety of the girls riding with her.\n\nHer group of bikers is more remarkable because it is run by working-class women from Lyari. Similar efforts across Pakistan have been dominated by wealthier women in leafy, more liberal suburbs. They face tighter constraints than wealthier women.\n\n\"When we first started cycling, people said, 'This is Lyari, not Defence,' \" Dawood says, referring to an upscale Karachi neighborhood. Regardless of where a woman lives, she has a right to move freely, Dawood says. \"This is empowerment. We feel good. We feel free. We can go anywhere.\"\n\nDuring that Sunday ride in December, Dawood guided some two dozen women and girls, most of them wearing headscarves, on red bikes out of the cafe's storeroom. They rode single file past boys playing in a narrow alley. Families sleeping on the pavement waved at the group, whose members rode lightly to avoid splashing through a pool of sewage. They reached a pedestrian area where other women were waiting for a riding lesson.\n\nAyesha Abbas, 14, wobbled through a line of orange cones that Dawood set up for practice riding. \"I'm afraid I'll fall,\" Ayesha said. Her helmet was unsteadily perched; like other riders, she had removed her face veil to see clearly. She had already made progress, she boasted \u2014 \"I can keep my feet on the pedals!\"\n\nHer friend, Hasiba Abdul Sattar, 14, kept her steady. \"I'm teaching her,\" she said. Hasiba learned to ride only the previous Sunday. \"I'm not perfect,\" she admitted. Her instructions were sometimes perplexing: \"Put your feet on the pedals \u2014 then try walk.\"\n\nNaila Naz, 19, a college student, surrendered her bike to another woman who wanted to practice. Riding was part of her battle for women's equality, Naz said, which included \"the right to go anywhere.\" And it suited a working-class woman. \"We are common persons \u2014 we don't own the car \u2014 so we are starting from the cycle.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Diaa Hadid/NPR Diaa Hadid/NPR\n\nLike many of the female riders, Naz credited her father for inspiring her independence. \"Don't ask permission,\" she recalled him saying. \"You have every right to be what you want.\"\n\nHe was a rickshaw driver who died at 45 after a sudden illness \u2014 the family couldn't afford treatment. Now Naz lives with her relatives in Karachi. They probably wouldn't approve of her bike-riding. \"I don't care,\" Naz shrugs. \"I am my own person.\"\n\nOthers were less defiant. Urooj Bisma, 12, all elbows and knees, often led the group. But she said most riders would probably feel pressure to quit as they reached marriageable age; otherwise their parents would struggle to find them a match. Already, she said, \"the social pressure \u2014 when I think of what people will say \u2014 that also haunts me.\"\n\nShe hopes to resist pressure as long as possible \u2014 she loves riding and setting an example: \"When girls see us and are inspired, it really gives me immense pleasure. I want other girls to shed their fears and ride a bike.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/01/690024261/welcoming-girls-of-all-ages-boy-scouts-of-america-is-now-scouts-bsa", "text": "Welcoming Girls, Boy Scouts Program Is Now Scouts BSA\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katie Blackley/WESA Katie Blackley/WESA\n\nOn a recent morning at the Laurel Highlands Council headquarters in downtown Pittsburgh, 12-year-old Elly Riegner rummaged through containers of small, circular patches.

She said she's glad girls can take advantage of the 109-year-old program.\n\n\"I was just like, 'that's awesome,'\" she said. \"I was the kid who wanted to be a Boy Scout and my daughter kind of missed out on all of that and I wanted to give her an opportunity to do the things that I know she really likes.\"\n\nThat includes hiking, canoeing and fishing \u2014 although Abby said she doesn't like taking the fish off the hook. She said she thinks her daughter will enjoy cooking the most. Elly attended a day camp with the Webelos last year and loved making an omelet over the campfire.\n\nThe new older girls' troop will be modeled on the boys', combining the two groups for things like opening pledges and announcements. But the majority of activities and outings will be separate. Abby said because the idea is so new, they'll be adjusting as they go.\n\n\"We're going to share events, share equipment,\" she said. \"Then they have some established service projects and we're going to kind of branch off and find out what the girls are interested in doing.\"\n\nLaurel Highlands Council Scouting Executive and CEO Sharon Moulds said the most common question is whether these older scouts troops will be co-ed.\n\n\"There are girl troops and there are boy troops,\" Moulds said. \"Generally what people are concerned about is they think they're going to merge together ... that's never going to happen.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katie Blackley/WESA Katie Blackley/WESA\n\nIt's important for the development of young men and women to have separate troops, Moulds said, especially in their early teenage years when they're learning leadership skills.\n\nThere has been criticism from Girl Scouts USA, who sued the Boy Scouts last year over their proposed name change. Moulds said Scouts BSA isn't discouraging girls from joining the Girl Scouts, which, according to the organization, have about 2.6 million members worldwide. Within Boy Scouts, there was also some early resistance to allowing girls, but Moulds said most members have come around.\n\n\"It's kind of a mix because we have some ... grandfathers, and they're saying, 'Oh, I can get my granddaughter in,'\" she said. \"They absolutely want their granddaughters to have the same opportunities.\"\n\nThe decision to invite girls into Boy Scouts was not an easy one, Moulds said. Families told the organization it would be more convenient for their increasingly busy schedules to drop their children off at one meeting, instead of driving to multiple events and activities. Ahead of the February change, Moulds said girls are already telling her they're looking forward to being involved.\n\n\"They're excited about having the opportunity to do what they've seen their brothers do or the other boys do,\" Moulds said. \"I think a lot of them, what we're seeing is that they just want to be Eagle Scouts.\"\n\nThat's the case for Elly Riegner. With her first day as a scout coming up, she's been reading up on the ranks and practicing her salutes."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/01/689937545/u-s-added-304-000-jobs-in-january-shutdown-boosts-unemployment-to-4-0-percent", "text": "U.S. Added 304,000 Jobs In January; Shutdown Boosted Unemployment To 4 Percent\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 9:27 a.m. ET\n\nJob growth picked up for the 100th consecutive month in January even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed during the partial government shutdown, the Labor Department said Friday.\n\nEmployers added 304,000 jobs last month \u2014 topping analysts' expectations and the 223,000 average monthly gain in 2018.

That was less than the blockbuster 312,000 first reported, and it followed the revised 176,000 jobs added in November.\n\nGains occurred in a number of sectors: Leisure and hospitality added 74,000 jobs, construction 52,000, health care 42,000, retail nearly 21,000 and manufacturing 13,000.\n\nWage growth held steady in January. Average hourly earnings grew 3.2 percent over the past 12 months \u2014 matching December's increase. Workers earned an average of $27.56 an hour last month.\n\nThe 35-day partial government shutdown, which ended Jan. 25, affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors. But because of a bill signed into law by President Trump on Jan. 16, federal employees who were furloughed or required to work without pay were guaranteed back pay after the shutdown ended. Those workers were counted as employed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n\nStill, the Labor Department said that the number of people employed part time who wanted to work full time jumped by about 500,000, to 5.1 million, in January. \"Nearly all of this increase occurred in the private sector and may reflect the impact of the partial federal government shutdown,\" it said.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the shutdown will cut economic growth by 0.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2019, although some of that will be recouped later in the year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, which keeps a close eye on the employment numbers, said Wednesday that the labor market has continued to strengthen since December. The central bank, which raised rates four times last year, did not raise rates and cited \"global economic and financial developments\" and low U.S. inflation as reasons to be patient before changing rates again.\n\n\"The respectable employment data provides something of a relief, for now at least, for members of the Federal Reserve who have been bracing for the possibility of a more serious slowdown in the U.S. economy,\" said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/28/689237309/census-bureau-conducts-massive-recruiting-effort-for-2020-head-count", "text": "The Census Bureau Needs To Hire Half A Million Workers For The 2020 Count\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Toby Talbot/AP Toby Talbot/AP\n\nWhile hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed during the partial government shutdown, one federal agency was in the midst of a massive recruiting effort.\n\nThe Census Bureau has been busy trying to hire around a half million temporary workers to help carry out the upcoming national head count of every person living in the U.S. The census is set to officially kick off next January.\n\nFunding carried over from last year kept census preparations going through the 35-day shutdown that ended Jan. 25. That includes processing applications received through the bureau's 2020 census jobs website that launched last September and staffing up census offices that are starting to open this month in communities around the country.\n\n\"The one thing that keeps me up at night is the one thing I have less control over, and that's our ability to recruit and hire,\" the Census Bureau's head of the 2020 census, Albert Fontenot, explained during a public meeting last year.\n\nCensus workers will play a critical role to make sure people who don't fill out a census form themselves by mail, phone or online get counted. Fewer than seven in 10 householders plan to take part in the census, according to a new report commissioned by the Census Bureau.\n\n\"The rate is cause for concern because the decennial census is designed to count every person in the United States,\" wrote the report's researchers, noting that the actual response rate may be lower.\n\nA small applicant pool?\n\nDoor-to-door follow-up visits by census workers help make up the most expensive part of the 2020 census. The head count is expected to cost a total of $15.6 billion. But the visits have helped the agency ensure that as many residents in the U.S. as possible are counted accurately and at their usual addresses.\n\nThe low unemployment rate, however, could result in an applicant pool smaller than the bureau would like for its openings for door knockers and other census positions.\n\nAn earlier round of hiring beginning in 2016 for partnership specialists \u2014 charged with encouraging the hardest-to-count groups, including communities of color, to participate in the census \u2014 encountered \"smaller than expected applicant pools, declined offers, and turnover,\" according to a Government Accountability Office report released last year.\n\nFor last year's test run of the 2020 census in Rhode Island's Providence County, the bureau sent out into the field about 70 percent of the workers it planned to bring on.\n\nUsing smartphones to submit people's census information back to the bureau through the Internet did help boost the workers' productivity for the test run in Providence County. Still, Census Bureau officials say they plan to adapt their recruiting efforts for the actual head count.\n\nOnly hiring U.S. citizens?\n\nMore than 90,000 people have applied for 2020 census jobs through the bureau's website, and since late December, the agency has hired more than 680 workers. The bureau is expected to make a more high-profile push for job applicants through an advertising campaign set to launch in January 2020.\n\nCensus job postings have noted that U.S. citizenship is a requirement, as it is for most federal government positions. For past head counts, however, the Census Bureau has received exemptions to hire noncitizens with special language or cultural skills to serve as translators and in outreach positions.\n\n\"There is not a ban\" on hiring noncitizens, the Census Bureau's public information office emphasized in a written statement from June. In a new statement, the agency says it's \"still pursuing all legal flexibilities provided by Congress to hire the workforce we will need to conduct an accurate 2020 Census.\"\n\nSo far, however, the bureau has only hired U.S. citizens for the upcoming head count.\n\n\"Bridge job\"\n\nSome communities are doing their part in recruiting efforts by helping job seekers apply for census jobs. For now, many of the openings are for outreach specialists who work with local community groups, as well as for positions based in local and regional census offices.\n\nMarzena Ermler, the career services manager at the New York Public Library, says she has been recommending census positions as a \"bridge job\" for some job seekers.\n\n\"We very often see a lot of mature job seekers who are transitioning from one career to another,\" explains Ermler, who is based at the Science, Industry and Business Library in Manhattan. \"They, for whatever reason, are laid off, other jobs are over, and they need that quick access to cash.\"\n\nPamela Hudson recently stopped by the Bronx Library Center to meet with a career coach who helped her complete an online job application for a supervisor position.\n\nCommunities like the Bronx, she says, need to be counted accurately so that they get their fair share of the hundreds of billions of federal tax dollars distributed based on census numbers.\n\n\"I'm thinking about transitioning into this job because it's very important to me,\" Hudson adds. \"We have children that need education. We have children that need health care.\"\n\nConcerns about census funding\n\nThe partial government shutdown, however, did give Hudson pause about working for the Census Bureau. She noticed the bureau was not updating portions of its website during the shutdown because of \"a lapse in federal funding,\" according to a banner splashed across the site.\n\n\"I'm concerned about that,\" Hudson says, wondering if census workers may not get paid if there's another funding stalemate.\n\nIn case there's another shutdown in the coming weeks, the bureau has said it has enough money to work on the 2020 census into April.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hansi Lo Wang/NPR Hansi Lo Wang/NPR\n\nWhatever happens, Tayesha Hudson, no relation to Pamela, says she is not worried.\n\n\"I know eventually the government is going to have to get it together, and I know that they're going to want this 2020 census to go forward,\" she says.\n\nTayesha Hudson is interested in helping with door-knocking and collecting census information in the Bronx. If she is hired for the job, though, she expects to do a lot of persuading of community members who, she says, may not see the point of participating in the census.\n\nWe're all in this life just trying to make sure that we can go day by day, so we all should be counted.\n\n\"It's about making sure that we get the things that we need in our community, that everybody is counted regardless of their race, regardless of whether or not they're a citizen,\" she says. \"We're all in this life just trying to make sure that we can go day by day, so we all should be counted.\"\n\nThe challenge of the citizenship question\n\nThe controversy over the citizenship question the Trump administration wants to add to the 2020 census could pose another challenge to recruiting and hiring. The question asks, \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\"\n\nA federal judge in New York, who presided over the two lead lawsuits about the question, has ordered the administration to stop plans to include it on forms for the head count. But the administration \u2013 which is facing five other citizenship question lawsuits \u2014 wants the Supreme Court to let the question stay.\n\nIf it does, many census workers will have a harder job, says Elzie Wright, a program coordinator for the Christopher Rose Community Empowerment Campaign, based in Brooklyn.\n\n\"They know that they probably won't get too many answers or too many participants, especially now in this environment,\" explains Wright, who has worked on outreach to the Haitian community in Brooklyn. \"Let's face it: There's a lot of undocumented people in the community. And that makes them suspicious to talk to anybody.\"\n\nThe Census Bureau is expecting fewer households to respond to the census if there is a citizenship question. It plans to use results from an upcoming field test of people's responses to the question to update its recruiting strategy as the head count draws closer.\n\nThat means the bureau could have to hire even more workers."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/677745758/hurdles-remain-as-the-final-countdown-begins-for-the-2020-census", "text": "Hurdles Remain As The Final Countdown Begins For The 2020 Census\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nUpdated Jan. 18 at 6:12 p.m. ET\n\nThe last stretch before the start of the 2020 census is upon us.\n\nThe once-a-decade, national head count is scheduled to kick off next January. Census workers start in the village of Toksook Bay and other parts of rural Alaska when the ground there is frozen enough for door-to-door visits. Then, beginning in March 2020, the U.S. government's most expansive peacetime operation rolls out to households in the rest of the country.\n\nThe data collected will be used for a major reset in political power and federal funding through 2030. Each state's share of representatives in Congress, as well as votes in the Electoral College, will be determined for the next decade by the new population counts. Those counts are also used to distribute more than $880 billion a year in federal funds for Medicare, schools and other public services, according to the latest estimate by The George Washington Institute of Public Policy.\n\nBut before the government can carry out its constitutional mandate to count every person living in the country, it has plenty of hurdles to clear in 2019. Here are five of the most pressing questions surrounding the upcoming census.\n\n1. Will there be enough money for the census?\n\nThe Census Bureau is closed because of the government shutdown, but work for the 2020 census is continuing for now thanks to carryover funding from the 2018 omnibus spending bill President Trump signed in March.\n\nThe bureau estimates that funding can last at least through March or into April with \"no change to the schedule, cost, or scale\" of the 2020 head count, according to a statement from the bureau's public information office.\n\nIn case the shutdown lasts longer \u2014 as Trump has threatened \u2014 the Census Bureau has started looking into ways to \"extend the length of the funds without notable programmatic slowdowns,\" the agency's statement says.\n\nNext year's head count is expected to be the most expensive in U.S. history. The Census Bureau estimates it will cost a total of $15.6 billion. Spending for the census is already ramping up as the bureau begins opening temporary local offices around the country this month and prepares to launch a national advertising campaign in January 2020.\n\nLast year, Congress significantly boosted funding for the agency, reversing years of lawmakers not matching the funding levels agency officials said they would need. Past funding uncertainty has forced the bureau to cancel some field tests for the census, including ones designed to work out the logistics of counting rural areas and collecting Spanish-language responses.\n\nNow, census advocates are watching to see if the census gets caught in a prolonged funding stalemate with the partial federal government shutdown \u2013 a scenario that could impact the hiring of census workers, advertising plans and IT systems preparations for the first U.S. census to allow all households to respond online.\n\n2. What will happen to plans to add a citizenship question?\n\nThe Trump administration is fighting seven lawsuits over a hotly contested question it added to the 2020 census last year \u2013 \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\"\n\nWhile the administration insists the Justice Department wants responses to the question to help protect the voting rights of racial and language minorities, more than two dozen states and cities, plus other critics, worry the question will discourage households with noncitizens, including unauthorized immigrants, from participating in the census.\n\nIn the two lead lawsuits in New York, a federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to stop its plan to add the question.\n\nThe legal battle is expected to make its way to the Supreme Court this year. Whether the question stays or goes has to be finalized by June, the Census Bureau says, so that printing the paper questionnaires can be completed without disrupting the tight deadlines leading up to 2020.\n\nAs the issue winds its way through the courts, some Democrats in Congress are exploring other ways to stop the administration's plans. One possibility is including language in a spending bill that would defund the question.\n\n\"Whether through the appropriations process, the courts, or elsewhere, we must act to make sure an untested citizenship question is not on the 2020 Census,\" says Democratic Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano of New York \u2014 who now chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the census \u2014 in a written statement.\n\nAnother front to watch is the Democrat-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Its newly-named chair, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, says he plans to investigate why Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, approved adding the question.\n\n\"Secretary Ross told Congress it was all the Justice Department's idea when evidence indicates he orchestrated the whole thing,\" Cummings says in a written statement. \"We will get to the bottom of this issue.\"\n\nTestimony by Ross at a congressional hearing, as well as any internal documents lawmakers uncover, could be used against the Trump administration in the citizenship question lawsuits.\n\n\"We'll be watching closely and listening intently to any subsequent representations that Ross makes to the public,\" says Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is representing plaintiffs in one of the California-based lawsuits.\n\nSo far, Ross has avoided having to sit for questioning under oath by the plaintiffs' attorneys. The Supreme Court was planning to weigh in on whether Ross can be deposed for the lawsuits, but the justices cancelled oral arguments after the ruling by the federal judge in New York neutralized the issue.\n\nIf the citizenship question does stay on the 2020 census forms, the responses collected could dramatically reshape the political maps of some states and local communities. According to a Federal Register notice submitted by the Commerce Department in December, the Census Bureau is planning to ask state and local officials in charge of redistricting whether they want citizenship data from the 2020 census. That data, if it becomes available, could be used to redraw voting districts based on the number of U.S. citizens rather than on all residents regardless of citizenship.\n\n3. Is the online U.S. census prepared for cybersecurity threats?\n\nTo cut down on costs and keep up with the digital age we're living in, the Census Bureau is preparing to allow all households to submit their 2020 census responses through the internet. The new convenience, however, has raised questions about whether the Census Bureau is prepared for the potential risk to people's privacy.\n\n\"Because the 2020 Census involves collecting personal information from over a hundred million households across the country, it will be important that the Bureau addresses system security weaknesses in a timely manner and ensures that risks are at an acceptable level before systems are deployed,\" investigators at the Government Accountability Office wrote in a recent report.\n\nLast June, the Census Bureau identified close to 3,100 security weaknesses in the IT systems for the 2020 census, according to the report.\n\nThe bureau is preparing for potential problem scenarios, including denial-of-service attacks that crash the online questionnaire, fake websites impersonating the Census Bureau, and hacking of phones, laptops and other electronic devices used by the bureau's employees. Officials, however, say they're not planning to go into the details with the public.\n\n\"We have not shared our plans for cybersecurity with the public intentionally to not give the opposing team, adversaries wanting to discredit the federal government, an advantage,\" the Census Bureau's chief information officer, Kevin Smith, wrote in a blog post in August.\n\n4. Can the Census Bureau hire enough census workers?\n\nFor the last census in 2010, the U.S. government hired about 635,000 temporary workers to collect responses in person from households that did not complete or mail back a census form. Help will be wanted again in 2020, but the low unemployment rate is putting pressure on the Census Bureau's recruiting efforts.\n\nUsing iPhones to enter and submit people's information online is expected to help census workers be more productive in the field. Still, the bureau is planning to launch an advertising campaign targeting not only unemployed workers but also those who are already working and have evenings and weekends free.\n\n\"If you're paying any attention to the news, teachers are complaining about needing to make more money,\" Albert Fontenot, the Census Bureau's head of the 2020 census, said during a public meeting in October. \"Teachers love to do the census. It's a great opportunity for them to partake in democracy and be able to tell their students about what they do.\"\n\n5. Will the census undercount communities of color and other hard-to-count populations?\n\nThe Census Bureau is charged with counting every person living in the U.S. every 10 years. But some populations have been more difficult to tally up accurately than others.\n\nIn 2010, the bureau over-counted white people who did not identify as Hispanic, while net undercounting close to 2.1 percent of black residents and 1.5 percent of Latino residents \u2014 or more than 1.5 million people in total \u2014 according to estimates from a Census Bureau study.\n\nThe bureau is trying to overcome this challenge of reaching \"hard-to-count\" groups, in part, by increasing the number of languages that responses can be submitted in and starting to hire workers to coordinate outreach efforts with local organizations earlier than it did for the 2010 census.\n\nStill, the NAACP is leading a lawsuit alleging that the Census Bureau's \"deficient\" preparations for 2020 risk a \"massive undercount\" of communities of color, according to its complaint. The Trump administration has asked a federal judge in Maryland to dismiss the case.\n\nCritics of the citizenship question are concerned that asking about U.S. citizenship status will jeopardize the accuracy of the information collected, especially data about many hard-to-count populations.\n\nBeginning in June, the bureau is planning to conduct the first-ever field test of a 2020 census form with the citizenship question. Results, officials say, will inform decisions on whether to hire more census workers and adapt the 2020 census marketing campaign due to any negative response to the question.\n\nSome census advocates are worried that a citizenship question would deter community groups from helping to promote the census.\n\n\"The @uscensusbureau should be praying for these [citizenship question] lawsuits to succeed. They cannot expect that the 'trusted messengers' like @NALEO will do their job for them!\" wrote Arturo Vargas, the CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, in a tweet in September.\n\nLast November, an email released as part of the citizenship question lawsuits alarmed some community groups preparing to drum up public interest in the census.\n\nFederal law prohibits the release of an individual's census responses until 72 years after the data are collected. But concerns about confidentiality surfaced after the internal email revealed a Justice Department discussion about the possibility of \"renewed debate\" over whether the Patriot Act, passed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, could force individuals' confidential census responses to be released earlier."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2019/01/31/690361685/sanford-sylvan-a-baritone-on-his-own-terms-dies-at-65", "text": "Sanford Sylvan, A Baritone On His Own Terms, Dies At 65\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption William Clift/Nonesuch Records William Clift/Nonesuch Records\n\nThe beloved American baritone Sanford Sylvan died Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. Lenore Sylvan, the singer's mother, along with his sister Gwen Sylvan and brother Seth Sylvan confirmed the death to NPR Thursday morning. Marc Mandel, a close family friend and director of program publications at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, said that the death was \"entirely sudden\" and that it was \"deemed to be of natural causes.\" Sylvan was 65.\n\nAlthough Sylvan may be best remembered by a wider public for his arresting performances in productions by Peter Sellars, including the director's decidedly modern takes on Mozart's Cos\u00ec fan tutte and The Marriage of Figaro, which were broadcast on PBS in the 1980s, he ultimately avoided the glitzy life of an opera star.\n\nSoprano Susan Larson, who sang in three operas with Sylvan, remembers his sense of humor. \"He could be seriously funny, or funnily serious, somber and crazy at any time in rehearsal and performance,\" she wrote in an email to NPR. \"He was just so there, so intent and intense ... Cos\u00ec [fan tutte] is my favorite Sandy opera, because I got to sing with him the most. Those ensembles! Those finales! The memories of that one Cos\u00ec performance that was perfect from start to finish: We kept meeting each other backstage where he would whisper, 'Damn! We can do no wrong tonight!' Once in a lifetime, we were all gods together.\"\n\nEarly in his career, Sylvan made an unusual move away from New York to Boston, where he focused on singing with small forces, including performing many Bach cantatas at Emmanuel Church, where he first met Sellars.\n\nYouTube\n\nSylvan became widely praised as a recitalist, specializing in art songs \u2013 from Schubert song cycles to new music from American composers such as John Adams. In 1989, Sylvan debuted Adams' The Wound-Dresser, set to a text by Walt Whitman. The recording, released the same year and nominated for a Grammy, became an immediate favorite among Sylvan's admirers.\"In vocal recitals, it's just you and the pianist speaking to people about intimate topics, using the most direct, honest form of communication you can,\" Sylvan told the Los Angeles Times in 1998.\n\nAt another point in his career, Sylvan quit singing for nine months, leaving for Scotland to meditate on what his life with \u2013 and without \u2013 music should be, as he told author Peter G. Davis for the book The American Opera Singer, published in 1997:\n\n\"I needed to find out who I was when I wasn't a singer. I had to take that time to do it myself, so I stopped. And it was a great thing. It helped me understand that it's my choice \u2013 that we can't become victims of a system that we think owns us. Now I sing because I choose to, and my career goes the way it goes because I make the choices.\"\n\nSylvan's warm, agile baritone, and the way he used it, made him an uncommonly communicative singer. \"Sanford makes the performance as human as possible, getting out of the way to let the poet and composer speak,\" David Breitman, Sylvan's longtime artistic partner and accompanist, told the Los Angeles Times in 1998.\n\nSylvan, born Dec. 19, 1953, was raised in New York and fell in love with music at an early age. \"His dedication to music started when he was about five years old,\" Sylvan's mother recalls. \"He had me going to pick up records from the library because they wouldn't give them to him.\"\n\nSylvan fibbed about his age when he applied to the Juilliard School's pre-college division long before he reached the prescribed age of 16. He entered the Manhattan School of Music after high school, and earned money by ushering at the Metropolitan Opera. At Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home in the Berkshire Mountains, Sylvan studied with the revered American soprano Phyllis Curtin, who emphasized that he sing in unaffected American English, something composers like John Adams have admired.\n\n\"Sandy has this way of singing American English, with its peculiar rhythms and making it sound utterly natural and beautiful to the ear,\" Adams told the Los Angeles Times in 1992.\n\nYouTube\n\nSylvan shined in other Sellars-Adams projects, including performing the wheelchair-bound lead role in Adams' opera The Death of Klinghoffer in 1991 and as Chou En-lai in Adams' first opera, 1987's Nixon In China, the recording of which won a Grammy in 1988. He worked with many of the world's renowned conductors, including Pierre Boulez, Simon Rattle, Christoph von Dohnanyi and Christopher Hogwood, and he sang in many of the world's top opera houses and concert halls.\n\nIn recent years, Sylvan concentrated on his teaching. He held positions at Tanglewood, where he was master teacher in residence, at Montreal's McGill University and at Bard College, where he taught in the graduate vocal arts program. He was a faculty member at the Juilliard School since 2012.\n\n\"Not only was he a professional singer,\" said Sylvan's sister Gwen, \"as a teacher of voice, he allowed his students to emerge, to really find their own voices. I look at his life as such a full, total life. It's extraordinary in terms of his gift as singer \u2013 his voice was absolutely healing. But his teaching, in the latter part of his lifetime \u2014 he was so devoted to his students, and they were to him.\"\n\nNPR's Andrew Flanagan contributed additional reporting."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/30/689883651/pressure-on-maduro-intensifies-as-venezuela-braces-for-more-protests", "text": "'Stop The Maduro Genocide': Protesters March In Venezuela With U.S. Support\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Federico Parra/AFP/Getty Images Federico Parra/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 4:40 p.m. ET\n\nProtesters filled streets across Venezuela on Wednesday in a show of strength for Juan Guaid\u00f3, the U.S.-backed opposition leader who has declared himself interim president and called for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to step down.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 made a surprise appearance in front of a cheering crowd at the Central University of Venezuela in the nation's capital, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe demonstrations marked a week since the 35-year-old took the oath of office in Caracas.

Hyperinflation and a plummeting economy have caused widespread hunger and a shortage in medical supplies.\n\nAt one hospital, a protester held a sign that said \"Our children die as they wait for surgery.\"\n\nMedical students said a lack of supplies and medicines such as insulin are killing their patients.\n\nEconomist Ricardo Hausmann told NPR's The Indicator that a Venezuelan earning a median salary would be able to buy fewer than two eggs on a day's wage. A survey from three universities in Venezuela found that citizens lost 24 pounds on average in 2017 because of the food shortage. Maduro's government has struggled to address the hardship and once drew ridicule for suggesting people eat rabbits to survive.\n\nProtesters on Wednesday used the word for \"usurper\" to describe Maduro. In the Caracas neighborhood of Chacao, protesters stood on a road and waved Venezuelan flags. One held a placard that said \"Stop the Maduro Genocide.\"\n\nMaduro has shown no signs of relenting to the opposition. He retaliated by freezing Guad\u00f3's bank accounts and barring him from traveling overseas. Venezuela's chief prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, announced a criminal probe Tuesday into Guaid\u00f3's anti-government activities. In a video posted to Facebook and subtitled in English, Maduro accused President Trump of orchestrating a coup against his regime in an attempt to steal Venezuela's oil resources, and he warned the U.S. against military intervention.\n\n\"Let us not allow another war like Vietnam in Latin America,\" Maduro declared. \"Venezuela has a strong democracy. We have our own problems, as any other country, and we will solve them by ourselves.\"\n\nMaduro also joined dozens of evangelical supporters in a prayer session that was aired on state TV, appealing to an \"all powerful God\" to bless the nation, the AP reported.\n\nThe U.S., in turn, has ratcheted up pressure on Maduro's government. On Monday, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-run oil company, and a day later, the State Department said it had granted Guaid\u00f3 authority to take control of Venezuelan government assets held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or any other U.S.-insured banks.\n\nThe U.S. is Venezuela's biggest customer for oil, and production is expected to drop if Maduro remains in power.\n\nWorld powers have lined up on either side of the Venezuelan crisis. Some two dozen countries, including several Latin American nations, Australia, Canada and Israel, have backed Guaid\u00f3. A number of Western European countries have said they will side with him if Maduro does not call new elections.\n\nRussia and China continue to support Maduro's regime with loans and political support at the U.N. Security Council. Private military contractors linked to Russia's government are also rumored to be in Venezuela protecting Maduro, Reuters reported, citing sources close to the contractors.\n\nOn Wednesday, Guaid\u00f3 called on Venezuelan armed forces to \"cross over to our side, the side of the constitution.\"\n\nSo far, the vast majority of Venezuela's military has remained loyal to the sitting president and ignored Guaid\u00f3's appeals. On Wednesday, Maduro presided over military exercises and rallied rows of troops in green fatigues, invoking the liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and referring to the U.S. support of Guaid\u00f3 as imperialism.\n\n\"The sun is rising,\" Maduro said. \"January is gone. And rebellious February, anti-imperialist February, is coming.\"\n\nMaduro has offered to talk with the opposition, but Guaid\u00f3 is likely to refuse negotiations because he does not recognize Maduro as the leader of the country.\n\nLast week, Guaid\u00f3 successfully summoned hundreds of thousands of people for protests, as NPR has reported. The U.N. said Tuesday that 40 people are believed to have been killed during the weeklong political standoff. More than half of them are believed to have been shot by security forces or pro-government forces while protesting, and one member of the National Guard is also believed to have been killed during protests. More than 850 people are thought to have been detained.\n\nTwo French reporters covering the protests for the TV program Quotidien have been arrested, Reuters reports, citing a French diplomatic source.\n\n\n\nGuaid\u00f3 has called for more protests on Saturday.\n\nVenezuela expert Bruce Bagley at the University of Miami said social protests and foreign pressure were unlikely to push Maduro out of office unless the military switched allegiances.\n\n\"Maduro doesn't care how many countries condemn him,\" Bagley told NPR.\"The fulcrum is the military.\"\n\nThe U.S. intervention is welcome among Venezuelans who are fed up with Maduro, NPR has reported, but worries remain that any transition would be violent, as hard-line pro-government troops, police and militias hold fast.\n\nLatin America Venezuelan President Maduro Faces Intensified Pressure To Step Down Venezuelan President Maduro Faces Intensified Pressure To Step Down Listen \u00b7 5:07 5:07\n\nSo far, Washington has leveraged only political and financial pressure on Maduro. However, in a Monday briefing, national security adviser John Bolton held a yellow notepad containing a scrawled note that read in part \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"\n\nThe White House has repeatedly said that \"all options are on the table\" regarding Venezuela.\n\nThe State Department has warned U.S. citizens not to travel to Venezuela because of crime, civil unrest and the risk of detention. All nonemergency U.S. personnel have been ordered to leave.\n\nNPR's Isabel Lara contributed to this report."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/31/688199494/the-women-behind-the-songs-jessie-mae-robinson", "text": "The Women Behind The Songs: Jessie Mae Robinson\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the Robinson family Courtesy of the Robinson family\n\nMany may know Wanda Jackson's 1960s hit \"Let's Have a Party,\" or even the versions performed by Led Zeppelin and Elvis Presley, but most will not recognize the name of the woman who wrote it: Jessie Mae Robinson.\n\nWhether she was composing party songs or heartbreak songs, Robinson wrote with the concise, evocative language of a journalist. She gave her characters dignity no matter who they were or what they were doing.\n\nBorn in Texas in 1918 and raised in California, Robinson's songs have been recorded by hundreds of artists, from Louis Jordan to Lana Del Rey.\n\nGrowing up in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, Robinson found a supportive community, and plenty of opportunities to explore her creative interests. She became a champion tap dancer, competing at the old Largo Theater. As a teenager, she wrote a column for the California Eagle newspaper. She earned an Actors' Equity card, performing in WPA musicals like Show Boat.\n\nBut Robinson also had a penchant for making up melodies and writing poetry. She was encouraged to become a songwriter by neighborhood friend Joe Adams, who'd go on to manage Ray Charles and Dootsie Williams. Williams owned a local studio, where Robinson got her songwriting start. She caught a break in 1945, when a young Dinah Washington released \"Mellow Mama Blues.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nRobinson was an African American woman working mostly on her own in the 1940s and 50s, but she challenged a music industry determined to pigeonhole her into writing only blues and R&B. She loved Tin Pan Alley and show tunes, and refused to be confined by genre.\n\nIn 1952, Robinson had her first pop music crossover success when Patti Page recorded her song, \"I Went To Your Wedding,\" about watching the love of your life marry someone else.\n\nA self-taught musician, Robinson wrote songs even when she had no access to an instrument. She'd hum melodies into a tape recorder, and scribble lyrics on random pieces of paper. She didn't learn to drive until age 30, so early in her career, she'd take a bus to Hollywood, and have her songs transcribed onto sheet music that the studio musicians could read.\n\nYouTube\n\nIn the early 1960s, Robinson started her own record labels, naming the first one after her daughter, June. Though she loved music, Robinson had grown tired of the industry. She was physically tired, too. Robinson's health was in decline, and in 1966 she sought treatment for a chronic throat problem. The doctors suggested surgery, but she said no, fearful of permanently losing her voice.\n\nRobinson died in 1966 at age 48, leaving behind a body of work that reflects who she was: soft-spoken yet self-possessed, imaginative and ambitious. She was a uniquely gifted composer with an eye for detail that most people overlook and the ability to pack so much emotion into just a few words."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/23/687749466/watch-in-china-school-principal-leads-students-in-dancing-to-a-new-beat", "text": "WATCH: In China, School Principal Leads Students In Dancing To A New Beat\n\ntoggle caption Screenshot by NPR/China Xinhua News/Twitter\n\nThe image of a Chinese schoolyard full of students doing calisthenics isn't new.\n\nBut these moves definitely are.\n\nDressed in a sleek black-on-black ensemble, school principal Zhang Pengfei leads his students in a synchronized routine that would turn heads in any dance club.

Several Democratic presidential hopefuls are getting behind the idea.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., endorsed the approach Monday in a CNN town hall-style event, saying her aim would be to eliminate all private insurance.\n\n\"Who of us has not had that situation, where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor says, well, 'I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this,' \" Harris said. \"Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on.\"\n\nHarris was a co-sponsor of a 2017 bill written by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would have created a national, single-payer health system, eliminating the private insurance system.\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., both presidential hopefuls, also co-sponsored the Sanders bill.\n\nEveryone would get a Medicare card and doctors would have to sign annual agreements to participate.\n\nThe major questions the candidates face is how the government would pay for it.\n\nTotal spending on health care in the U.S. was about $3.5 trillion in 2017 and is forecast to rise to $5.7 trillion in 2026, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe federal government already pays for a lot of that through Medicare, Medicaid, military health care and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Much of the rest is through employer health insurance plans and individual health insurance and payments by patients.\n\nSanders laid out several options to pay for his proposal, including increasing taxes on employers who would no longer be paying insurance premiums; increasing individual income taxes; and boosting taxes on the wealthy.\n\nHarris didn't say, in the town hall-style meeting, how she would pay for the program. And her Senate office didn't respond to an email asking whether she has a funding proposal.\n\nWarren has proposed a 2 percent tax on the wealth of an individual that's above $50 million and 3 percent on wealth of more than $1 billion.\n\nThe mechanism for paying for \"Medicare-for-all\" can make the politics muddy.\n\nA recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that 56 percent of people in the U.S. like the idea overall.\n\nBut when people heard more details, those numbers changed.\n\nWhen the question included the idea that \"Medicare-for-all\" would guarantee health insurance as a right, its support rose to 71 percent. But when it said people would have to pay more taxes, the popularity plummeted to 37 percent.\n\nThat dynamic has created an opening for potential centrist candidates to stake out a middle road.\n\nHoward Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, who has said he is considering a presidential run, told CBS reporters that Harris' proposal to eliminate the health insurance industry is \"not American.\" He also called proposed tax increases on the wealthy \"punitive.\"\n\nMike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and founder of Bloomberg LP, who is also considering a run, said in New Hampshire Tuesday that he, too, opposed the idea.\n\n\"To replace the entire private system where companies provide health care for their employees would bankrupt us for a very long time,\" he told workers at a factory he was visiting.\n\nBloomberg has said he supports opening Medicare to people who don't have coverage through their employers.\n\nThe health insurance industry is already gearing up to oppose any \"Medicare-for-all\" proposals, according to The Intercept, an investigative news website."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/30/689868988/wednesday-january-30th-2019", "text": "Wednesday, January 30th, 2019\n\nA crucial round of trade talks with China kicks off.

U.S. increases pressure on Venezuela's president to step down. And, what does Medicare for all mean?\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThis morning, we're going to bring you everything you need to know about not one, Steve, not one but two different sets of high-stakes negotiations taking place in Washington today.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nOK. Republican and Democratic leaders are meeting to discuss border security. They need to agree on measures that can pass Congress and win the signature of the president in order to avoid another partial government shutdown in a couple weeks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell describes himself as flexible up to a point.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL: I'm for whatever works that prevents the level of dysfunction we've seen on full display here the last month and also doesn't bring about a view on the president's part that he needs to declare a national emergency.\n\nINSKEEP: There's a little warning at the end there since the president has threatened to bypass Congress to have a border wall built by declaring an emergency. So that's one negotiation. The other is, if anything, a much bigger deal. Chinese negotiators are in Washington to discuss a way out of a trade war.\n\nMARTIN: Oh, yeah, that. So NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us this morning. Hi, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: Let's start with the trade negotiations - U.S. top trade negotiators sitting down with their Chinese counterparts. What is supposed to happen today?\n\nLIASSON: Well, the U.S. wants two things. The first thing is they want the trade deficit with China to come down. They want China, in other words, to buy more U.S. soybeans and other commodities. The second thing they want is harder to get. They want China to stop intellectual property theft, stop forcing U.S. companies to turn over their technology secrets. They want to stop China requiring U.S. companies to have a Chinese partner. In other words, they want China to change its business model. That's harder to do.\n\nThe big question is will Donald Trump settle for the first thing? In other words, will he just settle for China buying more soybeans, or will he insist that China makes these structural changes? And then, if the Chinese do agree to do that, how do you verify that?\n\nMARTIN: Right. And, of course, all this is happening against this backdrop of, you know, the Chinese CFO of Huawei was arrested and all this international - or intellectual property theft that you referred to. I mean, are they - is the U.S. delegation expecting some kind of win out of this, or is this an incremental development?\n\nLIASSON: Well, nobody says that this will be easy. The big question about the Huawei indictments is will that become a bargaining chip in these trade talks? Or to put it another way, how does it not become a bargaining chip? And we don't know the answer to that yet.\n\nMARTIN: Let's pivot and think about the negotiations on Capitol Hill to keep the government open. The team of 17 lawmakers has been tasked with finding a solution that they couldn't find for over a month. President Trump, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, gave this effort a less than 50/50 chance of succeeding. So, I mean, he's undercutting them before they even get going.\n\nLIASSON: Right. Well, the big question is Democrats now have not ruled out spending some kind of money for border security - barriers, a smart wall. They don't want what they say is President Trump's medieval wall. And the president is no longer demanding 2,000 miles of sea-to-shining-sea concrete barrier. He wants a couple billion dollars a year for 200-plus miles of border wall. And the question is, can they come up with a compromise that fudges this difference where both sides can say they won?\n\nMARTIN: Do you see that opening?\n\nLIASSON: I am not sure. I think it's possible we're headed for another impasse, but I don't think we're headed for another shutdown.\n\nMARTIN: There's just not the appetite for that.\n\nLIASSON: So you heard Mitch McConnell say he doesn't want the president to declare an emergency. He doesn't - didn't say I'm worried the president will shut down the government again.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: All right. Let's shift our focus over to Venezuela. There are more protests expected there today and more pressure on President Nicolas Maduro to step down.\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah. These will be the first mass protests since the opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself as president or was declared by the legislature as president. They said they were following the constitution. Guaido does have the support of the United States and other countries. He - however, President Nicolas Maduro has ordered authorities in Venezuela, the Supreme Court, to put a travel ban on Guaido, and all of his bank accounts have been frozen.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Philip Reeves joins us from Caracas, where he's covering all of this political drama. Hey, Phil.\n\nPHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Hi.\n\nMARTIN: We've got a delay on the line. We should just note that. So the opposition led by Juan Guaido is calling for these protests. Is there an expectation they could get violent today?\n\nREEVES: Well, there is, yeah. He's calling for people to walk out for two hours out of their homes and offices and shops and so on. And he's calling for it to be a nonviolent protest. You know, he successfully summoned hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets last week, so I expect this will be large. Some areas, we're expecting crowds; others may just be people on the streets banging pots and pans. We don't know how Maduro's security forces are going to react. According to the U.N. Human Rights Office, 40 people have been killed since this crisis really erupted nine days ago, most by Venezuela security services. And yeah, the worry is that there will be more bloodshed.\n\nMARTIN: I mean, Maduro has told the Supreme Court to put this travel ban on the opposition leader, Juan Guaido. At the same time, Maduro says he's open to negotiating, but that doesn't seem like a negotiating kind of posture, to tell your opposition that, you know, your bank accounts are frozen and you can't go anywhere. What are the odds that these two men actually get in a room?\n\nREEVES: Well, let's not forget that Maduro accuses Guaido of staging an attempted coup with U.S. collaboration. So a travel ban (laughter) is kind of rather a light response. Most countries, you would be in jail if you were also at the same time summoning huge crowds out in the street to support you. So I think Maduro is trying to feel his way here. He talks about negotiating, but, you know, I can't see how the opposition will do that with a man they don't recognize as president, unless it's a specific discussion about his departure.\n\nMARTIN: Meanwhile...\n\nREEVES: And also there's no sign that Maduro's interested in a discussion about his departure, I should add. I mean, Maduro is standing firm when it comes to the issue of his departure.\n\nMARTIN: Meanwhile, the U.S., the Trump administration, has cut off Maduro's revenues from oil and is exerting a lot of influence in Venezuela in hopes of pushing Maduro out of power. How is that being received? I mean, what do Venezuelans on the street, the protesters, make of the U.S. involvement?\n\nREEVES: Well, I think the protesters appreciate it, but I think a lot of people are also very worried. It's very hard to see how we can avoid a very violent situation evolving here. Let's say, best-case scenario, that Maduro goes, but what happens then? Will the police and the national guard just show up for work the next day, saying that, you know, the Venezuelan socialist experiment's over, we work for someone else now?\n\nThere's a very high risk there'll be a vacuum for a while while these security forces figure out who's in charge and while the strongly pro-Maduro elements disappear. And, remember; this country's got a population that's very hungry and very poor, mightily abused and angry. I don't see how you could avoid a situation where, in those circumstances, there will be mass looting. And that's in the opposition's best-case scenario.\n\nMARTIN: Thanks so much...\n\nREEVES: It could get much worse than that.\n\nMARTIN: Right. Thanks so much, Phil. NPR's Phil Reeves in Caracas for us.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: OK. Back in this country, Democratic presidential hopefuls are already staking out their positions on critical issues, including health care.\n\nINSKEEP: Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in a CNN town hall meeting earlier this week and supported Medicare for all.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: It is inhumane to make people go through a system where they cannot literally receive the benefit of what medical science can offer.\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah, in the town hall, she supported not only government insurance for everybody but also eliminating the private insurance industry. Who needs it, she effectively said. Afterward, her campaign walked that back, saying that she would be open to more modest reforms, which suggests just how politically tricky health care remains.\n\nMARTIN: All right. We have got NPR health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak with us this morning. Hey, Alison.\n\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. How are you?\n\nMARTIN: I'm well. This is a big question to start off our day here. But what does Medicare for all mean exactly?\n\nKODJAK: Well, it depends on who you talk to. But the plan that Senator Harris says she supports is the one that was proposed last year by Senator Bernie Sanders. And this would be a national health program that would, as she said, replace the private health insurance system. Here's how she described it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHARRIS: Well, listen; the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require.\n\nKODJAK: So her idea is that everyone gets a Medicare card just like the one that my mother has, and doctors have to sign an agreement each year to be part of the program.\n\nMARTIN: This is the same as when people say single payer.\n\nKODJAK: Exactly. Exactly. The government is that payer.\n\nMARTIN: How does she want to pay for this, or any Democratic candidate for that matter?\n\nKODJAK: Exactly. I mean, that's a big unknown. It's going to cost a lot of money. Harris said in that town hall, and when I asked her staff, they didn't respond. She didn't respond, and she didn't describe it. In his proposal, Senator Sanders didn't put in a pay for, but he outlined some options. He said that overall as a country, we spend $3.2 trillion a year on health care, and that includes Medicare, Medicaid and our private insurance system. And he says Medicare for all will cost a lot less.\n\nAnother analysis I've seen says the federal government will pay $32 trillion over 10 years to pay for Medicare for all. So the pay-for proposals mostly include maybe a tax increase on employers, similar to Social Security tax. One proposal is a 4 percent tax on everyone's income. There's basically tax increases on higher earners. It's a way of increasing taxes and replacing what we spend right now on health care premiums.\n\nMARTIN: Since then, as Steve noted, though, Kamala Harris' campaign backed down a bit on this and said, wait a second, she also might be willing to consider other more moderate proposals instead of an altogether single-payer system, clearly indicating this is a political bugaboo for Democrats. It's not like they're all in line for this.\n\nKODJAK: Yeah. No, it's really tricky. I mean, a lot of people co-sponsored that bill, including other presidential candidates, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren. But it's tricky because people like the idea of Medicare for all. But once you talk about the tax increases, it becomes much, much less popular.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Alison Kodjak for us this morning. Thanks, Alison. We appreciate it.\n\nKODJAK: Thanks, Rachel.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Progressives Split By Another Sanders Bid\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Eisen/Getty Images Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n\nIn the spring of 2015, before Bernie Sanders had a campaign office in New Hampshire, Elizabeth Ropp, an acupuncturist, was making homemade signs for the Vermont senator.\n\n\"Bernie inspired me because as somebody who's lived without health insurance for most of my adult life, I want there to be a single-payer health care system,\" she said.\n\nShe was disappointed Sanders wasn't the nominee and is convinced that if he had been, Donald Trump would not be president.\n\n\"I want to see Bernie run again in 2020,\" said Ropp. \"We need Bernie to run even if the field is crowded.\"\n\nThe 77-year-old Vermont senator has not announced his plans, but he has sparked plenty of speculation.\n\nIn 2016, Sanders created a powerful progressive movement in a thin primary field. The dilemma for him now is that nearly every other Democratic presidential contender is adopting his positions on issues like health care and minimum wage, which means progressive voters in 2020 have plenty of other choices.\n\n\"Medicare-for-all,\" $15 minimum wage\n\nEarlier this month, when Sanders reintroduced a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, every Democrat in the Senate who's rumored to be considering a run for president co-sponsored his legislation: Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR\n\n\"He has made it legitimate to talk about things that a lot of us used to mumble,\" said Arnie Arnesen, a radio show host and former New Hampshire politician who thinks of herself as Sanders' ideological twin.\n\nArnesen says she's grateful that he ran in 2016 because he helped \"expose some of the rot\" in her own party.\n\nSanders has helped change the Democratic National Committee rules for selecting a nominee, curtailing the role of superdelegates and shaped the current Democratic economic message. But Arnesen wonders whether he's the right candidate for the White House.\n\n\"My question is, does he provide added value in this campaign for 2020? Or are there a lot of people who sort of carry very similar messages?\" asked Arnesen, before answering her own question.\n\n\"Does it have to be him? I don't think it does, and I admire him. I admire him to pieces.\"\n\nThe clearest example of the change is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who resigned as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee so she could endorse Sanders in the 2016 primary. Gabbard recently launched her own presidential bid.\n\nNot the only progressive option\n\nSanders' first decisive victory in 2016 came in the New Hampshire primary; he crushed Hillary Clinton there by 22 percentage points. And activists like Andru Volinsky were part of the reason he did so well.\n\nVolinsky, Sanders' New Hampshire campaign lawyer during the 2016 primary, said that if the Vermont senator were to run for president again, he would be his top choice.\n\nBut it's unclear whether Volinsky personally wants Sanders to run.\n\n\"I want a strong advocate for addressing issues like income inequality and health care access and climate action,\" said Volinsky. \"Sen. Sanders could be that strong voice. There are some others that could as well.\"\n\nMany voters who strongly backed Sanders in 2016 say they realize Sanders is not necessarily the only progressive option in 2020. For some, that's confusing, but for others, it's appealing.\n\nArnesen is excited by many of the candidates considering a run for the presidency; many of them, she believes, carry elements of Sanders' message.\n\nFor example, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, she says, has a lot of the same \"authenticity\" as Sanders \"without being 80 years old\" when he's elected (Sanders turns 79 in 2020).\n\n\"I think it's time for us to start creating a new bench,\" said Arnesen.\"And the new bench isn't old, it shouldn't be white, and it probably shouldn't be male.\"\n\nSome Sanders supporters also say the political environment has changed since 2016 and they want a candidate who can win.\n\n\"Electability has leaped to the forefront for me,\" said Ron Abramson, an immigration lawyer who served as a Sanders delegate to the DNC. \"I am prepared to support anyone who can help restore some measure of sanity [and] humanity.\"\n\nThose sentiments are not an isolated feeling.\n\n\"We're looking for somebody right now who can stand up to the nasty, nasty campaign that our idiot-in-chief the president is gonna run in 2020,\" said Bill Stelling, an activist who runs an art gallery in Manchester.\n\nStelling is not convinced Sanders is the right person for that job.\n\nEven though he was \"hugely inspired\" by Sanders' message in 2016 and donated to the Vermont senator's campaign, these days, he's impressed with California Sen. Kamala Harris; he thinks she's \"fearless.\"\n\nHe's also intrigued by Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who tried to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last year. This week, Stelling is going to a \"Draft Beto\" house party. He wanted to spread the word, so he posted a note about the meeting on Facebook but was disheartened by the response.\n\n\"I immediately got some snarky comments from progressives,\" said Stelling. \"It's so counterproductive.\"\n\nBut loyal Sanders supporters are unyielding in their devotion to the Vermont senator, because, they insist, he is the only one pushing the Democratic Party to the left.\n\n\"The other candidates are trying to posture themselves based on the assumption that Bernie Sanders is going to run,\" said Tim Smith, a four-term state legislator in Manchester and early Sanders supporter in the 2016 primary.\n\n\"They don't want to be seen as being members of the conservative wing of the party.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/28/689317960/the-mountain-goats-announces-dungeons-dragons-inspired-album", "text": "The Mountain Goats Announces Dungeons & Dragons-Inspired Album\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeremy Lange/Courtesy of the artist Jeremy Lange/Courtesy of the artist\n\nLately, John Darnielle's output \u2014 both as the creative leader of The Mountain Goats and as an individual entity \u2014 has read like a laundry list of his interests: full-length concept pieces about wrestling and goth culture, a collaborative podcast about his most beloved songs, and a couple novels for good measure. Now, we have another look into the inner workings of Darnielle's life with In League with Dragons, a 12-song album due out in April about the beloved tabletop role-playing game/lifestyle Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nIt's small wonder that Darnielle hasn't already crafted an album about D&D, given the extensive mythologizing and cult status that surrounds it.

He brands it \"dragon noir.\"\n\nDarnielle writes about In League with Dragons:\n\nThis album began life as a rock opera about a besieged seaside community called Riversend ruled by a benevolent wizard, for which some five to seven songs were written. When I'm focusing on a project, I always distract myself from the through-line with multiple byways, which are kind of like mini-games within the broader architecture of a long video game. As I worked on the Riversend stuff, weird noir visions started creeping in, probably under the influence of Leonardo Sciascia (a Sicilian author, he wrote mysteries) and Ross MacDonald's The Zebra-Striped Hearse, which a friend from Port Washington gave me while I was in the thick of the writing. I thought these moods helped complicate the wizards and dragons a little, and, as I thought about my wizard, his health failing, the invasion by sea almost certain to wipe out half his people, I thought about what such a person might look like in the real world: watching a country show at a midwestern casino, or tryout pitching for an American League team years after having lit up the marquees. Finally, I wrote the title track, which felt like a drawing-together of the themes in play: rebellion against irresistible tides, the lush vistas of decay, necessary alliances. I am earnestly hoping that a new genre called \"dragon noir\" will spring from the forehead of nearly two years' work on these songs, but, if not, I am content for this to be the sole example of the style.\n\n(If you're a player, or a Mountain Goats fan, Darnielle is hosting a premiere event Monday afternoon on Magic: The Gathering's Facebook page.)\n\nIn League With Dragons is out April 26 on Merge."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/29/689611873/in-maid-a-single-mother-finds-no-way-to-make-it-on-minimum-wage", "text": "In 'Maid,' A Single Mother Finds 'No Way' To Make It On Minimum Wage\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicol Biesek/Hachette Nicol Biesek/Hachette\n\nWhile raising her young daughter as a single mother, Stephanie Land cleaned houses through an agency to scrape by.

How?\n\nOn feeling like she knew the people whose homes she cleaned\n\nI knew them by the imprints they left in their bed. I knew them by the ring of coffee from their coffee mug that was always in the same place, or I knew them by what toothbrush they preferred, or what toothpaste or shampoo or just the act of them switching their shampoo. I kind of wondered like, \"Oh, I wondered why they do that?\" And it very much was a job where I got to know people just by the things that they left out on the counter. Not so much like their home decor or anything but just the little things that they did just in living \u2014 that was the interesting thing to me.\n\nOn expenses she accrued while cleaning houses\n\nI paid for my gas for the travel between houses, and this was in kind of a rural area, and sometimes the travel time between houses would be a half an hour, and I had to wash my own work rags, which meant driving to a laundromat and doing a few loads of laundry once a week. I was only allowed to work no more than six hours a day. [The agency] said after that I would be too tired and might injure myself.\n\nOn the difficulty of trying to get child care as a single parent\n\nThe Catch-22 ... is you have to have a job first, and you have to prove that you are employed \u2014 gainfully, regularly employed \u2014 and then you can get the voucher for a child care, depending on what your income is. And then you can go out to different day cares who accept that grant and see if they have an opening, which for a very young child is pretty rare, because it's just not affordable for day care centers to have [children] under 2 years old, which they still consider infants. So it's a lot of work to not only get the ability to go look for a day care center but then to find one, and if they have a full-time spot or Monday, Wednesday, Friday \u2014 it's a huge web of difficulty.\n\nOn how there's a disincentive to make more money or you'll lose benefits\n\nThere's a thing called a \"welfare cliff,\" and what happens is you get up to a threshold \u2014 which is a very firm line \u2014 and if you jump over it, then you lose all of your benefits. If there was a time that I made, I think, $50 more a month, and because of that I suddenly had a $50 copay for child care. So even though I was making more a month, I had to pay more. Food stamps is pretty abrupt as well. Like, if you go over the line, then you're suddenly not getting $200-$300 a month in assistance.\n\nOn calling the police on her daughter's father, who was abusive\n\nEmotional abuse is so invisible, and it's so confusing [because of] gaslighting. And it usually cuts you down to a point of nothingness. I felt so horrible about myself every second of the day, and he made me believe that I was mentally ill and that I was crazy. So to have a police officer validate what had happened and to have like a slip of paper with a case number on it \u2014 I carried that around for months because it was some kind of proof that I wasn't actually crazy, that this person was being truly horrible.\n\nOn living in an apartment that turned out to have black mold, which made her daughter, Mia, sick\n\nMia was very sick as a child. She had constant sinus infections, pinkeye, ear infections. She would come home sometimes and ... we would walk in and I'd look over at her and her eyes were just immediately red. ... I was constantly sick. I think it was just the wet, really damp climate. ...\n\nAs a parent you know you want to provide safe, healthy environments for your children. I had a doctor who I was taking Mia to, to be seen for yet another infection. She told me, \"You need to do better,\" and I just looked at her and I'm like, \"I can't.\" It was a defining moment for me \u2014 other people are telling me that I need to be a better mom. That was something that I already felt so horrible about.\n\nOn going back to school to study writing\n\nI decided to do the paralegal program, because I felt like I needed a job that would make me a contributing member of society and that I would have health insurance and the ability to hopefully pay for housing and child care and food all on my own. Writers are not notoriously a well-paid bunch, so I didn't think that that was really an option for me. But then once [I] ... started going to the University of Montana, which was my original plan ... I felt like if I went for the office job or I went for a job I wasn't totally happy with and then I wouldn't be a happy mother \u2014 and I wanted to pursue something that I had wanted to do since I was 10 years old. I felt like if I could possibly do that, then it would show Mia that she could do the same.\n\nSam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited the audio of this interview.

Ratings agencies have reduced its stock to \"junk\" status.\n\n\"We are fully committed to enhancing our wildfire safety efforts, as well as helping restoration and rebuilding efforts across the communities impacted by the devastating Northern California wildfires,\" Interim CEO John Simon said in a statement. \"To be clear, we have heard the calls for change and we are determined to take action throughout this process to build the energy system our customers want and deserve.\"\n\nChapter 11 \"is really the best way to deal comprehensively with all the liabilities they have,\" says University of California, Berkeley, law professor Ken Ayotte, an expert on corporate bankruptcy.\n\nThe bankruptcy of the state's largest utility is an early test for the new governor. Gavin Newsom released a statement today, saying the bankruptcy filing does not change his focus, \"which remains protecting the best interests of the people of California. My administration will continue working to ensure that Californians have access to safe, reliable and affordable service, that victims and employees are treated fairly, and that California continues to make forward progress on our climate change goals.\"\n\nA key hurdle for the company: In California, utilities can be held liable for wildfire damages if the company sparked the blaze regardless of whether they're found negligent.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alisa Barba/NPR Alisa Barba/NPR\n\nPG&E got a rare bit of good news last week when the state's fire agency said in a report that it does not think the company's equipment started a massive 2017 fire in wine country, which killed 22 people and did an estimated $10 billion in damage.\n\nBut that report is not the final word. And company still faces scores of lawsuits from other fires that year.\n\nIn addition, the state is still investigating whether PG&E is liable for 2018's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive blaze in state history.\n\nAyotte says the utility has to show Wall Street that the damages will come to an end through bankruptcy. \"It's really the only way for putting some kind of cap on the liabilities that come from these fires. It's going to continue to hang over their heads until they address it. So I think Chapter 11 makes a lot of sense here.\"\n\nBut to many fire victims, it doesn't make sense.\n\n\"When PG&E says, 'Oh safety is our most important priority.' No it's not. Their only priority is profits and more profits,\" says attorney Mike Danko, one of the many lawyers representing wildfire victims suing PG&E.\n\nDanko sees bankruptcy as a PG&E maneuver to get around paying for what he calls the company's long history of negligence and ineptitude, a history that Danko believes shows that PG&E is too big and too poorly managed to survive bankruptcy as is.\n\n\"Why do we have a for-profit company running a utility? You have to ask whether that model even works,\" he says.\n\nMeantime, Danko's clients are asking whether they'll get paid what they had hoped for if PG&E is found liable for starting the fire that destroyed their homes.\n\nBankruptcy expert Ayotte says given the pecking order of bankruptcy, fire survivors have reason to worry.\n\n\"The bankruptcy process says everyone gets paid fairly in accordance with their priority. But if you're an unsecured creditor \u2014 like a fire damage victim \u2014 it may mean that what comes out of the bankruptcy process may not mean 100 cents on the dollar in terms of full recovery.\"\n\nIt would likely then fall to the state legislature \u2014 and, by extension, taxpayers and ratepayers \u2014 to fill any gap and make fire victims whole.\n\nCalifornia State Sen. Bill Dodd called for a change in leadership and culture at PG&E.\n\n\"Given its track record of obfuscation and mismanagement, I'm not surprised PG&E claims it can no longer meet its financial obligations,\" he said in a statement. \"It's extremely disappointing and underscores the need for change at PG&E in both its leadership and culture. Wildfire victims shouldn't have to deal with the uncertainty this causes, which in many respects re-victimizes them.\"\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the filing \"a significant and unwelcome development\" and said the state's Department of Justice is \"prepared to protect the interests of the people of this great State.\"\n\nThere is no political appetite, as yet, for the state to step in or to take over some or all of the company's functions.\n\nBut some cities appear hungry. San Francisco's mayor has asked the city's Public Utilities Commission to explore buying PG&E's electricity assets and infrastructure in the city and transitioning to a public power supply.\n\nNPR first reported that PG&E has detailed plans underway to sell off its natural gas arm and potentially key real estate assets and use the proceeds to set up a wildfire compensation fund.\n\nWhether those plans move forward will now be up to a federal bankruptcy judge.\n\nThe advocacy group The Utility Reform Network voiced concern that ratepayers will be forced to pick up some of the costs of the company's reorganization.\n\n\"The message to customers is really bad here.

NPR's Tom Bowman weighs in.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAfter 17 years of war in Afghanistan, the United States wants out. And there now appears to be a framework for making that happen. But the Afghan central government hasn't been directly involved in these discussions. So far, the negotiations have been between the U.S. and the Taliban, which has left many Afghans worried about their future. Roya Rahmani is not one of them, though. She was recently appointed Afghanistan's first female ambassador to the U.S. And she is optimistic the U.S. will do right by her country. What is less clear to her is whether the Taliban is negotiating in good faith.\n\nDo you trust the Taliban negotiators?\n\nROYA RAHMANI: I haven't been at the table to be able to directly respond to this. However, what I could say is that our people has demonstrated the generosity to let go of the past and to let go of the grievances as a price for peace. And they are willing to come in terms. There is one other thing also - that Afghanistan is a changed place. The resolve to democracy is one of our highest values. I will quickly share with you something that really moved me when I visited Afghanistan after parliamentary election, and that was that a taxi driver sacrificed seven hours of his income earning hours while he is responsible for feeding four of his children at home in order to cast his vote. That shows there is resolve to democracy - our resolve to the values that we have earned. And Afghanistan's nation, a changed nation now, has different standing and aspiration today. So whatever the outcome, it has to cater to that.\n\nMARTIN: What happens to Afghanistan's young democracy if the Taliban is either incorporated into a power-sharing agreement or, at the very least, legitimized through this peace plan?\n\nRAHMANI: The Taliban, if part of the Afghan society, they can certainly participate in the democratic processes. We have laid out a very clear roadmap towards peace on how we could go about this. And we are hoping to be able to unroll that. That will specify the rules, and they are most welcome to join and be part of the power sharing, stand for election, have people vote for them. This is their right like every other Afghan citizens' right.\n\nMARTIN: You are the first woman to serve as ambassador from Afghanistan to the United States. Are you concerned that if the Taliban is incorporated into government, if the Taliban is legitimized, that all those advances for minorities in Afghanistan - for women in particular - are you concerned that they will be reversed?\n\nRAHMANI: Rachel, I don't believe that Afghanistan could fall back. We are a changed nation. There is a shift in the mindset. Let me give you an example. I have met a soldier who has joined our forces simply because he has two daughters. And he will not agree that his daughters will not go to school. That's the reason he told me he joined our forces. Afghanistan is a changed place, and this is why that there is more to a peaceful Afghanistan to offer to all its partners as a partner - not as a dependent - in the foreseeable future.\n\nMARTIN: At some point if the peace talks continue, you as an ambassador, I would imagine, would have occasion to be in a meeting with a Taliban leader. Would they even tolerate your presence there considering their subjugation of women? I mean, it's one thing for you to say you believe that Afghanistan is moving forward, but the Taliban have not conceded that at all. They still maintain the same views about women's place in society.\n\nRAHMANI: Well, that question is for them to answer. But at the same time, let's not forget if I am at the table like many other women, I will be representing half of my population. If - no deal would be acceptable if it ignores half of our population.\n\nMARTIN: Ambassador Roya Rahmani, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nRAHMANI: Thank you very much.\n\nMARTIN: She is Afghanistan's ambassador to the U.S., the first woman to serve in that role. NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman was listening in to that conversation and joins me now. Good morning, Tom.\n\nTOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: So Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad is the special envoy leading the U.S. in these peace talks. He insists - Khalilzad does - that nothing is for sure until the Afghan central government signs off on it. But how likely is that?\n\nBOWMAN: Well, right, that's what he said. It's important to note, Rachel, we're in the very early stages of this process. The Taliban have yet to agree even to sit down with the Afghan government. That's what really has to happen. And that's what the Afghan government is demanding, and so is the U.S. government. Now, the Taliban say before they sit down with the Afghan government, they want a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. Meanwhile, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says the rights of the Afghan people will not be compromised in the name of peace. So that clearly means making sure the rights of women are assured, that women can work outside the home, girls can go to school and so forth. But again, we're sort of at a stalemate a little bit here, you know, because the Taliban want that timetable withdrawal of U.S. troops before they sit down with the Afghan government.\n\nMARTIN: Right, and...\n\nBOWMAN: Again, there's a lot that has to be done here.\n\nMARTIN: I mean, we heard a lot of optimism in the ambassador's voice there. But what is to prevent the Taliban from overthrowing the Afghan government once the U.S. is gone?\n\nBOWMAN: Well, that's of great concern of people within the Afghan government who just don't trust the Taliban and are wary of any deal and, of course, are concerned that the U.S. will leave abruptly. President Trump has said he'll pull about 7,000 troops out. That's half the number there now.\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nBOWMAN: So again, there's a great concern within the Afghan government about whether you can even trust the Taliban.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman.

That 10 percent increase \"is the biggest price increase by total cents in the history of the Postal Service,\" according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Postal Service has been running a multibillion-dollar deficit for years, and the price increase is an attempt to contend with a United States that just doesn't send as many letters as it used to.\n\nThe Postal Service lost $3.9 billion in 2018. First-class mail volume decreased by about 2.1 billion pieces. People are using different methods to send messages and money, Postmaster General Megan Brennan said. \"The flawed business model imposed by law continues to be the root cause of our financial instability.\" According to USA Today, \"it was the 12th year in a row the agency reported a loss despite growth in package shipping.\"\n\nIt also will cost more to send a package using priority mail. The price of a small box rose from $7.20 to $7.90; a medium box increases from $13.65 to $14.35. This could have a real effect on Postal Service revenue. While first-class mail delivery has fallen, the Postal Service's package business has grown. The year 2018 saw an increase of almost half a billion additional packages compared with the year before. President Trump once called out the Postal Service for charging too little to deliver packages. \"Should be charging MUCH MORE!\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThere is some good news for consumers: The cost of a postcard will stay the same, at 35 cents, and the cost per additional letter ounce is decreasing from 21 cents to 15 cents. So, if you're about to send wedding invitations to your 200 closest friends, the good news is that you'll save $2.\n\nForever Stamps were introduced in 2007 to make life easier for people who didn't want to contend with adding 1- and 2-cent stamps to their mail every time the Postal Service increased prices. By 2011, most first-class stamps in the U.S. had become so-called Forever Stamps. They can always be used to mail a 1-ounce letter, no matter how much prices might increase in the future.\n\nSome on Twitter have idly wondered whether the Postal Service has created a moneymaking opportunity for those who might wish to buy low and sell to others when the price of stamps inevitably goes up again. But that strategy is unlikely to be successful, writes Washington Post columnist Allan Sloan.\n\n\"You shouldn't treat Forevers as an investment because they don't produce any current income and those of us who are average postal customers can't buy or sell them in enough quantity to make any serious money.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/25/688839422/the-invisibles-looks-at-some-of-the-jews-who-survived-the-holocaust-in-berlin", "text": "'The Invisibles' Looks At Some Of The Jews Who Survived The Holocaust In Berlin\n\nThe Invisibles looks at an under-reported aspect of the Holocaust.

NPR's Eleanor Beardsley met one of them and sends this report.\n\nELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hanni Weissenberg, now Hanni Levy, survived the war by hiding in the capital of Nazi Germany. Early in the movie, we meet her as a 17-year-old, sitting in her Berlin apartment with the Gestapo pounding on the door.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE INVISIBLES\")\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (Shouting in German).\n\nHANNI LEVY: (Through interpreter) That's when I knew it was now or never. It was time to disappear. When they knocked like that, usually you had to open. But I didn't.\n\nBEARDSLEY: Levy slipped out of the apartment and escaped the roundup that day. She had been living alone after her parents died of illness, working in a factory sewing parachutes. In February 1943, the Nazis rounded up and deported the last Jewish forced laborers like Levy. After her escape, she found refuge with friends of her parents, removed the yellow star the Nazis forced Jews to wear, dyed her hair blond and began a new life as Hannelore Winkler.\n\nLEVY: (Through interpreter) You just had to push away your fear and become someone else. I had to try to lose myself in the masses and forget that I was scared and that I had been subject to the Nazi race laws. I had to act like a regular Berliner, and this is what saved me in the end.\n\nKELLY: Barbara Schieb is a historian with the German Resistance Memorial Center. She says in occupied countries Jews often went underground and were sometimes helped by resistance movements. But for Jews in Berlin, where potentially everyone was a Nazi and there was no organized resistance, people hid in plain sight, relying on the help of German friends.\n\nBARBARA SCHIEB: They just said, I'm somebody else. They invented a new Aryan-sounding identity. And for this, they needed helpers. They needed a home, something to eat, money, of course. They needed false documents. They were visible. You see it in the film quite well.\n\nBEARDSLEY: \"The Invisibles\" director is Claus Rafle, a veteran filmmaker.\n\nCLAUS RAFLE: I made this film because I thought these stories of people who have to hide them self in their own town and to have to climb into different identities, these stories are so full of tension and emotions because every day is full of risks.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBEARDSLEY: As the film ends, Hanni Levy takes the stage for Q-and-A with a rapt audience.\n\nLEVY: (Foreign language spoken).\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PHOTOGRAPHER #1: Levy?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PHOTOGRAPHER #2: Levy?\n\nBEARDSLEY: And she poses for pictures with Michael Muller, the mayor of Berlin.\n\nMICHAEL MULLER: (Foreign language spoken).\n\nBEARDSLEY: \"It's great to have Levy's optimism and energy,\" Muller says. \"She helps us account for our difficult past and learn for the future.\"\n\nMARIANNE ENZENSBERGER: I adore this lady, that she can forgive everybody. I would never be able to do that.\n\nBEARDSLEY: That's 72-year-old Marianne Enzensberger, who is not Jewish. She's just watched the film with her friend, Marianne Rosenberg, whose father was Jewish and survived Auschwitz. Both women say they're worried about the rise of the far-right in Germany and Eastern Europe today.\n\nENZENSBERGER: I'm very angry - angry about what's happening in that German people, I mean, they say, it's so many years ago it happened.

However, previous surveys have shown that providing more scientific facts about GMOs to people doesn't change their minds.\n\nThe survey, conducted by four universities, asked 2,000 people in Europe and the United States how much they knew about genetically modified food, what their opinion was and how intense it was.\n\nThen it went on to ask a series of true-or-false questions about science, ranging from basic issues like whether the core of the Earth is hot or cold to questions on genetics, like \"Does a non-genetically modified tomato have genes?\"\n\nThe results showed the more strongly people reported being opposed to GMOs, the lower their test score.\n\n\"A lot of people are upset by genetically modified food,\" said Sydney Scott, a marketing professor at Washington University in St. Louis, one of the schools that ran the study.\n\n\"We have to get people to recognize gaps in their knowledge before we try to teach them new things and have a meaningful discussion,\" she added.\n\nOpponents of genetically modified food are not putting much stock in the study.\n\n\"The real flawed science is that the Food and Drug Administration is not rigorously testing genetically modified food,\" said Alexis Baden-Mayer, political director for the anti-GMO Organic Consumers Association.\n\nShe said her organization wants to see a \"thorough scientific review of genetically modified food using up-to-date testing practices.\"\n\nScott said Baden-Mayer has a point and reinforced that the study was about the correlation of scientific knowledge and consumer behavior, not just the science of GMOs. But, she said, consumers often are less likely to learn the facts when it's something they feel very passionate about, \"especially if they feel like it's challenging their moral values.\"\n\n\"So people might feel extremely about genetically modified food because it's very unnatural in a way they find almost morally upsetting,\" Scott said.\n\nResearchers at the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Toronto and the University of Pennsylvania also participated in the study, which was primarily paid for by grants from the National Science Foundation.\n\nThey plan to follow up with more studies on how the findings may play into other controversial science issues including vaccinations, nuclear power and homeopathic medicine.\n\nThis story comes to us from Harvest Public Media, a reporting collaboration focused on food and agriculture.

Eslah Attar created this series of instant film portraits during her time working at NPR in 2018.\n\nCreating a moment of connection is often the most difficult part of making a photograph: It has to happen in the instant the shutter clicks. Photographing performers can be even harder, since they naturally create personas as part of their work. So in photographing some of the musicians who have come to NPR to play Tiny Desk concerts, I wanted to find a way to capture them in a more natural state.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eslah Attar/NPR Eslah Attar/NPR\n\nI find that using an instant film camera often disarms the people I photograph. It's familiar, nostalgic, almost a toy, so it doesn't intimidate in the same way a professional camera does \u2014 which helps break down some of the barriers that usually exist between photographers and their subjects. It is also limiting: For these portraits I took only one or two shots of each artist, leaving little time to warm up to the situation or try out different poses. The moment happens quickly, and the imperfections are part of the result.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eslah Attar/NPR Eslah Attar/NPR\n\nSeeing these artists perform at the Tiny Desk before I photographed them helped me get a more intimate idea of who they were.

Tom Hanks described driving a Volkswagen camper van on one of those highways:\n\n\"No matter how fast you're driving in Germany, someone is driving faster than you,\" Hanks once said on Late Show with David Letterman. \"When another car passes you when you're driving as fast as physics allow ... a blur goes past you. Sometimes it's a red blur, sometimes it's white.\"\n\nNow that may change. The transportation minister convened a panel to find ways to cut carbon emissions from transportation. The panel's working paper leaked to the German press last weekend, and one proposal was to impose a speed limit on the stretches of autobahn that don't have them.\n\nQuicker than a passing German car, Transportation Minister Andreas Scheuer changed gears. A speed limit was \"against all common sense,\" the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported him saying. Then he canceled the working group's next scheduled meeting.\n\nThere are more than 8,000 miles of autobahn in Germany, and about 70 percent have no limits on speed, according to the Federal Highway Research Institute, though other roads and freeways do have restrictions. Whether to force drivers to slow down on all sections of autobahn is a perennial debate with entrenched opponents: in one lane, the powerful car industry and its allies in government; in the opposing direction, environmentalists and safety advocates. The Handelsblatt newspaper compared the fever pitch of the public discussion to Americans' polarized views on gun control and abortion.\n\nThe latest iteration of the speed limit idea emerged out of the National Platform on the Future of Mobility, a government committee tasked with finding ways to reduce carbon emissions from transportation, Reuters reports. The committee's ideas include a 130 kph [81 mph] speed limit on the unrestricted stretches of autobahn and a fuel tax hike, as well as the end of tax breaks for diesel cars, according to Reuters. When asked to provide further details, the panel declined to answer NPR's emailed questions.\n\nThe Green party supports the proposal. So does the national police union. On Friday, the police union's deputy leader, Michael Mertens, compared his country with neighboring Austria and estimated that Germany could prevent at least 1 in 4 deaths by imposing a limit on all its roads.\n\n\"In this country, some people legally drive 200 or 250 kilometers per hour [124 to 155 mph],\" Mertens told Sueddeutsche Zeitung. \"To be clear, that's crazy. At this rate nobody can control their car in stressful situations.\"\n\nBy comparison, there is no U.S. road system without speed limits, Joe Young at the Ruckersville, Va.-based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, told NPR. Young said even Germany's proposed limit of around 80 mph is high, and only a handful of mostly rural American states including Texas, Montana, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming let their drivers go that fast.\n\nThe German Association of the Automotive Industry called the speed limit proposal \"a purely symbolic policy\" without a clear climate or traffic safety payoff. In a statement to NPR, spokesman Eckehart Rotter wrote that speed limits would only shave 1 percent of carbon emissions. He suggested digitizing road traffic and introducing electric vehicles would do more for both climate and safety.\n\nAn anti-speed limit group says it has collected 50,000 signatures.\n\n\"A speed limit in Germany is only another screw in an ideology-driven system that has one goal: to destroy the car in Germany in the future,\" the group writes.\n\nJack Ewing, author of Faster, Higher, Farther: The Volkswagen Scandal, said the autobahn culture burnishes the reputation of Germany's automotive industry.\n\n\"Carmakers will tell you that demanding German drivers are why German cars are so good,\" Ewing, who is also a New York Times reporter, told NPR. \"Their home market is in fact very demanding in terms of quality and performance. That's kind of in a way a proving ground for Daimler, BMW and Audi, and it helped make them successful abroad.\"\n\nEmissions from transportation have crept up since 1990, according to government figures. In recent years, Germany has taken measures to limit pollution from cars. Hamburg banned diesels from the city's center, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports, although residents of the city worried it would decrease business without cutting down smog. Germany has also considered offering free public transportation in cities to bring down car use, NPR's Laurel Wamsley reports.\n\nMoves like this have triggered battles over German identity. The far-right Alternative for Deutschland party has adopted a \"No diesel is illegal\" slogan to rally its supporters. The AfD also opposes the newest package of proposals to impose speed limits and raise taxes on fuel and prices on fuel-inefficient cars. Federal AfD lawmaker Dirk Spaniel of the car-producing state of Baden-Wuerttenberg accused the committee of forcing citizens to buy certain products. \"This is a planned economy instead of a market economy,\" Spaniel writes.\n\nIn neighboring France, President Emmanuel Macron was forced to eliminate a fuel tax hike aimed at reducing carbon emissions after yellow vest protesters took to the streets in violent demonstrations, reports NPR's Eleanor Beardsley.\n\nEwing said recent events may make Germans more receptive to speed limits despite previous opposition. The Volkswagen emissions scandal has raised the issue of air quality in cities. And Germany risks fines if it does not meet EU targets for greenhouse gas emissions. A survey published last year in Germany by the CosmosDirekt insurer found that 52 percent of respondents supported a speed limit. The staunchest opponents were the youngest drivers, aged 18-29.\n\nSo far, the transportation changes exist only as a working paper. A final version is reportedly expected in March.\n\nAnnalena Baerbock, co-chair of the Green party, told NPR that Americans are proof that a speed limit will not ding Germany's car industry.\n\n\"The U.S. \u2014 in whose states a speed limit applies on all highways \u2014 has reliably imported German luxury cars for decades,\" Baerbock said."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/26/687957536/lgbt-navajos-discover-unexpected-champions-their-grandparents", "text": "LGBT Navajos Discover Unexpected Champions: Their Grandparents\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Laurel Morales/KJZZ Laurel Morales/KJZZ\n\nWhen she was 5 years old, Michelle Sherman learned exactly what her mother thought of gay men.\n\n\"I remember seeing two guys holding hands, and then my mom's like, 'Oh, that's disgusting,' and so I was like, 'OK, maybe it is disgusting,' \" Sherman says.\n\nBut then she realized she was attracted to girls and began to believe something was wrong with her too. At just 11 years old, Sherman attempted suicide.\n\nNationwide, the share of gay, lesbian and bisexual teens who attempt suicide is high \u2014 23 percent. For Navajo LGBTQ youth, the rate is 70 percent, according to the Navajo Nation's Din\u00e9 Policy Institute.\n\nThrough her teens, Sherman tried to fit in on the northern edge of the Navajo Nation, but she was living a double life. When she was 19 years old, her sister walked in on Sherman and another female in her bedroom.\n\n\"She just barged in the door and, you know, yelled at me like, 'What the hell are you doing?' Like you shouldn't be doing this,\" Sherman says. \"You know, [she] made me feel less human. Cuz she was like, 'What do you think Grandma's going to think about you?' \"\n\nThat's when Sherman felt she had to leave the reservation and her family. She moved to Phoenix and began drinking heavily.

They watch wrestling, grind corn and go to flea markets.\n\nA time before prejudice\n\nIt's not unusual that Navajo grandparents are accepting of being LGBT while parents are not. Historians say federally run boarding schools and other assimilation tactics taught a generation of Navajos that same-sex relationships are wrong.\n\nNavajo leadership also plays a role \u2014 in 2005 the tribal council passed the Din\u00e9 Marriage Act, a law forbidding same-sex marriage.\n\n\"When I came out to my family, my mother of course took it the hardest. But my grandparents didn't,\" says Alray Nelson, a Navajo LGBT rights activist.\n\n\"We are seeing clearly the aftereffects of what colonialism can look like and how it really shifted our values as Navajo people,\" Nelson says. \"Whereas at the time, if you were LGBTQ and growing up in Navajo traditional families, families celebrated that fact. They said that we were sacred. They said that we had sacred roles.\"\n\nWhen I came out to my family, my mother of course took it the hardest. But my grandparents didn't.\n\nBut returning to understandings that predate colonialism has helped the families of LGBT Navajos. Traditionalists believe that the \"two spirited,\" as they're sometimes called, are powerful and that not all humans can be classified as male or female.\n\nNavajo historian Jennifer Denetdale says the Din\u00e9 creation story includes a n\u00e1dleeh\u00ed.\n\n\"Today we take the n\u00e1dleeh\u00ed as a being who was what we would call an intersex person today, meaning that this is a person who has sexual organs of the male and the female and is considered to be a third gender in Navajo society,\" Denetdale says.\n\nWhen the first man and the first woman weren't getting along, it was the n\u00e1dleeh\u00ed who intervened.\n\nFinding a purpose\n\nIn Michelle Sherman's family, her grandmother has persuaded other family members to open their minds. Even Michelle's mother, Virgie Sherman, agreed to go with her last June to the Din\u00e9 Pride festival, where Michelle gave a speech.\n\n\"I was there for her,\" Virgie says. \"She can talk to [the] audience. She wasn't even embarrassed about what she is. Yeah, so I'm proud of her.\"\n\nNow 33, Michelle is working on her bachelor's degree at Haskell Indian Nations University. When she graduates, she plans to return to the Navajo Nation, where LGBT youth often don't have access to resources, let alone the Internet.\n\n\"If I want to keep inspiring, then why not do it at home?\" Michelle says. \"Just like my grandma, she's here. She still inspires people.\"\n\nMichelle looks down at her forearm, where she has tattooed a black diamond, the same design her grandmother used to weave into rugs. On the other side of her arm are scars from her suicide attempt, reminding her every day that she is still here, that she has a purpose: to help Navajo youth like herself."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/26/688326707/trinidadian-kids-taken-away-to-isis-reunite-with-mom-thanks-to-help-from-a-rock-", "text": "Trinidadian Mom Reunites With Kids Taken By Their Father To ISIS\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ruth Sherlock/NPR Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n\nFelicia Perkins-Ferreira cried while recounting how her two young sons were taken by their father from home in Trinidad to live under the Islamic State in the Middle East.\n\nShe had a blanket stitched out of their school uniforms and other clothes for comfort. She became plagued by panic attacks and exhaustion. \"Every time I fell asleep, I'd dream that my children were there beside me,\" she said. But they were gone. It was too much to bear. \"So I just preferred not to sleep.\"\n\nNow that agony is over. After four years of surviving life under ISIS, through war and in a detention camp in northeastern Syria, Mahmud and Ayyub \u2014 ages 11 and 7 \u2014 finally returned home to Trinidad this week, following an extraordinary intervention by their mother along with a renowned human rights lawyer and an international rock star.\n\nRoger Waters, a founding member of the band Pink Floyd, brought his celebrity power to help overcome many of the obstacles involved in securing the release of an ISIS fighter's children and flying them back to their Caribbean homeland.\n\n\"A mother and a couple of kids separated. It's simple; you have to put them back together,\" Waters told NPR, which, alongside The Guardian newspaper, was given exclusive access to the rescue mission.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ruth Sherlock/NPR Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n\nWaters said he decided to help these children after hearing about their situation from Clive Stafford Smith, a longtime friend who heads the nonprofit human rights group Reprieve. The organization is known for its efforts to help people wrongly detained and to close the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison.\n\nThe rock star chartered a private jet in Switzerland, which flew Perkins-Ferreira on the final leg of her long journey from the Caribbean to Iraq. And then Stafford Smith and Waters hatched a plan to get the children out of neighboring Syria.\n\n\"I still won't believe this, I still won't be able to relax until my children are with me, home,\" Perkins-Ferreira said, looking out the jet window at snowcapped mountains below. The trip out of Trinidad was her first time flying.\n\nThe boys' Trinidadian father took them to Syria in 2014, when the younger son Ayyub had just turned 3. Perkins-Ferreira said she and the father were still married but separated. He came to her house, in a suburb of Trinidad's capital Port of Spain, supposedly to take the children for a day out.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ruth Sherlock/NPR Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n\n\"He told Mahmud and Ayyub to tell me they loved me,\" she recalled. Then, the boys and their dad disappeared. Her estranged husband would not answer calls or messages. She says she didn't hear from him for several months, until she got a call from Syria.\n\nFor four years, the only contacts Ferreira-Perkins had with her sons were sporadic phone conversations and grainy video calls. \"If I tried to ask where they were in Syria or tell him to bring my children back, he'd cut the line and I wouldn't get to speak to my children for weeks,\" she said.\n\nThe boys lived in the Syrian city of Raqqa, which served as the capital of ISIS territory, until U.S.-led coalition forces launched a heavy assault on the city and took control in October 2017.\n\nTheir father then gave the children to a Belgian woman whom he had married in Syria, asking that she take them with her as she tried to flee toward Turkey.\n\nWhat happened next is unclear, but in 2017, Kurdish militiamen eventually found the boys abandoned on a road and took them to a camp that holds foreign women and children of ISIS. The Roj camp is one of three shelters in northeastern Syria that hold more than 550 foreign women and over 1,200 foreign children, who face an uncertain future, with many of their governments unwilling to take them back.\n\nAn American detainee at the Roj camp, Samantha Marie Elhassani, also known as Samantha Sally, looked after the boys.\n\nLast summer, after the Syrian Democratic Forces transferred Elhassani to U.S. custody, she was charged with terrorism crimes.\n\nThe boys were so traumatized and so young after being taken from Trinidad that they didn't remember their mother's name. But in a meeting with Stafford Smith, Elhassani passed him a photograph of Perkins-Ferreira that she had found among their possessions.\n\nStafford Smith enlisted the help of a Guardian journalist, who eventually tracked down Perkins-Ferreira in Trinidad.\n\nAfter securing the children's emergency passports from the government of Trinidad and Tobago, Stafford Smith needed to persuade the authorities of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan government in northern Iraq to let the boys cross the border.\n\nKurdistan officials said privately that they feared angering allies in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, which have so far largely refused to engage with their citizens held in Syrian camps and have in some cases responded by stripping their nationals of citizenship.\n\nThere were also concerns that allowing the two young children to cross the border from Syria could set a precedent of northern Iraq becoming a route out of Syria for the hundreds of detained ISIS families.\n\n\"I chose to help these children because when I met them in the camp, they were weeping and said what they wanted for Christmas was to hug Mummy,\" said Stafford Smith.\n\nHe is campaigning for the governments of other foreign detainees in Syria to allow their citizens to return. \"If governments want to prosecute their national[s] when they go home, then be my guest, do that, absolutely. But what you can't do is forget history and say that we can just find everyone guilty and leave them in the camp,\" he said. \"That's the mistake ... with Guant\u00e1namo.\" He said U.S. detentions without trial have led to more extremism.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ruth Sherlock/NPR Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n\nTouching down in Iraq, Stafford Smith used Waters' fame to secure high-level meetings with officials from the Kurdish regional government to talk about Mahmud and Ayyub's plight. Waters praised the \"humanity\" of the region's officials to Falah Mustafa Bakir, the head of the foreign relations department, as the two men conversed, sitting in ornate, gold-painted chairs beside large Kurdish and Iraqi flags. The glad-handing mission then included a tour of the old citadel in the Kurdish city of Irbil.\n\nWith the requisite permissions approved, Stafford Smith and Perkins-Ferreira made the journey into Syria on Monday. They traveled to Qamishli, where they would meet the boys in an administrative building for the Syrian Democratic Council, the Kurdish authorities there.\n\nPerkins-Ferreira was hoping for a quiet reunion, to hug her children in private after the long separation, but the Kurdish authorities in Syria wanted to promote their decision to release the children to their mother.\n\nThe reunion turned into a media frenzy. Seeing Mahmud and Ayyub for the first time in four years, Perkins-Ferreira and the boys cried and she hugged them close to her. She seemed intimidated as dozens of journalists crowded the family with cameras and microphones.\n\nWearing new coats that Perkins-Ferreira had brought for them, the family traveled back to the Iraqi border. On the car ride, they slept deeply, Mahmud and Ayyub nestling their heads on their mom's lap.\n\nBut the challenges were not over yet. After the group crossed the Tigris River between the countries, Iraqi border officials held the family for two hours and then escorted them to a security office in the northern Iraqi town of Dohuk.\n\nThere, under the bright fluorescent strip lights of the police office, they waited for several more hours, as security officials asked them questions and waited for the final clearance from Irbil that they could pass through Iraq.\n\n\"Do you know what your father did in ISIS?\" a police officer asked 7-year-old Ayyub. \"Do you speak Arabic now?\" he asked 11-year-old Mahmud.\n\nThe boys do speak Arabic. But afraid and exhausted, they ignored the questions, keeping their heads down and playing a game on their mother's phone.\n\nIn the police station, as the hours ticked by, Mahmud began to sob, suffering from a pounding headache. Perkins-Ferreira held him close. Ayyub drew a picture of a house on a piece of paper. \"This is my house in Trinidad,\" he told his mom. \"It's where I want to go.\"\n\nBack in a hotel in Irbil, Waters grew anxious and frustrated. \"What's going on? Why are they doing this? They're traveling with their mother! With birth certificates, with passports!\" he fumed to Kurdish officials.\n\nThe officials tried to appease him, making calls to resolve the delay. Late in the evening, the authorization finally came through. After kind apologies and dinner, we continued on to Irbil, arriving after 1 a.m.\n\nWaters greeted the boys in Irbil with large hugs. \"Get these children to bed!\" he said. The children and Perkins-Ferreira went to a suite in the hotel he had booked for them.\n\nPerkins-Ferreira said that before the trip, she had not heard any songs by Waters or Pink Floyd. \"I am going to check [your music] out myself,\" she told him in a conversation during the rescue effort. \"I'm going to be in the shower, shaking,\" she said, using a slang expression for dancing."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/01/26/688168838/how-teenage-sisters-pushed-bali-to-say-bye-bye-to-plastic-bags", "text": "How Teenage Sisters Pushed Bali To Say 'Bye-Bye' To Plastic Bags\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alexander Koerner/Getty Images Alexander Koerner/Getty Images\n\nFive years ago, two young women decided they were going to do something about the plastic problem on their island of Bali.\n\nAnd Bye Bye Plastic Bags was born.\n\nHow young? So young one of them couldn't make it to our midweek interview. \"She's at school,\" explained 18-year-old Melati Wijsen, talking about her 16- year- old sister Isabel.\n\n\"She's just halfway through grade 11 and she's putting her focus more into graduating high school.\"\n\nAbout 'The Plastic Tide' NPR is exploring one of the most important environmental issues of our time: plastic waste. Click here to read more about the topic.\n\nBali is part of the island nation of Indonesia, which is the world's second biggest polluter when it comes to marine plastic, trailing only China. And when ocean currents carry that plastic to the tourist island of Bali, it's a public relations nightmare. This video taken by British diver Rich Horner last year pretty much sums up the scale of the problem as he tries to navigate through a sea of plastic just below the water's surface.\n\nThe two sisters got the idea for Bye Bye Plastic Bags in 2013 after a lesson at school about influential world leaders \u2014 change-makers \u2014 including Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n\"My sister and I went home that day thinking, 'Well, what can we do as kids living on the island of Bali?' \" Melati Wijsen says.\n\n\"You see, we didn't want to wait until we were older to start making a difference. It wasn't even a question, really. It was more like, what can we do, as kids, right now.\"\n\nThe answer was right in front of them. Literally. On the beach in front of their home.\n\n\"It got to the point where on weekends when we would go to our childhood beach, if we went swimming there, a plastic bag would wrap around your arm, Wijsen says. \"And you say just, enough is enough.\"\n\nThey went online and discovered that over 40 countries had already banned or taxed plastic bags.\n\n\"We thought, 'Well, if they can do it, c'mon, Bali! C'mon, Indonesia! We can do it, too!' \" Wijsen says. \"So, without a business plan or a strategy or a budget, like my mom will tell you, we went forward with a pure passion and intention to make our island home plastic bag free.\"\n\nThey got some friends together, went online to start a petition and got 6,000 signatures in less than a day, Wijsen says. They spread awareness through school and community workshops. The organized massive beach cleanup campaigns, all the while drawing international attention and that of local politicians too. Especially when they decided to up the ante optics-wise.\n\n\"I think one of the biggest tools that pushed us forward was our decision to go on a food strike,\" Wijsen says, inspired, she says, by one of the tools used by Gandhi. \"He also had peaceful ways of reaching his goals, of getting attention, So that was a huge inspiration for us.\"\n\nThe sisters put the word out about their plan on social media. Local media picked it up, and that's prompted the governor at the time, I Made Pastika, to do what any savvy politician would do when faced with two teenage girls threatening a hunger strike. He invited them to come see him. \"Within 24 hours, we had a phone call and then the next day we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor,\" Wijsen says.\n\nPastika signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the sisters to work toward eliminating plastic on the island \u2014 and later pledged to rid Bali of plastic bags by 2018. That didn't happen, but the sisters kept engaging government at every level \u2014 local, municipal and national \u2014 to keep up the pressure. Melati Wijsen says she learned a lot about dealing with politicians in the process.\n\n\"Yeah, well, being 14 and skipping school on a Tuesday because I had to learn about draft regulations and suggestions really was an interesting learning curve for me,\" she says. Dancing with politicians, she says, is like three steps forward, two steps back and again, and again. It's almost like the cha-cha. I learned a lot of different things.\"\n\nWijsen says that in the past year she's spent about 100 nights on the road with speaking engagements to get out the anti-plastic message and to talk about youth empowerment as well. The sisters have given a TED talk, spoke at the U.N. in New York and again last year at the IMF World Bank Forum in Bali. World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva called Melati \"a girl that is changing the world around her.\"\n\nThey've also been named among the world's most influential teenagers by Forbes, Time magazine and CNN.\n\nAnd just last month, the new governor of Bali announced a law banning single-use plastic in 2019, thanks in part to the sisters' efforts and those of like-minded NGOs.\n\nBusinesses have six months to comply or face having their business permits revoked.\n\nMelati Wijsen was thrilled with the news. But she says there's still lots of work to be done spreading the no-plastic gospel not just in Bali and Indonesia but around the globe.\n\nSo Bye Bye Plastic Bags is multiplying. \"We're actually now in 28 locations around the world, and it's all led by young people,\" Wijsen says. \"We've created a starter kit and a handbook that guides them through this process of how to start a movement.\"\n\nShe says this global expansion is one of the most inspiring parts of being part of Bye Bye Plastic Bags \"because ... we literally prove that kids can do things, and Bye Bye Plastic Bags has become this platform where kids can feel like their voices are being heard.\"\n\nShe wants to continue being heard \u2014 and demanding change. And she wants other young people to do the same: \"For us, everything is happening in our lifetime, right? So we have to be the ones to start working toward the future and the world that we want to be a part of.\"\n\nIn addition to efforts in Bali, the Indonesian government has pledged to do its part in eliminating the scourge of plastic pollution. It's committed to reducing plastic pollution by 70 percent by 2025. Melati Wijsen will be closely monitoring their efforts.\n\nShe's graduated from high school but is committed to her campaign: \"This is my No. 1 focus right now,\" she says. \"It consumes almost every thought in my body. I mean, it's like a full-time job.\"\n\nIs she obsessed or just focused? \"A healthy chunk of both,\" she says, laughing, adding that her mother helps keep her balanced. \"Some days, she'll just be like, 'Melati, take a day off, like go to the beach with your friends and just don't pick up the plastic, just sit there.' \" She is going to the beach \u2014 on Feb. 16, when Bye Bye Plastic Bags is planning its biggest beach cleanup ever."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/11/18/565025419/the-longevity-economy-what-does-it-mean-to-be-old", "text": "What Does It Mean To Be Old? Products Geared Toward Older People Are Hit-Or-Miss\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Larry Crowe/ASSOCIATED PRESS Larry Crowe/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWhen people create products designed with older folks in mind, the same mistake is made over and over again. Businesses tend to jump to conclusions regarding products older people may need, that is: equating age with disability.\n\nAs Joseph Coughlin, founder of the AgeLab at MIT, puts it in his new book, The Longevity Economy, businesses are more focused on helping older adults \"stay alive\" rather than \"live their lives.\" According to Kaufman, companies are relying on an incorrect story about who older consumers are.\n\n\"It's a narrative that says we're old, we're frail and by the way, we don't like anything new. And as a result we don't make things that excite and delight,\" Kaufman says.\n\nThe older population is growing and has a strong spending power. One in five people in the United States will be 65 years or older by the year 2030. In 2015, people over 50 years-old spent $750 billion more than those under 50.\n\nWith flawed design and marketing tactics, some businesses have missed the mark attempting to appeal to our older population.\n\nHere are four products included in Kaufman's new book, ranked from \"Bad\" to \"Great\" for old people:\n\nBAD: \"Senior Foods\"\n\nBasically, baby food for older folks. It was geared for people with tight budgets and bad teeth. According to Kaufman, it looked gross and tasted gross. Plus, at the checkout line, it announced to everyone you were old, broke and had bad teeth. Unsurprisingly, no one really wanted to buy the product.\n\nGOOD: Arthritis-geared products\n\nManufacturer OXO Good Grips designed a peeler and various other kitchen tools for people with arthritis. It turns out, however, that these products are comfortable and appealing for many people, even if they do not have arthritis.\n\nGOOD: Tablet computer\n\nAs Kaufman says, a tablet computer is a great device because it can be personalized. Although the older generation may not be a tablet's target audience, it has still been successful with this population.\n\n\"Without my glasses, I can't see my hand, let alone the text in front of me,\" Kaufman says. \"But the tablet that I use allows me to use my fingers and to jack up that font so that I can see it. It is not a device that yells: 'Old man who can't see.' It is a device that is so profoundly personalized, that it allows me to use it at any age.\"\n\nGREAT: \"Champagne popper\"\n\nTwo cousins developed this device for a champagne-loving neighbor, whose arthritis was preventing her from getting the cork out and enjoying her favorite beverage. They developed a device that was a curvy wrench with a long handle.\n\nSome people, like NPR's very own Ina Jaffe, have never been able to open a champagne bottle.

Richard Hellmeier. They were \"playing with firearms\" when Hendren produced a revolver, emptied the cylinder and put one cartridge back in.\n\nAccording to Hellmeier, Hendren first pointed the gun \"away\" and pulled the trigger, but the revolver did not fire. Alix then took the weapon, aimed it at Hendren and pulled the trigger, but still the gun did not fire.\n\nOn the third shot, Hendren pulled the trigger while pointing the gun at Alix, and the gun discharged, the statement reads. Alix died from a gunshot wound to the chest.\n\nKimberly Gardner, the circuit attorney for the city of St. Louis, wrote in a statement Friday that her office had filed charges against Hendren for involuntary manslaughter. The felony carries a sentence of three to 10 years in prison.\n\nAlix \"represented the police department in an honorable manner, and she had a very bright future,\" Gardner wrote. Alix was hired by the department in June 2016, according to St. Louis Today.\n\nAlix's mother, Aimee Chadwick, told KMOV that her daughter loved her job as a police officer.\n\n\"Katie was one of a kind,\" she said. \"There will never be another Katie.

The young man from the Bronx, who spent three years detained on Rikers Island without being tried or convicted, was accused of stealing a backpack.\n\nNearly two of Browder's three years in jail were spent in solitary confinement. He was released in 2013 after the charges were dropped. And in 2015, plagued by what he said was the mental anguish and trauma from his time in jail, he hanged himself in his mother's home.\n\n\"Kalief Browder's story helped inspire numerous reforms to the justice system to prevent this tragedy from ever happening again, including an end to punitive segregation for young people on Rikers Island,\" Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for the city law department told NPR in an emailed statement.\n\n\"We hope that this settlement and our continuing reforms help bring some measure of closure to the Browder family,\" he added.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, \"the civil rights and wrongful death action is before a judge in State Supreme Court in the Bronx.\"\n\nBrowder's family was satisfied with the settlement, Scott Rynecki, one of the family's attorneys, told NPR.\n\n\"The family is pleased that they can bring closure to this part of the matter but hopes that the national recognition that the case gave to the need of prison reform and dealing with younger individuals continues,\" Rynecki said.\n\nBrowder adamantly maintained his innocence throughout his incarceration, which he served because his family couldn't afford to pay his $3,000 bail. Over the years, he rejected numerous guilty plea deals that would have allowed him to escape what he said were savage conditions at the prison. He described instances of violent beatings and torment at the hands of other inmates and guards. He said he was starved and kept in filthy surroundings. And he spoke of intolerable mental anguish suffered at the hands of prosecutors who repeatedly delayed his trial in the Bronx's infamously overburdened court system.\n\nEven after being out in the free world for some time, cleared of any wrongdoing and suddenly thrust into the spotlight as a symbol of New York City's pernicious and crippled criminal justice system, Kalief Browder feared he'd been changed forever. That he had been damaged at the core of his innermost self after nearly three years of being caged, mostly in solitary confinement, as an adolescent on Rikers Island after he was arrested.\n\n\"People tell me because I have this case against the city I'm all right. But I'm not all right,\" Browder told The New Yorker in 2014.\n\nThe case against the young African-American man, who was jailed in 2010 at 16, was eventually dismissed without ever being tried. After 31 court appearances before eight different judges, the charges against Browder were dropped. His accuser had left the country and the prosecution could not move forward with the case. Meanwhile, Browder had gone from teenager to adult, missing his high school graduation and enduring a brutal existence within the prison's confines, at least half of which was spent alone in a 12- by 7-foot cell.\n\nWhen he spoke to the magazine he had filed a lawsuit against the city, the New York Police Department, the Bronx District Attorney and the Department of Corrections. Still, he worried that no amount of money would make him whole again.\n\n\"I'm messed up. I know that I might see some money from this case, but that's not going to help me mentally. I'm mentally scarred right now. That's how I feel. Because there are certain things that changed about me and they might not go back,\" Browder said.\n\nIn the end it proved too much. In 2015, he took his own life. He was 22.\n\nThe New Yorker story catapulted Browder to the fore of a national debate about the criminal justice system, especially as it applies to minors. Two months after the story ran, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio put an end to the city's use of solitary confinement for 16- to 17-year-olds.\n\nUpon learning of Browder's death, de Blasio said, \"Kalief's story helped inspire our efforts on Rikers Island, where we are working to ensure no New Yorkers spend years in jail waiting for their day in court.\"\n\nLater, when plans to permanently shutter the prison were set in motion, de Blasio pointed to Browder's suicide as a \"wake-up call\" to the city, adding that \"his death shook the whole city and opened everyone's eyes and made people think twice.\"\n\nThe city plans to permanently close Rikers Island and has proposed establishing smaller, neighborhood-based facilities.\n\nIn 2016, former President Barack Obama similarly noted Browder's experience when he enacted a ban on solitary confinement for juveniles detained in federal prisons.\n\nBrowder struggled to find his place outside of Rikers Island after he was released, \"Before I went to jail, I didn't know about a lot of stuff, and now that I'm aware, I'm paranoid,\" he told The New Yorker. It was a feeling he couldn't shake, even as he was championed as the catalyst for much-needed change.\n\n\"I feel like I was robbed of my happiness,\" he said."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/25/688499170/the-heartbeat-of-wounded-knee-aims-to-usher-in-a-new-narrative-for-native-americ", "text": "'The Heartbeat Of Wounded Knee' Aims To Usher In A New Narrative For Native Americans\n\nIn the 1970 work by Dee Brown, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, the author \u2014 a non-Indian with seemingly little connection to any current tribes \u2014 declared that \"the culture and civilization of the American Indian was destroyed\" during the late 1800s.\n\nNot so fast, says author David Treuer.\n\nTreuer calls his new book, The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present, a \"counternarrative\" to Brown's classic \u2014 which sold millions of copies with its story of U.S. government betrayal, forced relocation and massacres.\n\nTreuer recalls reading Brown's book while in college in the 1990s and being dismayed by the tales of Indian reservations as nothing more than worn places of hopelessness and squalor. A member of the Ojibwe Tribe from Minnesota with a Ph.D. in anthropology and several novels under his belt, Treuer tells of the tug of family and tribe and the lure of the north woods at his Leech Lake Reservation.\n\nAs Treuer shows, the Indians not only have maintained their culture and civilization through some dark years \u2014 but in some parts of the country, today, are thriving. The heartbeat is strong. He writes:\n\n\"I came to conceive of a book that would dismantle the tale of our demise by way of a new story. This book would focus on the untold story of the past 128 years, making visible the broader and deeper currents of Indian life that have too long been obscured.\"\n\nTreuer begins with a swift look at the beginnings of European contact, with its endless tales of kidnappings, rapes, broken treaties and armed attacks. But he shows that in each and every part of the country, Indians hung on.\n\nThis retelling is the weakest part of the book, although there are some nice historical tidbits: Gen. George Washington was called Hanodaganears \u2014 \"Devourer of Towns\" \u2014 by the Iroquois of upstate New York for his scorched-earth policy toward the British allies.\n\nThe author shines, instead, when he heads out on the road to meet with his relatives at Leech Lake or members of other tribes across the United States. There is a delightful collection of characters. Intrepid entrepreneurs, savvy lawyers and others who work for the best interests of their tribes.\n\nPeople like Sierra Frederickson in North Dakota, a writer and teacher at a community college, who uses social media to connect members of her tribe. Or Bobby Matthews of Leech Lake, who hunts, traps and harvests near the lake. Or Sean Sherman, a Sioux chef, who takes Treuer to an organic farm that grows \"historical indigenous varietals,\" everything from Cherokee beans to Oneida corn to Lakota squash, to sell at casinos and restaurants the tribe owns, as well as to private homes.\n\n\"The American Indian Dream is as much about looking back and bringing the culture along with it as it is about looking ahead,\" Treuer writes.\n\nTreuer is not afraid to take on some of the more high-profile Native Americans, including addressing corruption among the hierarchies of some tribes and the leadership of the American Indian Movement, a radical and sometimes violent group from the 1960s and 1970s. He says many Indians muttered under their breath that AIM really stood for \"Assholes in Moccasins.\" It was the \"destructive antics of its leadership, which hurt a great many people.\" But AIM also energized Indians to the \"radical notions\" that they don't have to accept their position of disenfranchisement.\n\nThat energy created homes for low-income urban Indians, on-site day care and health care, and Indian-centric cultural programming. Programs teaching vanishing languages are on the rise, he says. And more and more people are claiming Indianness than ever before.\n\nThe federal government that once lied, cheated and attacked the Indians finally in the late 1970s helped turn things around for the tribes, Treuer says. There was the Carter-era American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978, which allowed tribes to exercise religious traditions.\n\n\"The effect of the act was profound,\" Treuer writes. \"Younger and urban Indians had a chance to discover and participate in traditions that had been lost to them.\"\n\nThis was followed by something else also profound \u2014 and lucrative: the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan, which codified the process for tribes to administer gambling. Many Indians refer to \"BC\" \u2014 before casinos \u2014 he says. It has had as defining an effect on the social and economic lives of Indians, Treuer writes, as the mass migration of Indians to cities during the past 50 years.\n\nOf the more than 500 federally recognized Indian tribes in the U.S., fewer than half \u2014 238 \u2014 own and run gaming operations. Revenues grew from $100 million in 1988 to more than $26 billion in 2009. It works better for some tribes than others, Treuer says, noting that some tribes create museums, jobs programs, schools and cultural centers. Also, some tribes share the vast wealth among their members. But it has not helped all Indians. Unemployment is still high, especially in the northern Great Plains, with unemployment rates as high as 77 percent.\n\n\"The contrasts, while extreme, shouldn't be surprising. This is America, after all,\" he writes, with all but a shrug. \"Like all American avenues to wealth, casinos privilege the few and leave out the majority.\"\n\nTreuer said he wrote the book to show that Indians lived on after Wounded Knee \"as more than ghosts and more than the relics of a once happy people.\"\n\n\"I have tried to catch us not in the act of dying but, rather, in the radical act of living,\" he writes.\n\nHe succeeds in this fine and timely work. It will certainly help usher in a new narrative for Native Americans."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/01/25/688287824/steep-climb-in-benzodiazepine-prescribing-by-primary-care-doctors", "text": "Steep Climb In Benzodiazepine Prescribing By Primary Care Doctors\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Getty Images Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe percentage of outpatient medical visits that led to a benzodiazepine prescription doubled from 2003 to 2015, according to a study published Friday. And about half those prescriptions came from primary care physicians.\n\nThis class of drugs includes the commonly used medications Valium, Ativan and Xanax. While benzodiazepines are mostly prescribed for anxiety, insomnia and seizures, the study found that the biggest rise in prescriptions during this time period was for back pain and other types of chronic pain. The findings appear online in JAMA Network Open.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nAnd while benzodiazepines are best for short-term use, according to physicians, the new study found that long-term use of these drugs has also risen. From 2005 to 2015, continuing prescriptions increased by 50 percent.\n\nLong-term use of the drugs can cause physical dependence, addiction and death from overdose.\n\n\"I don't think people realize that benzodiazepines share many of the same characteristics of opioids,\" says Dr. Sumit Agarwal, an internist, primary care physician and researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and one of the authors of the new study.\n\n\"They are addictive,\" he says. \"They cause you to have slower breathing; they cause you to be altered in terms of mental status. And then, eventually, [they] can cause overdose and deaths.\"\n\nPrevious studies have shown a nearly eightfold rise in mortality rates from overdoses involving benzodiazepines \u2014 from 0.6 in 100,000 people in 1999 to 4.4 in 2016.\n\n\"That's somewhere around 10,000 to 12,000 deaths at the hands of benzodiazepines,\" says Agarwal. \"This rise is happening quietly, outside of the public eye.\"\n\nAnd according to a recent report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the overdose mortality rate involving benzodiazepines for women between the ages of 30 and 64 has increased by 830 percent between 1996 and 2017.\n\n\"Women are more likely to be prescribed these medications,\" Agarwal says. \"Women are more likely to come in to the clinic to be treated for anxiety and depression, and benzodiazepines tend to be one of the medications we reach to.\"\n\n\"The study highlights that we have a very serious problem with benzodiazepines,\" says Anna Lembke, an associate professor of psychiatry and medical director of addiction medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. She wasn't involved in the new study.\n\n\"I am concerned that our national focus on opioids has hidden the problem related to benzodiazepines \u2014 that's our next frontier,\" says Dr. Joanna Starrels, as associate professor at the department of medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She wasn't involved in the new study, but co-authored a 2016 study that found a rise in prescription rates and overdose deaths from this class of drugs between 1996 and 2013.\n\nLembke notes that the biggest rise in outpatient visits that led to benzodiazepine prescriptions were from primary care physicians and not psychiatrists.\n\n\"I think the big message here is that primary care doctors are really left with burden of dealing, not only with chronic pain and opioid prescription, but also benzodiazepine prescriptions,\" she says.\n\nThe trends, she adds, reflect \"the incredible burden of care on primary care physicians, who are given little time, or resources\" to handle a high volume of pain patients with complex conditions.\n\n\"That's partly what got us into the opioid epidemic in the first place,\" Lembke notes.\n\n\"Generally speaking, primary care physicians have not received the training that they need to prescribe medications that have such high risk for addiction or overdose,\" says Starrels.\n\n\"Primary care doctors,\" she says, \"are the frontline providers. \"And in many settings, particularly in rural areas, we may be the only providers. So we end up needing to treat conditions where specialists may be better trained \u2014 like chronic pain, addiction and anxiety.\"\n\nGiven the rise in benzodiazepine prescriptions for back pain and chronic pain, \"it may be that benzodiazepines are taking the place of opioids,\" says Lembke.\n\nHowever, Starrels cautions that the new study couldn't determine whether the patients who were treated for back or chronic pain were prescribed a benzodiazepine for their pain. It's also possible they were prescribed these medications for anxiety or insomnia in addition to being treated for pain.\n\nThe new study also found that the co-prescribing of benzodiazepines with opioids has risen during this time period. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, says Lembke.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\n\"What we don't want doctors to do is cut patients off of opioids,\" she says. \"That's neither humane nor medically the right path. Some of these co-prescribing may be because doctors are tapering patients off of opioids.\"\n\nBut co-prescribing these two kinds of medications can be dangerous. \"They both slow down the central nervous system in complementary ways [that] increase the risk of overdose deaths,\" says Starrels. \"It is dangerous \u2014 and generally advised not to prescribe together.\"\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned doctors about the dangers of prescribing opioids and anxiety medications together.\n\nAgarwal says that warning may have had a positive effect on prescription rates of these anxiety meds. \"Next couple of years of data will be very telling,\" he says.\n\nStarrels notes that benzodiazepines have not been shown to be effective for chronic pain. And there's more effective treatment for insomnia, she says.\n\nFor example, a form of talk therapy has been shown to be one of the most effective treatments for insomnia. And simply practicing better sleep hygiene can make a big difference, she says.\n\nPhysicians who want to move patients off their long-term use of benzodiazepines should do it slowly over time, Starrels cautions. \"It has to be slow and medically monitored over time,\" she says, because \"sudden withdrawal can be fatal.\"\n\nShe says primary care doctors should get better guidelines for prescribing these drugs, just as there are CDC guidelines for opioid prescription.\n\n\"People have started calling this 'our other prescription drug problem' \u2014 the first one being opioids, but this one's flying under the radar,\" Agarwal says. \"It would be great if we address it before it becomes an epidemic \u2014 if there isn't already one.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2018/12/09/643444815/all-the-criminal-charges-to-emerge-so-far-from-robert-muellers-investigation", "text": "All The Criminal Charges To Emerge So Far From Robert Mueller's Investigation\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nUpdated March 13, 2019 at 2:09 p.m. ET\n\nThe longer special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has gone on, the more President Trump has railed against it. Since the investigation began in May 2017, the president has taken to Twitter and dismissed it as a \"witch hunt\" more than 151 times.\n\nThat criticism aside, the special counsel investigation has resulted in criminal counts against more than 30 people and three Russian entities. And while the final outcome of the Mueller probe remains far from certain, it has already generated new insights into how Russia targeted the election, the presidential transition and Trump's business empire.\n\nHere's a closer look at where things stand:\n\nIndicted: Roger Stone\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nRoger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to President Trump and a self-proclaimed \"dirty trickster,\" was arrested by FBI agents at his home in Florida and charged with seven counts, including obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements in relation to Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe special counsel's indictment alleges that Stone was in regular contact with WikiLeaks (identified in the indictment as \"Organization 1\") and the Trump campaign at key moments as stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign were being released to the public ahead of Election Day in 2016. The timing of these communications, prosecutors allege, suggest officials in the Trump campaign knew ahead of time that WikiLeaks' had stolen the emails and was prepared to leak them.\n\nAccording to the indictment:\n\n\"After the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign.\"\n\nThe indictment says Stone \"thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases.\"\n\nAs NPR's Philip Ewing and Tamara Keith note, the indictment was the first to charge an American in relation to the theft and release of stolen Democratic Party emails. Moreover, \"it shows Mueller wants to try to prove that at least one person in the Trump campaign's orbit colluded with Russian's election interference.\"\n\nStone, who pleaded not guilty, has repeatedly denied that he played any role in helping the Russian attack on the 2016 election. In May, he told NPR that the special counsel was \"following a fake news narrative, which continues to repeat incorrectly that I had advance knowledge of the content source or exact timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures.\"\n\nConvicted: Paul Manafort\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Keith Lane/Getty Images Keith Lane/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump's former campaign chairman pleaded guilty in September 2018 to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice \u2014 charges that stemmed from a range of alleged crimes committed over more than a decade as a lobbyist, and later, a member of the Trump campaign.\n\nIn pleading guilty, Manafort agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation. Less than three months later, though, the special counsel's office told a federal judge in Washington, D.C. that he had \"breached the plea agreement.\"\n\nManafort's attorneys insist he gave the government useful information, but prosecutors said Manafort committed new crimes \"by lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel's Office on a variety of subject matters.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Manafort had intentionally lied to the special counsel's office which meant Mueller's team was no longer bound by the plea agreement.\n\nAt sentencing, Jackson ordered Manafort to 43 months in federal prison on top of the 47 months he was sentenced to serve in a separate case brought by the special counsel in Virginia. In all, he'll serve just under 7 1/2 years.\n\nIn the Virginia case \u2014 the first to reach trial for the Mueller investigation \u2014 prosecutors accused Manafort of failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars that he earned as a consultant for pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine and kept hidden from the IRS.\n\nThe jury found Manafort guilty on eight counts in the sprawling tax and bank fraud case, but deadlocked on 10 others, prompting U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III to declare a mistrial on those charges.\n\nManafort had been facing as much as 24 years in prison, but Judge Ellis told the court that such a penalty would have been \"excessive,\" adding that Manafort had lived \"an otherwise blameless life.\"\n\nIn her sentencing decision, Jackson broke from that assessment. \"It is hard to overstate the number of lies and the amount of fraud involved,\" she said of Manafort's case. \"A significant portion of his career has been spent gaming the system,\" she also said.\n\nPleaded guilty: Michael Cohen\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yana Paskova/Getty Images Yana Paskova/Getty Images\n\nAt one time, lawyer Michael Cohen said he would \"take a bullet\" for Donald Trump. But by pleading guilty in November 2018 to lying to Congress, Cohen raised new questions about Trump's business interests in Russia during a pivotal period of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nCohen admitted that he lied when he told Congress that discussions about a potential Trump Tower project in Moscow ended in January 2016. Actually, he said, they continued through June of that year.\n\nAccording to court documents, Cohen also initially said that his overtures to the Russian government went unrequited, but as talks progressed, he eventually heard back from a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin: Dmitry Peskov.\n\nCohen also pleaded guilty in August 2018 to five counts of tax evasion, one count of falsifying submissions to a bank and two campaign finance violations \u2014 a plea that directly implicated the president.\n\nThe campaign finance violations stem from two payments that Cohen helped arrange ahead of Election Day in 2016 to buy the silence of former Playboy model Karen McDougal and the adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels. The women say they had sexual relationships with Trump.\n\nTrump has acknowledged that he reimbursed Cohen for a $130,000 payment to Clifford \u2014 but denies the alleged relationships with both women.\n\nCohen told a federal judge that he made the payments \"in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,\" and that he did so \"for the principal purpose of influencing the election.\"\n\nOn Dec. 12, 2018, Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in prison. He had been facing as many as 63 months. Cohen was also ordered to pay nearly $2 million for his crimes.\n\nPleaded guilty: W. Samuel Patten\n\nW. Samuel Patten pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a foreign agent for lobbying work he performed for a political party in Ukraine called Opposition Bloc.\n\nProsecutors said Patten partnered with a Russian national to lobby on behalf of the pro-Russia party, providing political consulting to members, including an unnamed Ukrainian oligarch. They received more than $1 million for that work, which included setting up meetings with government officials and members of Congress, and drafting op-eds to appear on behalf of the oligarch inside U.S. news outlets.\n\nThough unnamed in court papers, the Russian national is believed to be Konstantin Kilimnik, who for years worked closely with Paul Manafort in Ukraine. Patten's case was brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia on a referral from the special counsel.\n\nPatten has not yet been sentenced.\n\nPleaded guilty: Rick Gates\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLike Manafort, Rick Gates was once a top aide to Trump, serving as his deputy campaign chairman during the 2016 presidential race, and later, as a senior aide on the presidential inaugural committee.\n\nBefore that, Gates spent years as Manafort's protege.\n\nGates agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation after pleading guilty in February 2018 to financial fraud and lying to federal investigators.\n\nHe was originally charged alongside Manafort with conspiracy to launder money, making false statements and other charges in connection to their work advising Russia-friendly politicians in Ukraine.\n\nAt Manafort's trial, Gates testified that he and his former partner used offshore bank accounts and wire transfers in order to hide money from the IRS. Gates faces as much as six years in prison. He has continued cooperating with the government as its investigations go forward and has not yet been sentenced.\n\nPleaded guilty: Alex van der Zwaan\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAlex van der Zwaan became the first person to be sentenced in the Mueller probe after he pleaded guilty to lying to investigators.\n\nThe son-in-law of a Russia-based billionaire, van der Zwaan acknowledged in federal court in February 2018 that he misled investigators about a conversation he had with Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign aide, in September 2016.\n\nThe conversation focused on a report that van der Zwaan's law firm prepared about the prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko, a political rival of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nHe was sentenced to 30 days in prison and a $20,000 fine.\n\nRead the statement of the offense\n\nPleaded guilty: Richard Pinedo\n\nRichardo Pinedo is a California man who in February 2018 pleaded guilty to identity fraud.\n\nPinedo admitted to making tens of thousands of dollars by creating hundreds of bank accounts, often using stolen identities. He then sold those accounts on the Web to unidentified foreign users.\n\nIt's unclear to what extent, if any, those users included suspects connected to the Russia investigation. But it's possible they were used as part of a scheme described by Mueller's office in which Russians intent on attacking the 2016 election moved money around the world to pay for virtual private networks, Web hosting services and other such cyber-tools.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Pinedo's attorney, Jeremy I. Lessem, said that if his client's actions did assist \"any individuals, including foreign nationals, with interfering in the American presidential election, it was done completely without his knowledge or understanding.\"\n\nPindedo was sentenced to six months in prison, six months of home confinement and 100 hours of community service.\n\nPleaded guilty: Michael Flynn\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Michael Flynn led chants of \"lock her up\" at the Republican National Convention, and after Trump's victory, was appointed to serve as his first national security adviser.\n\nBut he lasted less than a month on the job before resigning, and in December 2017, he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition.\n\nThe single count against Flynn related to discussions with ambassador Sergey Kislyak around two issues: Obama administration sanctions on Russia and a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements.\n\nAccording to court documents, Flynn denied to investigators that he asked Kislyak to either defeat or delay the U.N. vote on settlements, and that he also asked the Russians to refrain from retaliating against the sanctions. The government said Flynn was directed by \"a very senior member\" of the transition team.\n\nFlynn, a former Army general, would eventually admit to misleading the FBI about those conversations, and as part of his plea deal, agreed to cooperate with the special counsel's investigation. Ahead of his sentencing hearing, prosecutors said Flynn had provided \"substantial\" aid with \"several ongoing investigations,\" telling a court his assistance merited a judge's consideration.\n\nPleaded guilty: George Papadopoulos\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos was the first person charged in the Mueller investigation and pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI.\n\nPapadopoulos was a junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump 2016 campaign \u2014 one of a number brought on early amidst questions about who would advise Trump about foreign affairs. Trump once praised him as an \"excellent guy.\"\n\nIn January 2017, the FBI questioned Papadopoulos about his interactions with a professor based in London with links to the Russian government. The official told Papadopoulos that the Russians had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails,\" according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors say Papadopoulos went on to use the professor's connections in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n\nIn his interview with the FBI, Papadopoulos originally described the professor as \"a nothing,\" but investigators said that \"In truth ... Papadopoulos understood that the professor had substantial connections to Russian government officials.\"\n\nPapadopoulos' attorney said when he was sentenced that he didn't recall whether he'd communicated the information about the dirt on Clinton to his superiors on the Trump campaign.\n\nHe was sentenced to 14 days in prison. In a statement provided to NPR after his release in December 2018, his lawyer emphasized there was no evidence that he colluded with Russia and that he has never been accused of doing so or of being involved in any plot to undermine the presidential election.\n\nIndicted: Russian Intelligence\n\nIn July 2018, the Justice Department brought charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers on a litany of alleged crimes related to Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Clinton presidential campaign.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who announced the charges, said the defendants worked for the Russian government's Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff \u2014 known by its Russian initials as the GRU.\n\nIn a 29-page indictment, the Justice Department outlined how the attackers were able to access and steal sensitive Democratic Party emails and information, and then carefully timed their release for maximum political impact through fictitious online personas that included \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\"\n\nThe Russians also targeted state election systems, and stole information related to approximately 500,000 voters. However, because Russia is unlikely to extradite the accused suspects, the case is unlikely to go to trial.\n\nIndicted: Konstantin Kilimnik\n\nKonstantin Kilimnik worked alongside Paul Manafort in Ukraine for more than a decade. He started as a translator, and later helped run his lobbying operations in Kiev, according to Politico.\n\nIn June 2018, the special counsel's office charged Kilimnik with obstruction of justice for allegedly trying to persuade witnesses to lie to the jury in the government's then-pending case against Manafort. Ultimately, Manafort pleaded guilty and the matter did not go to trial.\n\nKilimnik is believed to be living in Russia, meaning it's unlikely he'll be extradited to the U.S. for trial.\n\nIndicted: Russian Internet trolls\n\nA federal grand jury indicted 13 Russians and three Russian entities in February 2018 for what Rosenstein described to reporters as \"information warfare\" with \"the stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.\"\n\nAt the center of the indictment was the work the Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm based in St. Petersburg. It was there, Rosenstein said, that the suspects \"took extraordinary steps to make it appear that they were ordinary American political activists.\"\n\nThey created \"hundreds of social media accounts\" to divide Americans around polarizing issues, and according to the indictment, \"engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton ... and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe indictment doesn't assess whether the disinformation scheme succeeded in swaying votes, and the U.S. intelligence community also says it hasn't assessed what kind of effect the scheme had on the outcome of the 2016 White House race. Barring Russia's cooperation in extraditing the accused disinformation specialists, they are unlikely to face trial."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/24/688147596/democrats-to-offer-deal-on-border-to-end-shutdown", "text": "Trump: Short-Term Deal To End Shutdown OK If It Has 'Prorated Down Payment' On Wall\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nUpdated at 9 p.m. ET\n\nAfter an at-times heated debate, the Senate on Thursday, as expected, failed to approve either of the competing measures that would have ended the standoff over border wall funding.\n\nIf nothing else, the votes seemed to spur a flurry of efforts to find a way to end the standoff. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced on the Senate floor after the measures failed that he spoke with President Trump about a three-week stopgap bill to reopen the government.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y., met to discuss the proposal. But later Thursday evening, a spokesman for Schumer said, \"Sen. Schumer and Senate Democrats have made clear to Leader McConnell and Republicans that they will not support funding for the wall, prorated or otherwise.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement saying that the White House had already made it clear to Graham that a three-week bill \"would only work if there is a large down payment on the wall.\"\n\n\"It depends\"\n\nSpeaking to journalists Thursday evening from the White House during an event about trade, Trump said he was open to a compromise with Democrats that reopens the government if it includes a \"prorated down payment\" on the border wall that has been the sticking point in the ongoing funding impasse. But no breakthrough appeared to be imminent, based on the president's comments.\n\nThe president said he is open to whatever results from the discussions between McConnell and Schumer, but Trump would not commit beyond a broad statement to assess what the Senate leaders announce.\n\n\"It depends on what the agreement is,\" the president said. \"If they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support it.\"\n\nTrump also restated how important he thought a permanent barrier on the Mexico border is to prevent what he called the smuggling of drugs and humans through \"wide open spaces\" where no such barrier stands now. He acknowledged that much of the contraband smuggled into the United States arrives at major ports of entry, but he said, \"The big stuff comes through the areas where you have nobody watching.\"\n\nDueling proposals fail\n\nDespite Trump's apparent willingness to entertain a short-term deal that would reopen the government, Democrats in Congress have been resistant to supporting any funding that would go toward construction of a wall or other barrier on the border with Mexico.\n\nThe Senate votes followed by a renewed effort to find a deal came on Day 34 of the partial government shutdown, which has left some 800,000 federal employees without their second straight paycheck \u2014 which many would have received Friday.\n\nThe first vote, on a proposal by Trump to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall as well as changes in immigration law, received 50 votes in favor, with 47 senators voting against it. Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas voted against the GOP measure while Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted in favor.\n\nThe second proposal, sponsored by Senate Democrats, would have provided for two weeks of operating money for the government but included no funds for a wall while discussions on border security continued. It received 52 votes in its favor, and 44 senators opposed it. Six GOP senators supported the Democratic bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Cory Gardner of Colorado.\n\nBoth measures needed 60 votes to advance.\n\nAs a group of freshman House Democrats visiting the Senate chamber looked on earlier Thursday, tempers rose during the Senate debate. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., lashed out at Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who instigated a previous shutdown over funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, during the Obama administration.\n\nWith his arms crossed, Bennet accused Cruz of \"crying crocodile tears\" over the current lack of funding for first responders, including the Coast Guard. \"When the senator from Texas shut this government down in 2013, my state was flooded,\" Bennet said.\n\n\"It was underwater!\" Bennet continued. \"People were killed! People's houses were destroyed! Their small businesses were ruined forever! And because of the senator from Texas, this government was shut down for politics.\"\n\nC-SPAN via YouTube\n\nThe negotiations\n\nEarlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., threw cold water on reports that Democrats were working on a deal to fund border security but not a wall. At a Thursday morning news conference, she said Democrats were not engaging in behind-the-scenes planning of an offer.\n\nShe said Democrats are working on the regular appropriations bill for the next fiscal year, which could contain additional money for border security.\n\nTop Democrats and their aides had told reporters about a proposal that would outline the mutual border security priorities for Trump and members of Congress but would include no new funding for any wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., declined to offer specifics about what is being worked out by Pelosi and the House Homeland Security Committee, but he said Democrats are prepared to make an offer that includes significant new spending on border measures.\n\n\"We are prepared to spend a very substantial sum of money because we share the view that the border needs to be secure,\" Hoyer said. \"The letter is going to articulate what we believe is an effective investment to accomplish border security.\"\n\nTrump wants $5.7 billion for the wall, and the Democrats' proposal could exceed that amount.\n\nAppearing on NPR's Morning Edition, White House Director of Strategic Communications Mercedes Schlapp did not immediately rule the idea out. \"Why don't we have the Democrats come over and propose that over to the president?\" she said. \"What we need is a conversation.\"\n\nBut it's not clear whether Trump would sign off on the offer.\n\nSeveral conservative leaders who met with Trump on Wednesday to discuss immigration policy and strategy told NPR that the president had resolve and believed the ball was in Pelosi's court.\n\n\"You don't negotiate against yourself, and that was a clear message,\" said Ken Cuccinelli of the Senate Conservatives Fund.\n\nAs for a strategy following the failed Senate votes, these conservatives said the White House was looking to peel off or win the support of moderate Democratic House freshmen who were elected last November in traditionally Republican districts. But that has been a White House strategy for more than a week, with few signs of defections.\n\nThere was no sense coming out of Wednesday's White House meeting that the partial shutdown would end anytime soon. \"We're out of the mentality that this is a sprint,\" said Cuccinelli.\n\nFood pantries\n\nRoughly 800,000 federal employees are affected by the shutdown. Many will miss their second paycheck this week. Food pantries have been set up in several cities for the workers.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC on Thursday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, \"I don't quite understand why\" federal workers are going to food banks, suggesting they apply for loans to make ends meet until they receive back pay. \"There is really not a good excuse\" for why the affected workers face what Ross termed \"a liquidity crisis.\"\n\nIn his remarks from the White House on Thursday, the president defended Ross though he said he hadn't heard Ross' actual remarks. \"But I do understand perhaps he should have said it differently,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president continued: \"Local people know who they are, where they go for groceries and everything else, and I think what Wilbur was probably trying to say is they will work along. I know banks are working along, if you have mortgages, the mortgagees, the folks collecting the interest and all of those things, they work along. And that's what happens in time like this. They know the people, they've been dealing with them for years, and they work along \u2014 the grocery store \u2014 and I think that's probably what Wilbur Ross meant.\"\n\n\"He's done a great job, I'll tell you that,\" the president also said about his commerce secretary.\n\nPressure to resolve the shutdown also came from an unexpected source: former White House chief of staff and former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. He and four other former DHS secretaries wrote a letter to Congress and the president urging them to end the shutdown.\n\n\"DHS employees who protect the traveling public, investigate and counter terrorism, and protect critical infrastructure should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills while they steadfastly focus on the mission at hand,\" the former secretaries wrote. \"This is unconscionable.\"\n\nNPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith and congressional reporter Kelsey Snell contributed to this report."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2019/01/24/688131461/hear-weezers-surprise-new-covers-album", "text": "Hear Weezer's Surprise New Covers Album\n\nWeezer surprised its fans this morning after dropping a collection of cover songs overnight.

Mic Network, which operates a news publication aimed at millennials, laid off its entire editorial staff late last year, shortly before selling the remains of the company to the Bustle Digital Group. Just weeks earlier, Vice Media announced a hiring freeze reportedly aimed at cutting its staff by up to 15 percent.\n\nAnd on the same day that BuzzFeed announced its layoffs, The Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon's media group \u2014 which includes AOL, Yahoo and HuffPost \u2014 will be laying off 7 percent of its staff.\n\nHuffPost deputy opinion editor Chloe Angyal says her entire section is being eliminated as part of the layoffs. \"Like so many talented and lovely journalists,\" she tweeted, \"I was laid off today.\"\n\nThe layoff announcements have not been confined to the digital landscape.\n\nGannett, the publishing company behind USA Today and a host of prominent local newspapers, such as The Indianapolis Star and The Arizona Republic, began a round of layoffs Wednesday that claimed the jobs of a number of longtime journalists \u2014 such as political columnist Tim Swarens from the Star.\n\n\"I'm in shock,\" he said Wednesday. \"Not how I wanted 35 year journalism career to end.\"\n\nAs for BuzzFeed, the layoffs come at a time already filled with tumult.\n\nThe digital news and entertainment site founded in 2006 and best known for viral content that reaches millions of readers worldwide has made a series of huge splashes with its news division in recent years \u2014 from publishing the infamous \"Steele dossier\" on President Trump to its reporting on a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow.\n\nMost recently, BuzzFeed News has found itself embroiled in controversy over a report that Trump instructed Michael Cohen, his former personal attorney, to lie to Congress about the tower negotiations. Not long after the report's publication, special counsel Robert Mueller's office issued an exceedingly rare \u2014 and carefully worded \u2014 rebuke of how BuzzFeed characterized the documents and testimony obtained by his office.\n\nIn the firestorm that followed, the company has stood by its story.\n\n\"It's a long line of reporting by these reporters on this specific story that we feel very good about, very confident about,\" BuzzFeed News Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith told NPR last Friday.\n\nPeretti, the company's CEO, sought to express the same support for BuzzFeed employees Wednesday, even as he discussed the upcoming layoffs.\n\n\"This will be a tough week for all of us and I realize it will be much worse for the people losing their jobs.

One boy, wearing a red Make America Great Again hat, stands just inches away from the man's drum, staring at him with a wide smile.\n\nNathan Phillips, an Omaha elder participating in the Indigenous Peoples March, keeps drumming and singing.\n\nThe jeers of the students \u2013 and Phillips' stoic response \u2013 were captured in a video that has sparked widespread criticism and drawn an apology from a Kentucky prep school and diocese.\n\nYouTube\n\nThe students and Phillips had both converged in Washington, D.C., last Friday. The students, a group of boys from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky, were there to attend the March for Life. Phillips had come for the first-ever Indigenous Peoples March, on the same day.\n\nVideos show a number of young men and women, predominantly white, jumping, cheering and chanting, in a dense circle around Phillips. Many are wearing Trump paraphernalia, and some are wearing clothing associated with the Covington high school.\n\n\"I heard them saying, 'Build that wall, build that wall,' \" Phillips says in another video posted to social media, wiping away tears. \"This is indigenous lands. You know we're not supposed to have walls here. We never did, for millenniums, before anyone else came here. We never had walls.\"\n\nCovington Catholic High School, a private, all-male school located in Park Hills, Ky., issued a joint statement with the Diocese of Covington on Saturday, condemning the incident and saying it would investigate and \"take appropriate action, up to and including expulsion.\"\n\n\"We extend our deepest apologies to Mr. Phillips,\" the school wrote. \"This behavior is opposed to the Church's teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person.\"\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, a student identifying himself as Covington junior Nick Sandmann, released a statement to CNN in which he said he was the teen at the center of the video and that Phillips \"approached me, coming within inches of my face.\"\n\n\"I never interacted with this protestor. I did not speak to him. I did not make any hand gestures or other aggressive moves,\" the statement read. \"To be honest, I was startled and confused as to why he had approached me. We had already been yelled at by another group of protestors, and when the second group approached I was worried that a situation was getting out of control where adults were attempting to provoke teenagers.\n\n\"I believed that by remaining motionless and calm, I was helping to diffuse the situation.\"\n\nPhillips is a well-known Native American activist who reportedly also is a former director of the Native Youth Alliance. He served in the Marine Corps Reserve during the Vietnam era, according to Pentagon records.\n\nHe was singing the American Indian Movement anthem in front of the Lincoln Memorial, at the close of the march, The Washington Post reports. He says March for Life rally participants had taunted the indigenous crowd.\n\nHe told the Post he felt threatened and that the boys swarmed around him.\n\nAnother video appears to show Phillips approaching the large group of students. Phillips told MSNBC there was a small group of Black Hebrew Israelites in the area, exchanging escalating racial taunts with the students, and that he walked in-between the two groups because he feared for the safety of the Black Hebrew Israelites.\n\nThe incident drew condemnation from Native Americans and lawmakers. Darren Thompson, an organizer for the Indigenous Peoples Movement, which coordinated the march, said in a statement that the incident was \"emblematic of the state of our discourse in Trump's America,\" echoing sentiments on social media and among organizers that the current administration's rhetoric has emboldened acts of harassment and racism.\n\n\"It clearly demonstrates the validity of our concerns about the marginalization and disrespect of indigenous peoples,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nAnother spokesperson for the march, Chase Iron Eyes, also placed the blame on President Trump.\n\n\"Conservative people are fearful now,\" he said, referencing the recent elections of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress, Deb Haaland and Sharice Davids. \"Trump has riled up a reactionary voting block that reminds us that we are a nation founded on patriarchy, genocide and racism.\"\n\nHaaland, who was elected to the House of Representatives last fall, also condemned the incident.\n\n\"This Veteran put his life on the line for our country,\" the Democrat from New Mexico wrote on Twitter. \"The students' display of blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance is a signal of how common decency has decayed under this administration. Heartbreaking.\"\n\nCovington Mayor Joe Meyer, a Democrat, said footage was not representative of the core values of his town. \"Videos of the confrontation are disturbing, discouraging, and \u2014 frankly \u2014 appalling,\" he wrote in a statement. \"And they are rightfully inspiring a tidal wave of condemnation.\"\n\nOrganizers added that the march encompassed more than just that viral moment.\n\n\"The good news is, that connection to the sacred may have resonated with some of the Catholic youths,\" said Nathalie Farfan, another organizer, in a statement. \"What is not being shown on the video is that the same youth and a few others became emotional because of the power, resilience and love we inherently carry in our DNA. Our day on those steps ended with a round dance, while we chanted, 'We are still here.' \"\n\nThe march stemmed from the 2016-17 protest at Standing Rock over plans for an oil pipeline to cross Sioux Lands in North Dakota. Phillips was also a leader in that movement."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/12/662925592/deaf-and-unemployed-1-000-applications-but-still-no-full-time-job", "text": "Deaf And Unemployed: 1,000+ Applications But Still No Full-Time Job\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Madeleine Cook/NPR Madeleine Cook/NPR\n\nAmanda Koller is getting her second master's degree. She has applied for more than 1,100 jobs in the past year. She hasn't gotten any full-time, permanent job offers.\n\nShe is also profoundly deaf.\n\nThe unemployment rate among the deaf is staggering. Fewer than 40 percent of those with a hearing disability work full time, according to the Yang-Tan Institute at Cornell University's analysis of 2016 American Community Survey data. Despite improvements in technology and accommodations that are making it easier for deaf people to work and communicate, deaf job hunters say employers still don't believe they can do the work.\n\n\"I apply to grocery stores and I can't even get a job there,\" said Koller, who lives outside Washington, D.C. \"If you can't hear or speak right, you're not going to get a job. I don't think it matters what the company is, or what your background and work experience is.\"\n\nIf you can't hear or speak right, you're not going to get a job.\n\nOn paper, Koller's background is impressive. She has a master's degree in public administration from Western Michigan University and a bachelor's in health sciences from Temple University. She's currently working toward a second master's in health care quality management from George Washington University.\n\nMany companies have been interested in interviewing Koller for entry-level positions, she said. That's where the trouble always started.\n\nWhen Koller told hiring managers she was deaf and preferred to interview in person so that she could lip-read, she says she was often ghosted or told that a phone screening was mandatory.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Madeleine Cook/NPR Madeleine Cook/NPR\n\nKoller has tried to do interviews over a special phone that allows her to speak for herself and read a transcript of what the other person is saying, but the text often lags and the process is time-consuming.\n\n\"People get so angry and say, 'I don't have time for this,' and they hang up on me,\" Koller said.\n\nKoller thinks she's hitting a wall because of her disability, but she has no way to prove it. Employers often said they went with a candidate who was a \"better fit,\" without mentioning her deafness.\n\nEach rejection made Koller more determined to get a job. She woke up most days at 5 a.m. to look for jobs and obsessively submitted applications until 9 p.m. She kept an Excel sheet of every job she applied to. She did some consulting work to pay the bills. It wasn't enough.\n\nHer bank account was negative, her credit cards were overdrawn, her student loans were unpaid. She cried every day and even contemplated suicide.\n\n\"I couldn't see a tomorrow; I couldn't see a future,\" she said. \"I was angry about having a hearing loss.\"\n\nIn October 2017, her significant other coaxed her to go to counseling. That cost more money. Now, the size of Koller's debt is over $200,000.\n\nHigher education isn't a guarantee\n\nThe same month she started counseling, Koller discovered she was not alone. She was added to a Deaf/HH Job Seeker Network Facebook group, which has 4,700 members. Group members and other deaf individuals NPR spoke with have struggles that echoed Koller's \u2014 they have good educations and many qualifications, yet couldn't get entry-level jobs.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Madeleine Cook/NPR Madeleine Cook/NPR\n\nThe co-founder of the Facebook group, Ernest Willman, saw this trend firsthand after he graduated in 2016 from Gallaudet University, a historically deaf college in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"My class mostly went to go to get master's,\" he said. \"Sometimes because we can't get jobs, we have to get higher education to prove that we can do the job.\"\n\nWillman says deaf people still face the stigma that they are stupid or incapable \u2014 often referred to as \"deaf and dumb.\"\n\nMaryam Hussein, also a member of the group, graduated in 2016 from historically deaf college RIT/NTID \u2014 Rochester Institute of Technology's National Technical Institute for the Deaf \u2014 after double majoring in graphic design and visual media. In the two years since, she says she has applied to more than 3,000 jobs.\n\nNow living in Chicago, her dream is to work in a gallery. But these days, she says any job would be good.\n\nShe thinks she hasn't been hired because she has two disabilities.\n\n\"Hiring managers were shocked to realize that I was deaf and in a wheelchair. I could see on their faces that they wouldn't want to hire me,\" she said.\n\nEvery day she and her deaf friends ask each other, \"Have you found a job yet?\" Mostly, the answer is no.\n\nSo Hussein returned to school. She is working toward her master's degree in mental health counseling with art therapy at Prescott College. It was a financial risk that involved taking out over $15,000 in loans. She's waiting to see if the gamble pays off.\n\nRIT/NTID's career center director, John Macko, said students need to advocate for themselves in every step of the job application.\n\nFinding the right interpreter is a crucial first step for many that Macko said can make a big difference. When a deaf person makes a call on video phone, a sign language interpreter is free \u2014 and randomly assigned.\n\nThat means the interpreter might not understand the field a student is interviewing in.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Madeleine Cook/NPR Madeleine Cook/NPR\n\nOne biology student hung up on nine different interpreters before finding one who knew enough about biology to interpret for her, Macko said. That student received a job offer.\n\n\"I'm convinced that if she didn't hang up the first time, she wouldn't have gotten the job,\" he said.\n\nThe challenge of proving discrimination\n\nProving discrimination as a deaf person can be extremely difficult, according to Howard Rosenblum, CEO of the National Association of the Deaf. Companies might interview a deaf candidate and provide interview accommodations, but won't actually consider hiring the deaf candidate, he said.\n\nRosenblum has been a disability discrimination lawyer for more than 26 years. He says he rarely decided to take employment discrimination cases because, he says, instead of admitting discrimination, companies will make up other reasons to explain their hiring decisions.\n\n\"They'll look like they're following the law,\" Rosenblum said. \"The law right now is not very effective. The law says you can't discriminate and must provide reasonable accommodation, but how do you prove discrimination?\"\n\nThe current law that is supposed to prevent discrimination is the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which went into effect in 1992.\n\nIn the 26 years since, Rosenblum said it's unclear whether the ADA has had a significant impact on deaf employment rates.\n\nTechnology improvements have made it easier for deaf people to bring attention to their employment struggles and file discrimination lawsuits, though litigating such cases can take years.\n\nMaria Morocco, a supervisory trial attorney at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, says that increasingly available accommodations give companies fewer excuses not to hire someone because of a disability.\n\nCurrently, the EEOC is working on a nationwide case against FedEx on behalf of roughly 300 deaf workers who charge that they were not provided reasonable accommodations to perform well at their jobs.\n\nA FedEx spokesperson wrote in an email to NPR that the claims are \"misleading and not founded in law.\"\n\nIn 2015, the EEOC filed about 20 lawsuits on behalf of deaf plaintiffs. The total number of discrimination cases the EEOC received that year relating to hearing impairments was 827.\n\nIncentivizing employers\n\nIn order for anti-discrimination laws such as the ADA to be effective, Rosenblum proposes two additional measures.\n\nThe first is a quota for private employers, similar to the ones that currently exist for the federal government and federal contract employees.\n\nPrivate companies with federal contracts must hire people with disabilities for 7 percent of their workforce.\n\nFederal agencies have a higher quota of 12 percent, 2 percent of which must have a targeted disability such as deafness, blindness or significant mobility impairments.\n\nRosenblum would also like to see businesses set up a centralized reasonable accommodation fund (CRAF) to help pay for any accommodations a new employee might need.\n\n\"It removes the economic disincentive for hiring workers with disabilities,\" he explained. \"Different departments may not have the budget for disability accommodations or may try to hire the cheapest people.\"\n\nA cause for hope\n\nMore than 40 different private companies and government agency employers set up booths and chatted with prospective applicants at Careers & the Disabled magazine's career expo last November.\n\nAt one table, Ryan Walters, a representative from the professional services company Deloitte, sat in his wheelchair and asked an attendee, \"Are you familiar with Deloitte?\"\n\nWalters has a cochlear implant. So did the attendee.\n\nThough Walters used spoken word, the attendee did not. Luckily, there was an interpreter, provided by Careers & the Disabled magazine.\n\nIn every area of the expo, attendees signed to interpreters at various booths, conducting small interviews and introductions.\n\nFor Shakeitha Stone, one of dozens of deaf attendees, it was a chance to interview with ease. She cracked a few jokes while discussing a job with the Environmental Protection Agency. Then she stepped away from the EPA booth with a smile.\n\n\"I just had my first interview in four years,\" she said. \"I'm praying, hoping I get a job.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/altlatino/2019/01/23/687685048/peque-o-poesias-y-m-s-this-week-in-latin-music", "text": "'Peque\u00f1as Poes\u00edas' Y M\u00e1s: This Week In Latin Music\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist\n\nThis week's Alt.Latino playlist is packed with percussive tracks, including rustic takes on reggaeton, classical flute juxtaposed with trap beats and romantic jingles livened with spoken word.\n\nAt the bottom of this page is the playlist, as part of a series of NPR Music's favorite Latin songs, updated weekly on Spotify.

Attorney General\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nIt's early days still, but the Democratic field of 2020 presidential candidates is growing. The latest to throw in her hat - California Senator Kamala Harris. Harris has branded herself a progressive, but she also carries political baggage that opponents may use to question her progressive credentials - controversial decisions she made as a prosecutor and attorney general of California.\n\nChris Cadelago is a reporter for Politico. He's been following Harris' career for years. Welcome to the program.\n\nCHRIS CADELAGO: Thank you so much.\n\nCORNISH: So you were based in Sacramento during the years when she was a prosecutor, right? Based on what you saw at the time, how was her tenure characterized?\n\nCADELAGO: As an attorney general, people often criticized Kamala Harris for being overly cautious, basically for siding with law enforcement too often. And I think some of those cases where that came up where some statewide ballot initiatives where she did not take a position on one in particular that would have reduced some felonies to misdemeanors.\n\nCORNISH: Now, when you look at a potential candidate - I'll say like a Joe Biden - people are already talking about his role in the mid-'90s in terms of the crime bill - right? - and its connection to mass incarceration. Is there anything like that for Kamala Harris that could kind of come back as a criticism?\n\nCADELAGO: So even though Kamala Harris has long been personally opposed to the death penalty, she made a vow when she ran statewide in California that she would uphold the law of the land. And there was a sort of famous case in Orange County where the issue of the death penalty came before her office, and her office actually took the side of the state and argued that the death penalty should stand. And her critics now point to that and say, you know, that was an opportunity for her to really take a stand and say, you know, this should not be the law of the land in California. And that's not something that she did.\n\nCORNISH: We saw just as recently as the last presidential election issues of criminal justice coming to the forefront in the Democratic primary. Can you talk about how different the politics are now for this next crop of candidates and including Kamala Harris?\n\nCADELAGO: Sure, yeah. We were just starting to hear a lot of the sort of voices creeping up within the Democratic Party at the time in 2016. Now I think people have really come to digest the new environment that we're in with really the Black Lives Matter movement really taking hold across the country. And I think you've seen prosecutors across the country come out and really take much stronger - what some folks would call activist positions. Folks in Kamala Harris' camp who have come up a couple - maybe a generation or two before them really were a lot more in line with this sort of standard law-and-order prosecutor that sort of defended the law of the land even though she did take some other approaches in her career.\n\nCORNISH: So what does that mean looking forward to 2020? How do you think she tries to reframe this resume?\n\nCADELAGO: She's really going to position herself as a progressive prosecutor and a public interest attorney, as she calls it, someone who worked on behalf of the people. She had clients, so to speak, who were sexually assaulted young women and girls, and she was in the courtroom trying to seek justice for them. That is something that she's going to point out - and I think a lot of environmental laws related to California where she was taking on the big polluters. So I think she has to really own this profile as a prosecutor and talk about the ways in which she did things differently.\n\nCORNISH: What are you going to be looking for in the coming weeks?\n\nCADELAGO: I think the question - she has a speech in Oakland on Sunday, which is supposed to really mark the start of her campaign. And I think that speech is going to take place only a few blocks from where she worked for years at the Alameda County Courthouse, and so it - there's a lot of symbolic value to the location. And I think this part of her record is something she's going to have to explain to people, and she's going to lead with this idea that she was not only a prosecutor but a progressive prosecutor.\n\nCORNISH: Chris Cadelago is a reporter for Politico. Thank you for speaking with us.\n\nCADELAGO: Thank you so much.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In an earlier version of this story, we incorrectly reported that Sen.

And if nothing changes come Friday, hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck.\n\nAmong those federal workers, FBI agents. The FBI Agents Association says without funding, that important counterterrorism, drug and child abuse investigations are stalled.\n\nThomas O'Connor is president of the association, which advocates for more than 14,000 former and active FBI special agents. And he joins me now. Mr. O'Connor, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.\n\nTHOMAS O'CONNOR: Thank you for having me.\n\nKELLY: So point me towards an example. When you say that investigations, operations that should be unfolding, aren't, give me one example.\n\nO'CONNOR: Well, we reached out to our field agents and asked them to give us examples. And I'll read you just one of the many. It's, quote, \"not being able to pay confidential human sources risks losing them and the information they provide forever. It is not a switch that we can turn on and off,\" end quote.\n\nKELLY: What kind of operation would that person be involved with?\n\nO'CONNOR: Well, the person is talking about counterintelligence and counterterrorism. But, you know, confidential informants are a tool which is used by the FBI in all of our investigations. And when you don't have the money to pay those people, that information source can dry up. People will do it for a period of time. But they also have bills to pay also, right?\n\nKELLY: Yeah. Well, this is an important point to just stay on for a minute because I think a lot of us understand FBI agents are considered essential workers. So I know that they're not being paid, but they're on the job. The point you're making is the people they need to get their job done, if they're not getting paid, informants aren't going to show up and cooperate. Translators who you need to get your work done, they're not going to show up necessarily.\n\nO'CONNOR: Well, there are people that are furloughed in not only the FBI, but the U.S. Attorney's Office, which is part of the Department of Justice that assists the attorneys that we work with on a daily basis processing subpoenas, search warrants, this type of stuff. And those people aren't there to do their job.\n\nSo when agents go to the U.S. Attorney's Office to try and move their case forward, the U.S. Attorney's Office is not able to assist the way they would if the government was funded and they were fully staffed.\n\nIt is not just our agents. It is the people that we work with that are affected by this shutdown, and it slows down the investigations across the board.\n\nKELLY: There are also practical issues that I hadn't thought about. If an FBI agent misses a credit card payment or a mortgage payment, they have to worry about all the things that any other federal worker would, in terms of maybe messing up their credit rating or losing their home. They also have to worry about messing up their security clearance.\n\nO'CONNOR: Right. So FBI agents go through a thorough background investigation when they're hired and on a regular basis throughout their career. As part of that, we have to do what's called a financial disclosure on an annual basis. We have to disclose every dime that comes into our family. And anytime there is some type of a failure to pay or if your credit rating gets hit because you weren't able to make a payment, this can potentially be damaging to a person's clearances, top secret and above.\n\nKELLY: It sounds like when you put out this call to agents in the field - tell me your stories, tell me what's going on - you heard back from a lot of people. And you heard back loud and clear.\n\nO'CONNOR: We heard back from hundreds of members. I mean, there are heartbreaking stories when it comes to the personal side of things. And there are disturbing stories when it comes to the operational side of things. FBI agents are doing their job today just like they did it before the shutdown. And we will continue to do our jobs once the shutdown ends.\n\nKELLY: As we have reported on the shutdown and we've checked in with other government agencies, some of them have described stopgap ways they're finding of keeping things running, you know, pulling from a different pot of money that was set aside for something else. Understanding that that's not an ideal solution or a long-term solution, is some of that not possible within the bureau?\n\nO'CONNOR: Oh, it is possible. And FBI headquarters has done Herculean work in trying to find funding veins for us to use. But as we continue to go forward and no new moneys come into the FBI, it doesn't take a rocket scientist or an accountant to tell you that operations and personnel are going to suffer.\n\nKELLY: Thomas O'Connor He's president of the FBI Agents Association. Thanks very much for taking the time.\n\nO'CONNOR: Thank you very much for having us. And I hope that next time we speak, that this is all done\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Questions about how each acted in the episode have led to online condemnations, apologies and then recriminations against the press. Joining us to sort it all out is NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Hey there, David.\n\nDAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, Audie.\n\nCORNISH: So we have multiple videos out now online of the same scene, but it began with one, and it showed a Native American man and a white high school student inches apart with this crowd of other students chanting and jumping and smiling around him. Do we have a clearer picture now of what led to that point?\n\nFOLKENFLIK: I think we do. I want to be careful about that, but I think we do. I mean, initially, this was a Rashomon moment meeting a Rorschach test, right? And what I think we now find is that these students were part of, in some ways, a three-party encounter. You had - a bunch of largely white, largely male students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky outside Cincinnati were at the - in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial for the March on Life event Friday. You had a fringe hate group called Black Hebrew Israelites, African-Americans, heaping invective upon whites they saw - just incredibly ugly rhetoric. And into this wanders a couple of Native American activists, including Nathan Phillip, who plays a drum and sings a song that he later says - tells NPR and others that he hoped in some ways would bring peace and de-escalate.\n\nSome of the things the kids did were, you know, derogatory, derisive, denigrating. You saw some tomahawk chops from some students. You saw some chanting and mockery in some ways satirizing the Native American song. And so there was some ugliness as well as some other stuff there - perhaps not as bad as was initially alleged and charged.\n\nCORNISH: Now, how does the media fall into all of this?\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Well, I think you saw some great lurching. You saw it on social media and particularly on online and cable, say, as Friday gave way to Saturday, Sunday - some real invective against the students. And there was condemnation by journalists and pundits, particularly online but also on cable. And then you saw, you know, calls for the students to be doxed - that is, their identities exposed, their homes, claims that they should be punished by their schools. You saw apologies by officials from the archdiocese locally there. And then the media went the other direction as more information came to light as it was clear that they were being subject to some abusive things from the Black Hebrew Israelites. And some questions - they didn't themselves surround the Native American protesters. It turns out that Philip (ph) and the small group of others approached them.\n\nCORNISH: President Trump says the students of Covington Catholic High School have become symbols of fake news. What is the media's role in this becoming politicized?\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Well, I think the fact - the combination of social media and a somewhat polarized media and a quick-twitch media just desperate to get it out in some ways amplified some of the flaws in the reporting and, you know, overlooked some of the nuances and some of - a little bit of the texture in this - that is, there was ugliness there, but it wasn't as clean as presented. And I think that the president, of course, uses this regardless.\n\nBut I also think that it's important to note, you know, the students were there. They were wearing, you know, Make America Great Again caps. They seemed derisive. And, you know, the student at the center of it, Nick Sandman, he's hired in response to this criticism a PR firm based in Louisville with close ties the national Republican Party. He is set to show up tomorrow on the \"Today\" show on NBC to make his case. So, you know, he's willing to utilize the media as well.\n\nCORNISH: What should people take from this?\n\nFOLKENFLIK: I think you take from this some of these verities. You know, a buddy of mine texted me over the weekend. He said I think media people were expressing the need to learn lessons they should have learned in journalism school. I think all journalists have - and in fact, all citizens, all of us, have to constantly relearn lessons we should know. Take your time. Take a breath, maybe not the sharpest judgment. Maybe don't draw the deepest conclusion. There should be the accretion of information, not this sort of pendular lurching from side to side.\n\nCORNISH: That's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. David, thank you.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: You bet.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we incorrectly refer to the March for Life as the March on Life and we incorrectly refer to Nathan Phillips as Nathan Phillip.]\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF J DILLA'S \"JAY DEE 49\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

If it continues, 800,000 federal workers will miss a second paycheck.\n\nCongress, though, has returned to Washington after the long weekend. And lawmakers will be voting on President Trump's new proposal to end the stalemate and get federal employees back to work.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nThat's right. Here's what he's offering. He is offering to extend temporary protections to roughly 700,000 DACA recipients - those are the immigrants who were brought to the country as children - also to another 300,000 immigrants who fled countries destabilized by war or catastrophe.\n\nNow, in exchange, Trump wants 5.7 billion for a border wall and also wants changes to rules for asylum seekers. That is a proposal that most Democrats reject.\n\nNPR's congressional reporter Kelsey Snell joins me now in the studio. Hey, Kelsey.\n\nKELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi there.\n\nKELLY: All right. So help me understand the role that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is playing 'cause he holds some cards here. And he had said he wasn't going to allow votes on any bills until Democrats and the president were onboard. So what's his strategy now?\n\nSNELL: Yeah, all of that changed over the weekend when - I understand McConnell approached the president about a week ago and told him that the dynamic needed to change. And the president now made the announcement of his plan over the weekend. And since then, McConnell has agreed to vote on not just the president's plan, but a second thing proposed by Democrats, which is a short-term spending bill to keep the government open - or reopen the government until February 8. And it would provide disaster aid.\n\nNow...\n\nKELLY: So these are two separate proposals...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSNELL: Two separate proposals that would kind of have a dueling vote on Thursday. And part of the idea here is they need to prove what is possible. McConnell had said that he wasn't interested in doing show votes. And really that could end up being what this is.\n\nBut some of this is about politics, right? So 2020, that - while that may seem far away to some people, it's not that far away in the politics of Washington. And he's - what has happened here is McConnell's trying to force Democrats to vote against opening the government in the president's bill. He kind of wants to shift the pressure. And by adding disaster aid and an expansion - an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, he kind of gets that leverage.\n\nAnd, you know, it's one of these things where he thinks it'll be harder for Democrats to reject the president's proposal when they're seeing all of this pressure to get those 800,000 workers back to work.\n\nKELLY: And what is the Democratic strategy to counter Senator McConnell's pressure? Because up to now, we've seen Senator Pelosi and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, they've kind of kept Democrats in - in line and united. Is that - are we seeing signs of cracks there?\n\nSNELL: It's hard to say if the cracks are really expanding. There are some moderates who are pressuring Democrats to get to a vote. But, you know, it's really been one of those situations where Democrats are united against the asylum portion of this bill.\n\nThey're calling it - they're calling it a poison pill. And they are seeing this as kind of, you know, Trump is pushing for a temporary fix to DACA and to TPS, these - these protections for immigrants. But he's offering that as a solution in exchange for everything that he wanted, and it's easier for Democrats to keep their own party together on that message of pushing back on the president on that.\n\nKELLY: And polls showing, for now, Democrats still - that they're still kind of prevailing in terms of public opinion?\n\nSNELL: So far, and as long as that holds, it makes it easier for Democrats to stay together and keep the pressure on the president.\n\nKELLY: NPR's Kelsey Snell, thank you.\n\nSNELL: Thank you.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we incorrectly refer to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Sen.

This means that if Trump gets his $5.7 billion border wall, it would cut right through the tribe's land.\n\n\"It would be as if I walked into your home and felt like your home was not safe, but I want to build a wall right smack in the middle of your home and let me divide your family,\" Verlon Jose, vice chairman of the Tohono O'odham Nation, tells NPR's David Greene. \"It is putting a blockage into our way of life, into things that we've been doing for hundreds and hundreds of years. And when you interrupt those things, bad things happen.\"\n\nJose also notes that his nation has been in existence long before the Gadsden Purchase, which drew the border between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nPlans for the exact wall route have not been released, but because its nation spans both countries, the tribe is concerned; Jose has been lobbying congressional lawmakers.\n\nNotes This map reflects the Tohono O'odham Nation land in the United States, home to about 32,000 tribal citizens, according to Verlon Jose, the tribe's vice chairman. There is no similar delineation of the tribe\u2019s land in Mexico; according to Jose, about 2,000 tribal citizens live there.\n\nJose says the Tohono O'odham land in the U.S. totals 2.8 million acres, home to around 32,000 tribal citizens. About 2,000 tribal citizens live in Mexico, he says, though it's unclear the exact boundaries of that land.\n\nFor a long time, there was just a four-strand barbed wire fence marking this stretch of the border. But after the U.S. government struck a deal with the Tohono O'odham in 2006, Jose says vehicle barriers made of heavy steel were installed across most of the 62-mile divide. Now the Tohono O'odham only have three specific points where they can cross, he says.\n\nA more permanent barrier, however, would affect the tribe and could \"totally\" stop the Tohono O'odham from being able to move in either direction, Jose says. Currently, citizens go back and forth across the border for domestic, religious and cultural purposes \u2014 after Border Patrol agents check their IDs and backgrounds, he says.\n\nSupporters of a wall see that section of the border as vulnerable: a rural and desolate place where any number of people can slip into the U.S. without proper documentation. They point to the thousands of migrants picked up each year while trying to cross into the U.S. illegally through the Tohono O'odham nation, as well as the area's drug smuggling problem.\n\n\"We share that concern, but a wall is not the answer to stop the drugs or dangerous people from coming to America,\" he says.\n\nIt is not entirely clear whether President Trump has the authority to just take land from the Tohono O'odham tribe to build a wall. Monte Mills, co-director of the Margery Hunter Brown Indian Law Clinic at the University of Montana, says that would most likely take an act of Congress.\n\n\"The law basically requires that there be some clear statement \u2014 usually by Congress \u2014 if tribes are going to be deprived of certain rights,\" he tells NPR.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nHow building a border wall would affect the Tohono O'odham nation\n\nIt was affect it greatly \u2014 more so because we don't know what that actually means. Are you building a 30-foot concrete wall? A 30-foot steel wall? How are the people going to be able to cross? How are the animals going to be able to cross? It is within our responsibility that we also have to be in consider the wildlife and we cannot interrupt migratory flows of the wildlife. So, yes, it will have a major impact on us. It does so now even with the vehicle barriers. There are traditional routes that we use for our sacred ceremonies and that people have used for many, many years. When we negotiated our compromise with the vehicle barrier, we're still able to somewhat go in those areas. But a wall? Would totally stop us from going in either direction. That would certainly interrupt the traditional practices of our people.\n\nReligion Texas Chapel In Path Of Trump's Proposed Border Wall Texas Chapel In Path Of Trump's Proposed Border Wall Listen \u00b7 5:40 5:40\n\nOn his experiences dealing with migrants trying to cross through the Tohono O'odham nation illegally\n\nWe have a ranch a few miles just north of the international border, and they come by the ranch way too often. There'd been a decrease over the years, but they still come by and if we're not there ... they'll break in and help themselves to food and water.\n\nThe Tohono O'odham have always been hospitable people \u2014 even with [the] first European contact. So that's just our thing. Nowadays it's gotten where a lot of drugs are being involved. They seem to just want to go in and destroy your homes, and that's what we feel that we're being disrespected and that we're being violated by these migrant crossers. But at the same time there are two probably different groups of people that come through the border. You got the migrants that are coming looking for the American dream and then you got those who are hauling drugs.\n\nOn the relationship between tribal police and Border Patrol agents\n\nWe have hundreds of Border Patrol on patrol on our nation. I'd like to say that we have an OK relationship. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. I can't say it's a great relationship, but we work together [to stop illegal border crossing]. Our local law enforcement works with the Border Patrol on securing the border. Our local law enforcement spent about 60 to 70 percent of their time on border issues, and about $3 million annually on border issues. So we work hand-in-hand with them.\n\nOn the argument that a border wall would address concerns of illegal immigration and national security\n\nI believe that working together we can do more.\n\nTechnology is a key. Right now they're proposing the integrated fixed tower \u2013 that's a virtual wall that's going to be out there that's going to be the eyes out there. ... So that's why we believe that a wall would not work. Yes, one terrorist could come through there, but look at how many terrorists that we already have in America. When you look at when you look at all the tragedies that happen in America, and I have not done any research on this myself, but if you look at how [much] devastation America has faced, how much is caused by people coming across the border?

Harris Wofford, a lifelong civil rights advocate and backer of progressive causes, died Monday at a Washington hospital at age 92.\n\nWofford died after suffering a fall, his son told The Washington Post.\n\nHis death on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s holiday was, perhaps, appropriate. He marched alongside King in Selma and played a key, behind-the-scenes role in the 1960 presidential campaign by encouraging Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy to reach out to Coretta Scott King, after her husband was imprisoned for a minor traffic violation in Georgia.\n\nAnd when he arrived in the Senate, Wofford worked with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., to make King's birthday a national holiday and day of service.\n\nLate in his life, Wofford, whose wife, Clare, died in 1996, married Matthew Charlton, a man 50 years younger whom he had met some years earlier on a beach in Florida.\n\nIn an essay in the New York Times, Wofford wrote:\n\n\"At age 90, I am lucky to be in an era where the Supreme Court has strengthened what President Obama calls 'the dignity of marriage' by recognizing that matrimony is not based on anyone's sexual nature, choices or dreams. It is based on love.\"\n\nWofford was born in New York City in 1926 and grew up in suburban Scarsdale. When he was 11, he accompanied his grandmother on a six-month world tour. He said he saw Mussolini denounce the League of Nations, visited Shanghai after it was captured by the Japanese Imperial Army and, in India, became \"fascinated\" by Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nHe volunteered for the Army Air Corps in World War II and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1948. He later attended Howard University Law School, becoming one of its first white graduates. He also received a law degree from Yale.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Byron Rollins/AP Byron Rollins/AP\n\nHe served on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and became a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. After Kennedy's election, he became a special assistant to the president for civil rights, and he helped found the Peace Corps, becoming its special representative to Africa and later an associate director.\n\nAfter leaving the government, Wofford went into academia, becoming president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury, and then just the second male president of Bryn Mawr.\n\nHe also found time to get himself arrested during protests at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago.\n\nIn the spring of 1991, after spending time as a private practice lawyer and as Pennsylvania's secretary of labor and industry, Wofford was appointed to fill the vacant Senate seat left after Republican Sen. John Heinz III was killed in a plane crash.\n\nHe won the special election that November over Republican Richard Thornburgh, in part by making health care his primary issue. In an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, Wofford was asked by host Bob Edwards why it had taken so long for health care to become a major political issue:\n\n\"How long, oh, Lord, how long? ...There's a tide in the affairs of men with issues and \u2014 and the tide is \u2014 is coming in on this issue now. The ... world has turned upside down in \u2014 in the last 12 years \u2014 12 months, but 12 years, too. The great enemy of four decades is gone \u2014 the Soviet Union. The hundreds of billions \u2014 trillions \u2014 we've spent in military spending overseas is not going to be necessary anymore. We ... have a chance to turn our priorities right side up, and at the top of our list of priorities should be a national health insurance plan.\"\n\nBut Wofford's tenure in the Senate was short-lived.

In 1995, during a national debate over affirmative action, Wofford wrote:\n\n\"Race is the oldest, most dangerous wedge in American politics, a time-tested way to split the nation apart. Once it led to civil war. For years afterwards, especially in the South, it was the way for demagogues to win elections.\"\n\nJohn Gomperts, his legislative director in the Senate and chief of staff at the Corporation for National and Community Service, said Wofford's life \"was one giant adventure.\"\n\nAsked what Wofford's legacy would be, Gomperts said it was \"the buoyant and endless pursuit of a better nation, a better world.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/21/687255698/delta-air-lines-pays-to-keep-martin-luther-king-jr-national-park-open-for-holida", "text": "Delta Air Lines Pays To Keep Martin Luther King Jr. National Park Open For Holiday\n\nThe Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park had been shuttered because of the partial government shutdown.

Even if nobody else comes to replace him, we always can come back to Dr. King.\n\nHURT: While King died in 1968, there's no need to read his biography at this service. Everyone in the room already knows it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I feel the spirit of the Lord in this room. Lift your hands all in the sanctuary if you love him today.\n\nHURT: The service instead focuses on the values King upheld, like unity, and applying them to the present day.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNICE KING: We can try to build a wall to physically separate ourselves from others, but walls do not negate our interconnectedness.\n\nHURT: That's King's daughter, Bernice, the CEO of the King Center in Atlanta. She hit on another news headline, too.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKING: And when a government shutdown persists to the point that it affects the livelihood of individuals and those in dire need of critical social services, this is a humanitarian crisis, and we are all in a state of emergency.\n\nHURT: Other speakers included different faith leaders, Georgia Congresswoman Lucy McBath, Emma Gonzalez, the activist from Parkland, Fla., and Senator David Perdue. Perdue is known for his close association with the president, but his remarks about King steered clear of politics.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDAVID PERDUE: Though we may talk differently, look different and have different political views, he would remind us we are at first and last one nation under God.\n\nHURT: It was the same point that Bernice King emphasized.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKING: It's time to stop merely praising King with platitudes and pleasantries.

Bennie Thompson Reacts To Trump's Border Wall Proposal\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nA non-starter, more hostage-taking - that's how Democrats are describing President Trump's offer over the weekend. The president said he would extend temporary protection to recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he wants for his border wall. Democrats want the government reopened before any negotiations on border security issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Republicans are trying to put some muscle behind the White House pitch. They plan to add in billions for disaster aid and extend the Violence Against Women Act. And they could try to put it to a vote as soon as this week. Congressman Bennie Thompson is a Democrat from Mississippi. He's also chair of the House Homeland Security Committee. He joins us on the line from outside Jackson. Welcome to the program.\n\nBENNIE THOMPSON: Thank you for having me.\n\nCORNISH: So what would your response be to DACA recipients who heard this offer and might have had some hope?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, I think at best that temporary proposal is just that. It gives no pathway to citizenship. And, again, it's just a crumb that the president is dangling in front of the public with no permanence to it. So I would say to the DACA people, don't be fooled. The president is just doing this in his pursuit of trying to get the money for the wall. It should not be a carrot in the process. The first thing we have to do is get our federal employees back to work.\n\nCORNISH: Let me jump in here because Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted Sunday that President Trump has, quote, \"put forward a serious and reasonable offer.\" Now, if Democrats say the president's proposal is a non-starter, as you're saying, is it fair for Republicans to say that you're not willing to negotiate?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, you know, at this point, it's people tweeting back and forth. We're not sitting down like adults negotiating. We get to a solution when we meet face-to-face. Every time we've tried to meet with this administration, the president throws a temper tantrum and basically walks out the room. That's not how you get a deal done. So Democrats are absolutely prepared to work with the president to make sure that we get government back open. And by all means, we are for border security. We've always been for border security. But the wall is a non-starter.\n\nCORNISH: Does that mean that there's no wiggle room?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, let me tell you. For two years, he talked about Mexico going to pay for it. Now he wants the taxpayers of America to pay for it. This is not a political stunt that Democrats will fall for. We are willing to look at technology. We'll look at bringing more men and women to the border from a security standpoint. But under no circumstances are we going to do a wall.\n\nCORNISH: If Democrats are able, say, to make a deal, do you want to fund the government for the rest of the year or are you looking for a short-term extension, something that would reopen the government and allow these negotiations to continue?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, we've tried short-term just to get people to work. We have 800,000 employees out here who are absolutely on the brink of bankruptcy in some instances. Our employees are not rich people. They go to work, but we should pay them. And now we put them in an untenable position where they're having to stand in line for food.\n\nCORNISH: So you're not seeing a short-term solution, a short-term extension.\n\nTHOMPSON: A short-term extension - we've offered it. Leader McConnell wouldn't even bring it up on the Senate side. We will do that if that brings people back to work. But we have to get out of this Trump shutdown.\n\nCORNISH: That's Congressman Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi.

Find more at NPR.org/Anthem.\n\nDisney's Frozen remains one of the greatest box-office successes in history. But in terms of impact and influence, it is perhaps most loved and best remembered for one of its breakout songs.\n\nNo matter which version you know best \u2014 the Oscar-winning film version sung by Idina Menzel, the pop version by Demi Lovato or the one currently performed on Broadway by Caissie Levy, star of Frozen's stage adaptation \u2014 \"Let It Go\" announces itself as an anthem right away.\n\nSince its arrival in 2013, many groups have found significance in the song on a personal level. Stories abound of gay, lesbian and transgender people, people in prison, people with eating disorders and chemical addictions and plenty of others on the margins, all identifying with the tale of a queen in hiding, who learns to shed her shame and accepts the things that make her different.\n\nYouTube\n\nBut there is one group for whom \"Let It Go\" has proven particularly resonant: People with disabilities. To understand why, it helps to remember some specifics of the story.\n\nIn Frozen, Queen Elsa sings \"Let It Go\" just moments after her dark secret has been discovered, forcing her into isolation. For years, she's tried to hide that she possesses the magic ability to create snow and ice, which flies out from her fingertips. She even cuts herself off from her little sister, Princess Anna, whom she loves. Elsa can't control her power, and on the day of her coronation, by accident, she turns her entire kingdom to ice.\n\n\"She's this little girl \u2014 nobody has ever been born like her,\" Kristen Anderson-Lopez says. She and husband Robert Lopez are the writing team behind Frozen's original songs. Anderson-Lopez says when they began writing \"Let It Go,\" she knew they were dealing with a character who was feeling ashamed and afraid.\n\n\"I pitched the idea of 'let it go,' as the hook, being about letting go of her past, letting go of the expectations, and how it could be about letting her power go,\" she says. \"And then Bobby started playing this vamp that was full of all that fear and shame and secret isolated pain.\"\n\nThe songwriters say they weren't trying to write a disability anthem (though Anderson-Lopez has a brother who is on the autism spectrum), but rather one about the pressure to be perfect. Anderson-Lopez thought about the societal pressure on women to be perfect; for Lopez, it was memories of being a student and needing to get the best grades. For Elsa, \"Let It Go\" is the moment she begins to stop holding herself to someone else's idea of perfect.\n\ntoggle caption Adrian Sanchez-Gonzalez/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"For this to be a good musical,\" Lopez says, \"that's one of the best parts \u2014 when a character transforms.\" As it turned out, many of those watching and listening found a lot to relate to in that moment of transformation.\n\nOne of them was Michelle Black. \"She used words like, 'a kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen,' and that was exactly what I was going through,\" Black says. \"She gave me words to describe this bipolar that I had that nobody had given me before.\"\n\nA choreographer and mother of three young children, Black says her diagnosis of bipolar II disorder was still pretty new \u2014 and confusing to her and her family \u2014 when the film came out. She says she'd sometimes get bursts of energy and creativity, which she liked \u2014 but when the depression came, she'd spend hours in her room and could be mean to people. The day she watched Frozen in a theater in Utah, she was sitting next to her 7-year-old son.\n\n\"And I started bawling watching this, especially this song, because someone finally understood me,\" she says. \" 'The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside' \u2014 that's exactly what it felt like to me, this swirling storm of emotions and thoughts and feelings going on inside of me that no one else understood. But Elsa seemed to get it.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just people with mental health conditions who felt seen by \"Let It Go\": Autistics and people with physical disabilities also identified with the feeling of being misunderstood, isolated or excluded, and wanting to reject the stigma.\n\n\"You tell someone you have a disability, they go, 'Oh, I'm so sorry.' No, there's nothing to be sorry about. This is who I am,\" says Cara Liebowitz, development director for the National Council on Independent Living, a disability policy group.\n\nLiebowitz is 26, born two years after the Americans with Disabilities Act banning discrimination against the disabled became law. She has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. But she also has hidden disabilities \u2014 obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety disorder. So Elsa, the queen whose hidden condition is dramatically revealed, feels like an ally.\n\n\"Elsa says, 'I don't care what they're going to say,' and I love that line,\" Liebowitz says. \"For once she's confident in herself, and she's not letting other people's opinions drag her down.\"\n\nThe Census Bureau estimates that about one in four Americans has a disability. On college campuses, the number of students seeking mental health services keeps going up: According to a research survey by the American College Health Association, the number of students who say they've ever been diagnosed with depression has grown since 2000 from one in 10 to about one in four today.\n\nThis is Elsa's generation \u2014 one that's quicker to recognize and accept having a disability. \"She's actively using her ice powers and they're part of who she is,\" Liebowitz says. \"Just like disability is part of who we are.\"\n\nFor 16-year-old Jagger Lavely, Frozen has been more than a passion: It has given him new ways to communicate. Jagger is austistic, and speaks in short, sometimes one-word sentences. But he loves the movie, has memorized \"Let It Go\" and can repeat the lyrics line by line.\n\nWhen he was 13, Jagger said he wanted to perform in his middle school's talent show. He dressed up in the costume of one of his favorite Frozen characters, Olaf the snowman. But, on stage, he stumbled over the words of \"Let It Go.\" It was a terrifying moment for his mother, Stacey Levine-Lavely, who was in the audience. She says she'd seen the frequent stares her son got in public, and had avoided movie theaters and similar spaces for years, in part, because of it. \"My chest tightened,\" she recalls, as she worried that the other kids would boo Jagger or mock him for forgetting the words.\n\nInstead, they started singing \"Let It Go\" along with him. \"It was one of those moments where he finally fit in,\" Levine-Lavely says. The video of that performance went viral \u2014 and Levine-Lavely, as a result, started a foundation to promote acceptance of people with autism.\n\nYouTube\n\nIn November, mother and son drove from their home in Massachusetts to New York to see the Broadway version of Frozen. It was part of a series of \"autism-friendly\" plays and musicals facilitated by the arts nonprofit TDF (formerly the Theatre Development Fund), which buys out theaters for shows where audience members like Jagger are free to sing along. Afterwards, outside the St. James Theatre, Jagger gave the show his review: \"Awesome.\"\n\nHis mother was more emotional. She says \"Let It Go\" speaks to her, too, as the parent of a child with autism \u2014 especially the lyrics about being \"the good girl you always have to be,\" which reminds her of the expectation to conceal her worries from others.\n\n\"I'd always been the good girl. I'd always been the girl everyone thought was so happy. My life seemed so charmed,\" she says. When she became the parent of a disabled child, people didn't understand her new reality or why she led a more isolated life. \"This song allowed me to kind of thumb my nose at that, because here he is. And he's made a difference in so many people's lives.\"\n\nAnd that's the power of \"Let It Go\": It's an anthem for people taking pride in who they are, the way they are. Kristen Anderson-Lopez says she still hears from people who identify with the song's message.\n\n\"I think anyone who's carrying a secret shame,\" she says, \"that gets so heavy that they really can't carry it anymore, is identifying with this idea of just shedding that and starting anew. Letting it out, letting it all explode and trying to find your way forward.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/21/686529163/the-rams-and-the-patriots-will-face-off-for-super-bowl-liii", "text": "The Rams And The Patriots Will Face Off For Super Bowl LIII\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David J. Phillip/AP David J. Phillip/AP\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots will face off in this year's Super Bowl after winning the NFC and AFC conference championships, respectively, on Sunday.\n\nThe Rams, who overcame a 13-point deficit to beat the Saints, last played in the Super Bowl in 2002 \u2014 against none other than the Patriots. The St. Louis Rams won the NFL title two years before that.\n\nThe Patriots defeated the Chiefs to return to the Super Bowl for a third consecutive year.\n\nLos Angeles Rams beat New Orleans Saints\n\nTwo field goals, a crucial interception and a widely contested pass interference call from officials, helped the Rams oust the Saints.\n\nWhat the team lacked offensively, Greg Zuerlein made up for with timely kicking. In the final 15 seconds of regulation, the placekicker booted a tying 48-yard kick, sending the game into overtime. In the extra period, Zuerlein nailed a 57-yard field goal to seal a 26-23 victory.\n\nOn the first drive of overtime, the Saints lost possession after safety John Johnson III picked off Drew Brees' lofty pass meant for wide receiver Michael Thomas.\n\n\"It's unbelievable, man. I can't put it into words,\" Rams quarterback Jared Goff told The Associated Press. \"The defense played the way they did to force it to overtime. The defense gets a pick and Greg makes a 57-yarder to win it. That was good from about 70. Unbelievable.\"\n\nOne call cast a long shadow over the game. Referees failed to call what both Saints supporters and sports analysts overwhelmingly perceived as a pass interference penalty against the Rams. With the score at 20-20 in the fourth quarter, Drew Brees' pass to Tommylee Lewis fell to the ground after he was hit by Rams defensive back Nickell Robey-Coleman.\n\n\"I don't know if there was ever [a] more obvious pass interference,\" New Orleans coach Sean Payton told reporters after the game.\n\nAfter the game the NFL confirmed in a call to Payton that referees made the wrong call, according to USA Today.\n\nAs the AP reports, \"It was the first home playoff loss for the Saints with Brees and coach Sean Payton, who had been 6-0 in those games since their pairing began in 2006.\"\n\nThe Rams will now play against the Patriots for the NFL title.\n\nNew England Patriots beat Kansas City Chiefs\n\nIn another playoff game settled in overtime, the Patriots held off the Chiefs to grab a spot in the Super Bowl for the third straight season.\n\nAfter New England dominated the first half in a frigid Kansas City, the Chiefs took the lead thanks to Damien Williams' third touchdown run of the game, forcing a frantic fourth quarter.\n\nWith 39 seconds left, running back Rex Burkhead was able to lift the Patriots ahead 31-28 \u2014 the fourth lead change of the fourth quarter.\n\nDown to 8 seconds, Harrison Butker wrestled back the points for the Chiefs with a 39-yard field goal, taking the rally into overtime at 31-31.\n\nThe Patriots then won the coin toss to start overtime. It was the final boost New England needed for a shot at the NFL title. Quarterback Tom Brady kicked off a game-winning drive as Rex Burkhead took the ball for a touchdown, sealing a 37-31 victory over the Chiefs.\n\n\"Overtime, on the road against a great team,\" Brady told the AP. \"They had no quit. Neither did we. We played our best football at the end. I don't know, man, I'm tired. That was a hell of a game.\"\n\nThe Big Game\n\nThe Rams and the Patriots will contend for the title of Super Bowl LIII champs at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Sunday, Feb. 3, airing on CBS.\n\nGladys Knight is scheduled to sing the national anthem.

Kamala Harris Announces 2020 Presidential Candidacy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Morigi/AP Paul Morigi/AP\n\nUpdated at 9:10 a.m. ET\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris is running for president in 2020. The first-term Democratic senator made the announcement on ABC's Good Morning America Monday morning.\n\n\"I love my country, and this is a moment in time that I feel a sense of responsibility to fight for the best of who we are,\" Harris said.\n\nThe 54-year-old Harris has been seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party even before she won a Senate seat in 2016. She received national attention as San Francisco district attorney before being elected California attorney general in 2010.\n\nHer campaign is highlighting that career, citing her experience on issues like sexual assault, housing and college affordability. Some of her proposals include middle-class tax cuts, rent relief, immigration and criminal justice overhauls, and Medicare for all.\n\nHarris's background in law enforcement could be a challenge in a Democratic primary, and she was asked on ABC about comments criticizing opposition to law enforcement on the left. \"I think it is a false choice to suggest that communities do not want law enforcement,\" Harris said. \"Most communities do. They don't want excessive force. They don't want racial profiling, but then nobody should.\"\n\nHarris is biracial \u2014 her parents were immigrants from Jamaica and India \u2014 making her only the second black woman and first South Asian-American person ever to serve in the Senate. One of just three black current senators, Harris plans to embrace that background in what is likely to be a large and diverse Democratic primary field.\n\nAnnouncing her run on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Harris' campaign says that is intended to highlight \"a reminder of the aspirational fight for progress that marked Harris' upbringing and that guides her today.\" She has modeled her campaign logo on graphics used by the late Rep. Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president.\n\nHarris spoke of her parents' involvement in the civil rights movement on Monday. \"That's the language that I grew up hearing, and it was about a belief that we are a country that was founded on noble ideals. And we are the best of who we are when we fight to achieve those ideals,\" Harris said.\n\nAfter arriving in the Senate in 2017, Harris quickly leveraged her seat on two high-profile Senate committees to become a national figure. Tapping into her prosecutorial background, Harris grilled Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in nationally televised intelligence committee hearings in 2017, then did the same last fall when the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nA recent NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist Poll found that a majority of Americans \u2014 54 percent \u2014 have not yet formed an opinion of Harris. But those who have a positive opinion of the California Democrat outnumbered those with a negative opinion by more than 3 to 1.\n\nHarris's announcement comes about a week after New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand kicked off her own presidential campaign, and three weeks after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren became the first high-profile Democrat to launch a 2020 White House run. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro formally declared a presidential run last week, as well, and several other Democrats have announced or indicated they will run, too.\n\nUnlike Warren, Gillibrand or Castro, Harris is not initially forming a presidential exploratory committee but instead immediately launching a full-scale presidential campaign.\n\nHarris has done little to hide her presidential ambitions. She traveled extensively for candidates during the 2018 midterm elections and made a stop in Iowa, which holds its caucuses before any other state holds primary contests. In the weeks leading up to her announcement, Harris made multiple high-profile media appearances promoting a recently released memoir.\n\n\"There's an incredible amount of change that has happened in a relatively short period of time, and it has understandably had a lot of people feeling displaced, wondering and asking a question about where do they fit in, their relevance, are they obsolete,\" said Harris in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition earlier this month. \"And [Trump] read it accurately. And then he took it to the lowest common denominator. [He said] it is us versus them instead of what real leadership would be about \u2014 which is to read it and say, 'Hey everybody, We're all in this together.' \"\n\nHarris will hold her first campaign rally next weekend in Oakland, Calif. \u2014 the city where she was born and held her first job as a prosecutor. Despite that connection, Harris will actually headquarter her campaign in Baltimore, a location that will allow her staff to be better positioned to travel to early-primary states as well as work in a news cycle driven by the Eastern time zone. (The campaign will maintain a second office in Oakland, as well.)"}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/20/686854202/family-of-american-jailed-in-syria-goes-public-in-an-appeal-to-trump", "text": "Family Of American Jailed In Syria Goes Public In An Appeal To Trump\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Maryam Kamalmaz Courtesy of Maryam Kamalmaz\n\nThe family of an American citizen believed to have been jailed in Syria two years ago is making his story public for the first time, spurred by President Trump's announcement last month that he will withdraw U.S. troops from the country.\n\nMajd Kamalmaz, a 61-year-old psychotherapist from Arlington, Va., arrived in Damascus on Feb. 15, 2017. He traveled to the Syrian capital for a condolence visit following the death of his father-in-law and to check on elderly relatives, according to his family. They say he was arrested at a checkpoint a day after he arrived.\n\n\"He felt safe going in. He's an American citizen. He has nothing to do with politics. Why in the world would anyone try to harm him?\" asked his daughter, Maryam Kamalmaz, from her home in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nFamily members say they have been working closely with the State Department for two years to locate Kamalmaz and secure his release.\n\nIn an email to NPR, a State Department spokesperson confirmed the U.S. government \"is in regular contact with the family\" but gave no further details \"due to privacy considerations.\"\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Maryam Kamalmaz\n\nThe Czech ambassador in Damascus, Eva Filipi, confirmed that Kamalmaz was held in a Damascus prison soon after his arrest in 2017, according to the family. Filipi has represented U.S. interests in Syria since the U.S. withdrew its ambassador after the outbreak of the civil war.\n\nFilipi named the particular jail where Kamalmaz was being held in Damascus and pledged to work for a speedy release, said Maryam Kamalmaz. But then, the trail went cold. \"We did not hear from her again,\" she said.\n\nThe family believes Kamalmaz is still alive and decided to make his case public now, she said, to make an appeal to President Trump as U.S. involvement in Syria winds down.\n\n\"I feel that President Trump has put a lot more effort than any other president in releasing detained citizens abroad,\" said Maryam Kamalmaz. \"Hopefully, he can bring our father home safely.\"\n\nSoon after President Trump took office, he secured the release of an Egyptian American, Aya Hijazi, jailed in Cairo for nearly three years. His administration has also negotiated the return of U.S. citizens held in North Korea, Turkey and China.\n\nThe president has portrayed the return of U.S. citizens jailed abroad as his special mission.\n\n\"We've had 17 released and we're proud of that record,\" he said in May 2018, after welcoming home Joshua Holt, who was jailed in Venezuela for nearly two years. \"I have to tell you, that was a tough situation,\" said the president.\n\nBut negotiating with Syrian officials may be tougher still.\n\n\"The U.S. government has little credibility with the Syrian government and precious little leverage against it,\" said Robert Ford, the last U.S. ambassador to serve in Syria.\n\nFord pointed to the cases of other Americans who have been arrested or gone missing in Syria, such as Austin Tice, a freelance reporter contributing to the Washington Post and McClatchy, among other outlets. Tice has been missing since 2012 and is believed held by the regime. The State Department also raised the case of Layla Shweikani, from Chicago, said Ford, \"whom the [Syrian government] executed in 2016 on suspicion of links to the opposition,\" after a trial that lasted less than a minute before the execution order was issued.\n\nKamalmaz's wife and five children, all U.S. citizens, said their father's case is different. His motives were far from political, they insisted, adding that his passion was international disaster relief. He worked in war-torn Kosovo and in Indonesia following the devastating 2004 tsunami.\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Maryam Kamalmaz\n\nIn 2012, the Syrian conflict and the swelling number of refugees became his urgent concern. He opened two mental health clinics in Lebanon, and another in Jordan. He taught traumatized refugees a stress management technique known as HeartMath.\n\n\"He helped these kids heal from fear and panic attacks, it was a high success rate,\" said Randa Ali, who worked at the center in Lebanon until it closed after his disappearance. \"He had a program set up to help kids, to help women, to help victims of torture and he was planning to start working with the elderly.\"\n\n\"He was a pioneer who addressed the mental health crisis among Syrian refugees,\" said Dr. Zaher Sahloul, who helped fund the clinics in 2014 and now heads MedGlobal, a U.S.-based nongovernmental organization that sends medical teams to disaster areas.\n\nKamalmaz knew that traveling to Syria was risky \u2014 even with an American passport, said his colleague, Renata Crescenzo, a HeartMath trainer from Jupiter, Fla. She traveled to Lebanon in 2017 to help Kamalmaz set up a program for elderly refugees.\n\nHe did not share his plans to cross the border into Syria with his staff, she said, and Crescenzo assumed his extended absence was due to a visit back to Texas to see his family. \"When his wife called, we knew something had gone wrong, \" she said. Crescenzo has kept a vigil on Facebook and said she plans to continue until he is safely out of Syria.\n\n\"He is a very special person,\" she said. \"If he's in a prison, he is sending light to his captors, that's how strong his energy is.\"\n\nKamalMaz may be one of the last U.S. citizens held in Syria's vast prison complex. His family is publicizing his case at a time when Syria's brutal civil war appears to be winding down. The time could be right for a gesture, said Stephen Rapp, who served as U.S. ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice in the Obama administration.\n\n\"This regime hopes to be readmitted to the family of nations,\" said Rapp, adding that Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have opened embassies in Damascus and Syrian officials are reaching out to Europe as the overwhelming need for backing to rebuild after eight years of a devastating conflict.\n\n\"Assad, in particular, wants the perception that he is someone you can deal with. I think it's certainly worth the effort, encouraging President Trump,\" said Rapp, adding that there are steps the Syrian government must take to make it possible to end it's pariah status and appeal for international reconstruction aid.\n\n\"Having a human being released at this point, would be a positive step.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/19/686830503/ex-chicago-police-officer-sentenced-to-17-years-for-laquan-mcdonald-murder", "text": "Ex-Chicago Police Officer Sentenced To 81 Months For Laquan McDonald Murder\n\nA day after three officers were acquitted of trying to cover up the killing, Jason Van Dyke was sent to prison for shooting the black teen 16 times. McDonald's family argues the punishment is light.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nA former Chicago police officer was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison for the 2014 fatal shooting of a black teenager. It's an end to a case that ignited protests over police shootings, prompted overhauls in their policy and changed Chicago's political landscape. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports.\n\nCHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: The sentence for Jason Van Dyke came just a day after another judge cleared three other officers accused of trying to cover up for him in this controversial case. Van Dyke faced the threat of a long prison term. Three months ago, a jury found him guilty of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery for shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times.\n\nAfter a day-long hearing yesterday, a judge sentenced Van Dyke to 81 months in prison.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDAN HERBERT: And he truly felt great.\n\nCORLEY: Dan Herbert is Van Dyke's attorney.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHERBERT: You know, he's certainly not happy about going to jail. He's certainly not happy about missing his family, but he's happy about the prospect of life ahead of him.\n\nCORLEY: It was not a decision that activists and McDonald's family had hoped for. Marvin Hunter is McDonald's great-uncle.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMARVIN HUNTER: This sentence reduced Laquan McDonald's life to a second-class citizen. And it suggests to us that there are no laws on the books for a black man that a white man is bound to honor.\n\nCORLEY: The crux of this case was a dashcam video. It contradicted police reports that said McDonald had attacked police and instead showed him walking away, knife in hand, from officers who were following him. An ensuing firestorm prompted the dismissal of the city's police superintendent and a federal investigation.\n\nWilliam Calloway, an activist who took legal steps to force the release of the video, had wanted Van Dyke to serve a much longer sentence.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nWILLIAM CALLOWAY: Eighty-one months in the Illinois Department of Corrections. That's a slap in the face to us and a slap on the wrist to him.\n\nCORLEY: At the hearing, witnesses offered two portraits of Jason Van Dyke. Edward Nance, almost weeping, recounted alleged brutal treatment at the hands of Van Dyke during a traffic stop.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nEDWARD NANCE: Well, I couldn't roll my shoulders. And I couldn't - I could do nothing.\n\nJOSEPH MCMAHON: Did you tell the defendant that you were...\n\nNANCE: Yes.\n\nMCMAHON: ...In pain and he was hurting you?\n\nNANCE: Yes.\n\nMCMAHON: Did he respond?\n\nNANCE: He said, shut up and lay down.\n\nCORLEY: Nance was awarded $350,000 in a federal lawsuit. Van Dyke's wife called her husband a gentle giant. His brother-in-law, who is black, said Van Dyke is not a racist.\n\nProsecutor Joseph McMahon had asked for an 18- to 20-year sentence. He said the shorter term holds Van Dyke accountable while recognizing his service as a police officer.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMCMAHON: That was our goal. It was not revenge, and not punishment for the misconduct of other abuse at the hands of other police officers, either in this city or other cities across the country.\n\nCORLEY: Although satisfied with the sentence, McMahon added, the case that had roiled Chicago for so many years was a tragedy on many levels.

No sooner had Trump threatened to come ahead than Pelosi made clear just how unwelcome he would be, until the partial government shutdown was over.\n\nSome had visions of Trump and a squad of Secret Service agents barging their way in, no doubt to the cheers of Republican members of Congress.\n\n\n\nNone of that was ever likely to happen. But the vision of it was dark, indeed. The fact is that the speaker can withhold House consent to the joint congressional resolution by which the president is empowered to speak. So barging in would be a breach of more than protocol.\n\n\n\nHours later, in that late-night tweet, the president backed down. Tensions eased. Some read that as a sign the stalled negotiations over homeland security (read: the president's desire for $5 billion in funding to build a wall or barrier on the border with Mexico) might be revived. By the end of Thursday, the Senate leaders of the two parties were talking to each other again.\n\nBut that was after test votes on the two parties' dueling proposals to reopen the government had failed on the Senate floor earlier in the day. The Democrats' plan attracted six Republican votes but still fell eight votes shy of the three-fifths majority required to advance the bill. The GOP alternative, based on the proposal Trump offered over the weekend, fell 10 votes shy and had the support of a single Democratic senator.\n\n\n\nBy Thursday evening, the White House was reported to be preparing language for a declaration of a national emergency, a tactic that had been mentioned before but that Trump has so far chosen not to pursue.\n\nIt's hard to find anything good to say about a government shutdown \u2014 especially the longest one in U.S. history. But at least we all know more now about something we all took for granted: the president's annual State of the Union speech to Congress in the Capitol.\n\n\n\nFar more Americans now know that the State of the Union address, or \"SOTU\" as some call it, does not need to be a speech, does not need to be delivered in person, does not need to be annual and does not need to happen in the Capitol.\n\n\n\nThe only thing required by the Constitution (Article II, Section 3) is that the president \"shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\"\n\nThat's it. Rather vague, as are many parts of the Constitution, which was, after all, a series of compromises among negotiators who were suspicious of each other and suspicious of government in general.\n\nMuch of what we assume about this giving of \"Information\" has been established by custom. President George Washington decided a report each year made sense, and he also gave the first SOTU to Congress in person in 1790 in Federal Hall in New York City, the seat of the fledgling U.S. government at the time.\n\nWashington's in-person delivery was continued by his successor, John Adams. But in 1801, the third U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson, decided the in-person speech was not for him. Jefferson disliked the similarities between this address and the manner in which the king of England in those days addressed opening sessions of Parliament to deliver his marching orders. (Some say Jefferson also disliked his own public speaking voice.)\n\nIn any event, the custom of a written speech took hold and prevailed for more than a century. It was not until Woodrow Wilson arrived in 1913 that the notion of in-person delivery was revived.\n\nWilson was a progressive Democrat and Princeton professor who apparently liked the idea of getting up to lecture in front of Congress. It was his improvement on the example of Theodore Roosevelt, who several years earlier had begun making the annual address a muscular agenda \u2014 rather than just a rundown on what was happening around the government.\n\nSo, just maybe, a delay makes sense now with the government partially shut down. (We had one in 1986 after the space shuttle Challenger blew up.)\n\nOr, just maybe, having this annual shindig \"just the way we have always have had it\" does not make sense anymore.\n\nThere is a growing sense in America that old ways of doing things do not always make sense anymore. That applies to the way we go shopping or go to the movies or go to school, all of which we can do now without going anywhere.\n\nHide caption President Franklin D. Roosevelt adresses a joint session of Congress as Speaker Sam Rayburn, left, and Vice President John N. Garner, look on. With World War II looming, Roosevelt used his 1941 address to outline the \"four freedoms,\" freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear.

Is it something everyone really has to physically attend, or is there an adaptation available? Could this annual monster meetup near the National Mall just, well, go away?\n\nWould we miss the hour-plus of speechifying and unspontaneous ovations from one side of the aisle or the other? Would we be the poorer without those hours of pregame and postgame punditry?\n\nTo be sure, something would be lost if the one truly bipartisan, bicameral, multibranch and multi-everything confab of the year disappears from the nation's capital.\n\nBut, for roughly half of our history, this ritual did not require anyone to go anywhere.\n\nFor more than 100 years, it was understood that a president's annual report to Congress would be a written document sent up to the Capitol. That's how things were from the time of Jefferson in the beginning of the 19th century until Wilson's arrival early in the 20th century.\n\nDue to ill health, Wilson went back to mailing it in for the last two years he was president. Warren Harding did two SOTU addresses in person before dying in office. Calvin Coolidge gave his first in 1923 in person and allowed it to be broadcast on the radio. Then Coolidge went back to the written report, which Herbert Hoover also favored.\n\nBut starting with Franklin Roosevelt, the full value of the SOTU was appreciated and expanded upon. FDR used it to proclaim his \"four freedoms,\" LBJ to announce his war on poverty and Richard Nixon to say \"one year of Watergate is enough.\"\n\nIn the 1930s, the radio microphone became a fixture, followed by one for TV in 1947. And the presumption took hold that the president was addressing not only Congress but an entire nation \u2014 listening and watching on an ever-expanding array of electronic devices.\n\nThe SOTU itself has become a kind of electronic device and one of the most powerful a president has.\n\nOver the years, there must have been times when Capitol Hill leaders wished they could lift that powerful device deftly from the hands of the president and put it on a shelf. But even those speakers of the House most at loggerheads with a president have felt they had to issue the routine invitation and sit there and take it. To do otherwise would have been unthinkable.\n\nUntil now.\n\nSo what will happen next?\n\nThursday the president said basically it's up to Pelosi. \"It's really her choice,\" Trump said, \"I would have done it in a different place but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union \u2014 to pick some other place. I could have done it. I could have gone to a big auditorium and gotten 25,000 people in one day.\"\n\nThe president added: \"But I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union. So what she said I thought was actually reasonable: We'll have the State of the Union when the shutdown is over.\"\n\nAsked when that might be, Trump replied with \"That I can't tell you, that I can't tell you. But, we have a lot of alternatives \u2014 but we need border security.\"\n\nHouse Republican leaders had speculated last week that another venue on the Hill (like the GOP-controlled Senate chamber) might be found anytime the president of the United States wishes to speak. And surely that's true. And this week Trump received multiple offers from GOP governors who offered up their statehouses as alternative sites.\n\nBut does it make sense to do this speech at this time in any other place than the House floor? Or \u2014 as Trump seemed to concede this week in bowing to Pelosi \u2014 does a change from the traditional venue sap too much of the tradition, glory and grandeur?\n\nAnd as long as we are asking questions, let us return to one posed a moment ago: Does it make sense to gather all these people at once the way we do, largely to project a false sense of unity?\n\nPerhaps the best answer is another question: Would we be better off with no national show of unity at all?"}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/19/686299832/i-m-falling-apart-shutdown-squeeze-tightens-for-low-wage-workers", "text": "'I'm Falling Apart': Shutdown Squeeze Tightens For Low-Wage Workers\n\nReceiving a $0 pay stub is not easy on any worker. But some of the thousands of federal employees and contract workers who live paycheck to paycheck say the lingering partial government shutdown feels devastating. They started the shutdown with little or no savings and no safety net to weather this kind of financial emergency.\n\nNow, one month into the shutdown, even those who had a cushion are finding their bank accounts empty or negative and bills and loan payments piling up.\n\nThey are single parents and large families, many still working long hours to keep the nation's airports and prisons secure. One mom says she is skipping meals so her kids can eat. Another says she is \"falling apart.\"\n\n\"I have no money,\" says T. Miller. \"I don't know how much longer I can stay on this job.\"\n\nMiller is a newly minted Transportation Security Administration officer who works at a busy airport in the Washington, D.C., area. NPR isn't using his full name because the TSA doesn't allow its employees to speak publicly. He became a government employee last December and makes about $32,000.\n\nMiller makes much less than most federal workers in his region. In the areas surrounding D.C., such workers tend to have high salaries \u2014 $95,212 is the average for Virginia \u2014 and those working in lower-income jobs are spread throughout the country.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn some states with high numbers of federal employees affected by the shutdown, low pay combined with higher costs of living make it even more of a challenge for those who suddenly find themselves without a paycheck.\n\nElizabeth Kandror, a clerk with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Homer, Alaska, makes about $37,000 per year. She has been a federal employee for three years, and she says she didn't expect the shutdown to last this long.\n\n\"It's so unbelievable,\" she says. \"This is what we've come down to \u2014 the 'greatest nation' on earth?\" she asks, her voice rising.\n\nAfter Washington, D.C., Alaska has the highest percentage of civilian federal employees who work for agencies affected by the shutdown in a single state: 14 per 1,000 Alaska workers, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Its cost of living is also among the highest in the country, according the Commerce Department's \"price parity\" index.\n\nAnd yet the average paycheck for federal employees there is near the middle of all states: about $77,000 a year.\n\nThere is a caveat: The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't break out how much federal employees make in different agencies. So the wage data available include both workers affected and not affected by the shutdown (some agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Labor have been funded by Congress for the current fiscal year).\n\nThe majority of those affected by the shutdown in Alaska work for the Interior and Transportation departments.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Elizabeth Kandror Courtesy of Elizabeth Kandror\n\n\"I did file for unemployment and got $300,\" Kandror says. That will help them get through the end of the month. The single mom says she is fortunate not to have rent payments because she lives in a cabin on her parents' land. But she, too, lives paycheck to paycheck, and if the shutdown continues beyond January, she says she will probably have to go on welfare.\n\nKandror is the mother of a 3-year-old boy. She says she has funds to pay for day care next month, but that's about it. She had to wait nine months to get her son in day care and fears losing that spot if she can't pay.\n\nShe says she will need to find other work, but it will be hard because Homer is a seasonal town and there aren't a lot of jobs in the wintertime. \"That's why I was so grateful to get this federal job \u2014 because it's year-round,\" she says.\n\nTo be sure, not all areas with high concentrations of federal employees are taking home smaller paychecks. Maryland and Virginia, home to many federal workers in the D.C. suburbs, are the two states where they make the most on average: $107,536 and $95,212, respectively.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images Mark Makela/Getty Images\n\nIn the red\n\nAbout 14 percent of federal employees make under $50,000 a year, according to government data.\n\nAmy Fellows is a 33-year-old single mom of three kids \u2014 ages 10, 3 and 1.\n\nShe has been skipping meals for days now to make sure her kids have enough to eat.\n\nFellows is a correctional officer in Arizona and works for the Federal Bureau of Prisons making $49,000 a year. She is also working with no pay because she is considered essential \u2014 sometimes clocking in a 16-hour day.\n\n\"I want to make sure my kids have that food,\" says Fellows. \"I was able to pay for my rent and my utilities, but now I have nothing in my bank.\"\n\nActually, she is already in the red \u2014 her bank account has a negative balance of $400.\n\n\"I've actually had to call out three times because I can't afford day care,\" she says. Day care is $200 a week for her two youngest kids. She often feels like having to choose between staying home and taking care of her two youngest children or going to work. She is worried about losing her job.\n\nFederal employees will get back pay when the government reopens. But until then, many are part of the 40 percent of Americans who would not be able to afford an unexpected $400 expense, according to Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute. They are completely dependent on every single bimonthly paycheck to cover the basics \u2014 rent, utilities and food.\n\nJacinda's husband is a TSA screener in Oregon.

Unlike government employees, contractors will most likely not get back pay once the government reopens.\n\nZachary Schindler is a federal contractor at the Earth Resources Observation and Science Center in South Dakota. He's a cook in the cafeteria \u2014 one of the hardest-hit sectors because they are typically minimum-wage employees, often with few or no benefits.\n\n\"I'm falling behind,\" says Schindler. He has been on the job for about three years, and he and his wife had built a cushion toward buying a house. But their savings are now gone, he says, and they are \"just living paycheck to paycheck again.\"\n\nThey have car loans, rent, mobile phones, utility and food bills. \"We are struggling to see how we are going to pay our next bills,\" he says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Zachary Schindler Courtesy of Zachary Schindler\n\nSchindler, 29, and his wife are the parents of a 2-year-old son. They had to pull him out of day care because they could no longer afford the $400-per-month fee.\n\nSchindler says he is staying away from news, especially political news. \"It makes me angry,\" he says.\n\n\"I'm applying to anything I can,\" including jobs outside his expertise, like county appraiser. Just not the federal government.\n\nPeople like Schindler could feel the shutdown pain even more deeply if it drags on even further, says Paul Light, professor of public service at New York University who studies the workforce. He estimates that 4.1 million people work under federal contracts (there is no national database that tracks these workers). He says it is people who work for small companies, like cooks on contract, who may lose their jobs entirely because of the shutdown.\n\n\"That's where you would expect to see some pretty significant impacts of even a two-week shutdown,\" says Light, \"because the smaller the business, the more likely it is to lay off workers at the first sign that there might be a delay in payment.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure how they'll recover if this shutdown continues much longer,\" he says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nPlan A, B, C\n\nMany federal workers and contractors NPR spoke to expressed frustration at the Trump administration and Congress for allowing the shutdown to persist.\n\nKandror, with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska, says she has called her two senators to express her frustration but hasn't heard back. \"I feel like my life has been hijacked,\" she says. She wants both parties to work together for a solution, she says, \"but not on our backs.\"\n\nFellows, the correctional officer in Arizona, says she feels politicians are thinking only of their own political gain.\n\nMiller, the TSA officer working in the Washington, D.C., area, is one of many federal workers now looking for a new job. He says he has already called his former boss and has applied to other jobs as well.\n\n\"I have to have Plan A, B and C in motion,\" he says. Plan A is hanging on to his government job, Plan B is going back to his gym work and C is work elsewhere. He takes a long pause and a deep breath before he says, \"I can hang on to this job for about two more weeks\" and that's a stretch, he says. If the shutdown isn't resolved after that \u2014 \"it's the no-turning-back kind of phase.\"\n\n\"My expenses are low,\" Miller says, but he has bills to pay \u2014 like credit cards, a car loan and college loans. He has been in contact with his creditors, and though he says they are giving him an extension, he doesn't know for how long.\n\nHe says he feels fortunate compared with other TSA colleagues but is still worried. \"I feel like I'm going backwards,\" he says.\n\nMiller graduated from college in 2004 and worked as a physical trainer at a local gym for seven years with no benefits and no retirement. He joined TSA \"because the government is the most stable employer.\"\n\n\"I had big dreams for this job,\" he says. \"I went into it planning to make it a career.\" He says he planned to use his entry-level job as a steppingstone in what he envisioned as a long career.\n\nThe government offers good benefits, he says, but working without pay is raising his anxiety level. It was never part of Miller's plan.\n\nLeila Fadel, Koko Nakajima and David Welna contributed to this report."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2019/01/16/684812592/i-m-a-survivor-of-violence-portraits-of-women-waiting-in-mexico-for-u-s-asylum", "text": "'I'm A Survivor Of Violence': Portraits Of Women Waiting In Mexico For U.S. Asylum\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Federica Valabrega Federica Valabrega\n\nUpdated Thursday at 5:35 p.m. ET\n\n\"Hitting a woman for a man is as normal as eating a tortilla from a food stand on the way to work,\" said Karen Paz, 34, from San Pedro Sula in Honduras, revealing a scar from a burn on her left shoulder. \"He wanted to burn my face, but my daughter started screaming when she saw him taking the pan with boiling butter.

Between 2009 and 2012, 82,547 domestic violence complaints were lodged in courts across the country. Yet a low percentage of domestic abuse charges result in a conviction. Honduras' special prosecutor for women cited far lower numbers in the 2012-2014 period: 4,992 registered complaints, but just 134 convictions, according to the U.N. report. The Migration Policy Institute found that El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, respectively, had the first-, third- and seventh-highest rate of gender-motivated killing of women in the world.

For them it was a challenging, almost two-month journey to answer the question: What does it take for a Central American woman to give her children a better future?\n\nI listened to these women's testimonies and decided to portray them not as victims but as their most resilient selves, for no abuse can measure up to the courage and strength it took to carry their children across multiple countries for a shot at a better life by asking for asylum in the United States.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Federica Valabrega Federica Valabrega\n\nAt least one of the Central American women I met, Maria Lidia Meza Castro, 39, later managed to enter the United States \u2014 escorted by a group including two U.S. Congress members \u2014 and reportedly asked for asylum along with five of her children.

So let's listen to some warming songs from Eastern Europe that celebrate the season upon us.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MOMCI KOLEDARCI\")\n\nKITKA WOMEN'S VOCAL ENSEMBLE: (Singing in Bulgarian).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The album \"Evening Star\" features harmonies unique to Balkan, Slavic and Caucasian lands. But here's the twist - they're served up by Kitka, a vocal ensemble of many years standing based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Shira Cion is the group's artistic director. She joins us from the studios of KQED. Welcome.\n\nSHIRA CION: So great to be here, Lulu. Thank you.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Also with us is Kelly Atkins. She's another Kitkat - I think that's what you call yourselves, right?\n\nKELLY ATKINS: It is, yes. Hi.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Hi. Shira, I'm going to start with you. You're quoted in the press notes saying this music springs from a, quote, \"instinct to come together and sing in the deep, dark heart of wintertime.\" I love that, by the way. Does this music help bring up the body temperature?\n\nCION: They actually think it probably does. And it's been interesting. You know, so many studies are now coming out about sort of the physical and cognitive and social benefits of harmony singing and choral singing. And I think all the science is just proving something that Eastern European villagers have known for centuries, which is that when times are tough, when weather conditions are cold, where merely surviving through a difficult season really calls upon communities to come together, it's a time to sing. And I think singing does lift spirits. It does sort of synchronize our organisms together. I really do believe it helps us survive through trying times.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Kelly, that image of the deep, dark heart of wintertime is also a metaphor, I guess, of the kind of music that this is. Tell me what - how you see it.\n\nATKINS: Well, we also use the metaphor of the cycles of life. Some of the songs, as you probably noticed, from the album are literally about winter. And some of them are about the winter of life. So we kind of see a lot of the songs that we sing not only about the holidays themselves but about the cycles that we go through in our own lives.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's listen to a bit of the title track. It's a Bulgarian song - \"Evening Star.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ZVEZDA VECERNICA\")\n\nKITKA WOMEN'S VOCAL ENSEMBLE: (Singing in Bulgarian).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I got to tell you, it feels like something deeply thrumming and ancient. You know, it comes - it really comes from this sort of essential place. It really does. It's amazing. Kelly, I understand you have a background as an indie rocker. What got you interested in Eastern European vocal music?\n\nATKINS: Well, the first time I saw the Bulgarian Women's Choir, I was at Grace Cathedral. And I sat in the pews and just wept. And I couldn't figure out what was happening to me. And it just rocked me on a very, very deep level. So I think that was my gateway drug, as we call it in the group. Most of us have our gateway drug of Bulgarian choir music.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter) Shira, people also may be surprised to learn that there's actually many vocal groups here in the states specializing in Eastern European music. There's Kitka. There's Planina based in Denver. There's the Yale Slavic Chorus, which has been around almost 50 years. What do you think makes...\n\nCION: Yes.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...The music so irresistible to female vocalists?\n\nCION: Well, I think for those of us who I would say identify as liberal American feminists, there's something about the quality of powerful women's voices joined together in this very physical, very close harmony, sometimes dissonant harmony configurations that really appeals to a contemporary American female sensibility.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED KITKA SONG)\n\nKITKA WOMEN'S VOCAL ENSEMBLE: (Singing in foreign language).\n\nCION: And these are cultures where labor was traditionally divided by gender. And women were accustomed to creating in community and creating music together in community. We were actually just talking about this in the greenroom earlier today - how all of us who sing in Kitka are much more oriented towards kind of collective and harmony singing than individualistic, soloistic singing. And I think it sort of counters the sort of strongly individualistic trend that America values so much. It's, like...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Exactly.\n\nCION: ...Everyone to...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The solo artist.\n\nCION: ...Themself (ph).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah.\n\nCION: The solo artist. And this is really a communal form that can really only take flight when there's a community of people participating in it.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's listen now to a Ukrainian carol from your album.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"V HOSPODARON'KA\")\n\nKITKA WOMEN'S VOCAL ENSEMBLE: (Singing in Ukrainian).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So this is actually a Ukrainian carol for New Year's. And you actually traveled there a while back and met up with a Ukrainian group. What about your other travels to perform in Eastern Europe? What's been the reaction from audiences?\n\nATKINS: We were in Serbia about - was it five years ago?\n\nCION: Yeah, 2013.\n\nATKINS: And it was my first time with Kitka traveling abroad and singing Serbian music to Serbians. And I honestly was nervous going. I was thinking, who am I as an American to go and sing these songs in front of these people where, you know, they have these deep roots with these songs? But in fact, we were received very warmly. And it was really a cathartic experience for both the audience and for us.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So, Kelly and Shira, this is to both of you. What's your favorite song on the album?\n\nCION: Oh, that's a tough one.\n\nATKINS: It is.\n\nCION: What do you think about maybe \"Blazentsv\"?\n\nATKINS: Maybe \"Blazentsv.\"\n\nCION: Yeah. This isn't technically a winter song. But it's a song that we feel articulates qualities that we all try to summon in ourselves during the holiday season. It's a musical setting of \"The Beatitudes\" by the Russian composer Vladimir Martynov. And, you know, these are calling the listener to embody qualities of generosity and compassion and kindness, living simply so that others might simply live and seeing that true contentment really comes from kind of going against the grain of greed and egoism and materialism and violence and living gently, living kindly so that others can feel the kingdom of heaven here on Earth.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That is a good holiday message. Shira Cion and Kelly Atkins from the Kitka Woman's Vocal Ensemble. Their new album is called \"Evening Star.\" Thank you both very much.\n\nCION: Thank you so much for having us.\n\nATKINS: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ZAPOVEDI BLAZENSTV/ THE BEATITUDES\")\n\nKITKA WOMEN'S VOCAL ENSEMBLE: (Singing in Russian).\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

In recent years, cities including the Democratic strongholds of Milwaukee and Madison have offered several weeks of early voting.\n\nFormer Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed the new restrictions into law roughly three weeks before he was to leave office and be replaced by Democrat Tony Evers. The same lame-duck session of the Legislature also sought to curb Evers' powers, in a move widely criticized as a power play.\n\nLiberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now joined with the National Redistricting Foundation, an arm of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee headed by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, to argue that the new restrictions violated a 2016 federal ruling on election laws in Wisconsin. The groups appealed to the judge in that case, Judge James Peterson of the Western District of Wisconsin, to block the new law.\n\nPeterson issued a favorable ruling for the groups on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"This is not a close question,\" Peterson wrote in his decision.\n\nThe judge also struck down a law passed during the lame duck session that requires a 2-year expiration date on student IDs used for identification at the polls, as well as a law that limits the use of receipts as valid voter identification for individuals who are involved in a sometimes lengthy process of getting a valid ID without a birth certificate.\n\nAnaliese Eicher, program director at One Wisconsin Now, lauded Peterson's decision as a victory for Wisconsin voters.\n\n\"We saw voters respond incredibly when voting was expanded in Wisconsin - voters stepped up, they saw the ability to vote and they voted,\" she said.\n\nEicher said the ruling will allow communities to continue to provide \"the kinds of voting experiences that they need.\"\n\nEarly voting in Wisconsin has increased steadily since 2016. More than 547,000 absentee ballots were cast in the state during the 2018 election, which set a new record for early voting turnout for a midterm election, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Holder said the ruling should serve as a rebuke to former Gov. Walker and \"his cronies in the state legislature.\"\n\n\"Every voter in the state should be asking one question: Why are Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature so afraid of the people they claim they want to represent?\" Holder said. \"Though we are heartened by this decision, we will continue to fight any further efforts designed to undermine democracy in Wisconsin or any other part of our nation.\"\n\nRepublican supporters of the early voting limitation argued it created a level playing field for voting across the state. They said it was unfair that some communities offered several weeks of early voting while others, particularly rural areas, could not afford to do so.\n\nThough Peterson's new ruling blocks the restrictions for now, the case is pending appeal before a federal appellate court."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/686227606/heads-up-for-sunday-a-super-blood-moon-is-on-the-way", "text": "Heads-Up For Sunday, A Super 'Blood Moon' Is On The Way\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrik Stollarz/AFP/Getty Images Patrik Stollarz/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 9:50 p.m. ET\n\nA special celestial event is on the calendar for this Sunday night and experts are already raving:\n\n\"A full 62 luxurious minutes of totality,\" says Sky and Telescope Magazine.\n\n\"The Only Total Lunar Eclipse of 2019,\" promises NASA.\n\n\"This full moon will appear to be one of the largest of 2019,\" reports Space.com.\n\nNorth and South America will get the best view of the super \"blood moon,\" as it's known, but Europeans and Africans will also be able to watch (weather permitting).

That can only happen when the moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the sun. About once a month, a full moon is visible when it nears that far point and shines brightly as Earth covers up most of the sun. But approximately once a year, as the moon travels along its tilted axis, it ends up directly behind Earth and is thrust into near darkness.\n\nAt 9:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, the moon will start to creep into the part of Earth's shadow known as the penumbra. Not much darkening will be visible yet, according to NASA.\n\nBy 10:33 p.m. ET, you should see Earth's shadow start to move across the surface of the moon, growing larger and larger and larger until it completely covers it up.\n\n11:41 p.m. ET will mark the totality of the eclipse, as the moon is fully shaded by Earth. That's where the \"blood\" comes in. There's no violence involved. Instead, the term comes from a reddening of the moon as light leaks around the edge of Earth.\n\ntoggle caption NASA\n\nThe moon will stay bathed in our colorful shadow for more than an hour before orbiting back out into the sunlight.\n\nAs NASA explains, Earth casts a red shadow because of how our atmosphere scatters light. During our days, sunlight coming in from up high is scattered. Short blue lightwaves are bounced around, leaving us with blue skies. But when the sun comes in at an angle \u2014 at sunset, sunrise or from the perspective of the moon on the other side of Earth \u2014 the sun's reddish light becomes dominant. That light can also change based on dust, pollutants or other particles in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nSo what about the \"super\" part of Sunday's show in the sky? The moon's orbit around Earth is not perfectly round, so as it circles Earth it is sometimes closer and sometimes farther away, by a distance of about 26,000 miles. That means that when the moon is at its closest point to Earth \u2014 known as the perigee \u2014 it can appear up to 17 percent larger than it does at the farthest point in its orbit. Sunday's eclipse will almost coincide with that perigee, meaning that the moon won't just be redder than usual, it will also look a tiny bit wider.\n\nIf you're a visual learner, NASA has you covered:\n\nIt won't take any special equipment to see the total eclipse \u2014 no telescopes or dark glasses required. The main impediment to experiencing the relatively rare phenomenon? Weather.\n\nMidwesterners and Southerners should get a good look at the big, red moon. But National Weather Service cloud-cover forecasts show that the Northeast and much of the West might have their views obscured.\n\nIf you can't catch the eclipse through your window, you can always watch it livestreamed on a screen. Or you can just wait for the Instagram posts.\n\nAs NPR's Rebecca Hersher has reported, the moon will get its shadowy revenge in a few years: \"There will be solar eclipses visible from parts of the contiguous U.S. on Oct. 14, 2023, and April 8, 2024. The one in 2024 will be a total solar eclipse visible from Texas to Maine.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/686169529/trump-unveils-ambitious-missile-defense-plans", "text": "Trump Unveils Ambitious Missile Defense Plans\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wright/Missile Defense Agency Mark Wright/Missile Defense Agency\n\nUpdated at 5:47 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump unveiled a sweeping plan Thursday to defend the U.S. and its allies from missile attack.\n\nThe plan is the first update to the nation's missile defense strategy in nearly a decade, but in many ways it is reminiscent of President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, a pie-in-the-sky program that was later dubbed \"Star Wars.\"\n\nThe report outlines a battery of new technologies \u2014 including lasers and space-based systems \u2014 that the Pentagon wants to combat what it deems to be a growing missile threat. It also calls for adding 20 interceptor missiles to an existing system of 44 interceptors based in Fort Greely, Alaska.\n\n\"Our goal is simple,\" Trump said at a Pentagon briefing on Thursday. \"To ensure that we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere, anytime, anyplace.\"\n\nCritics were quick to point out that meeting this goal would cost many billions of dollars.\n\n\"It would be incredibly costly,\" says Laura Grego, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists who tracks missile defense programs. Grego says that Trump's comments hark back to the days of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. That program cost billions, and in the end, its vision of a space-based blanket defense against nuclear attack proved to be too technically challenging.\n\nThe Pentagon's last review of missile defense was conducted in 2010, under President Barack Obama. That earlier review emphasized the threat from nations such as Iran and North Korea and called for a limited defense that could stop them.\n\nThings have changed since then.\n\nNorth Korea has successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States. China and Russia, meanwhile, are working on advanced weapons that can, in theory, evade existing missile defenses.\n\nThe new review still calls out Iran, and it describes North Korea as an \"extraordinary threat,\" despite ongoing talks between the North and the Trump administration.\n\nBut it also focuses heavily on Russia and China, which are developing defense-foiling systems such as a nuclear-powered cruise missile and hypersonic weapons capable of flying at more than five times the speed of sound.\n\n\"The U.S. will now adjust its posture to also defend against any missile strikes including cruise and hypersonic missiles,\" Trump said.\n\nThat adjustment could lead to an arms race, warns Vipin Narang, an arms control expert at MIT. The explicit calling out of Russian and Chinese weapons might provide a political opportunity for those nations to accelerate their programs, he argues. \"This will be a gift for Putin.\"\n\nBut others say that an arms race is already underway.\n\n\"We will always be in an arms race, whether you want to be or not,\" says Trey Obering, a former head of the Missile Defense Agency who is now an executive vice president at the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\nObering says the new missile defense review is \"just in time,\" given the evolving threats facing the nation. He adds that a lot has changed since the 1980s. Advances in materials, computation and rocketry have all made missile defense cheaper than ever, he says.\n\nTom Karako with the Center for Strategic and International Studies adds that the Pentagon's ambitions as written in the report are more modest than Trump's goal of destroying any missile on the planet. \"I think that's a fine aspiration,\" Karako says. \"But from my reading of the document, it says something a little bit less.\" Most of the money for advanced systems like lasers will be restricted initially to R&D, he says.\n\nOverall, it remains unclear how much of Trump's missile defense strategy will become a reality. In his speech, the president implied that wealthy allies of the U.S. might help pay for the defenses, but physicist Grego says it is more likely that members of Congress will be the ones who will authorize funding.\n\n\"The Democratic House will be much more skeptical than previous Congresses,\" she predicts. \"He'll have a tough time moving a lot of this stuff through.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/686124390/thursday-january-17th-2019", "text": "Thursday, January 17th, 2019 The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll results show President Trump losing support from key parts of his base.

President Trump and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives remain deadlocked over his demand for border wall funding in order to reopen the government. A new NPR/Ipsos poll shows that Americans are mostly fed up with the stalemate and pessimistic about the direction of their country. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nDEBBIE ELLIOT, BYLINE: Federal workers rallied at the Capitol this week to send a message to Congress and the White House.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Chanting) Open the government.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Today.\n\nELLIOT: An estimated 800,000 federal workers are affected by the partial government shutdown, including LeRoy McCray who works, currently without pay, at Reagan National Airport.\n\nLEROY MCCRAY: I'm showing up to work every day. I'm doing my job. I'm doing a service for this country, and I'm not getting paid. To me, that is un-American.\n\nELLIOT: He says the standoff is changing his outlook on the direction of the country.\n\nMCCRAY: It's becoming harder and harder to remain optimistic.\n\nELLIOT: The NPR/Ipsos poll shows a majority of Americans are similarly frustrated with the shutdown and the state of politics in general.\n\nLISA WEST: I think it's very embarrassing.\n\nELLIOT: Survey respondent Lisa West is a 58-year-old independent from San Luis Obispo, Calif.\n\nWEST: I think it makes us look stupid. And I think it makes us look like we're children and unable to behave like adults and make compromises.\n\nELLIOT: West's views are in line with three-quarters of Americans according to the NPR/Ipsos poll. The online survey of about 1,000 people was conducted January 9 and 10.\n\nResearch director Mallory Newall of the Ipsos polling company says the sentiment was clear.\n\nMALLORY NEWALL: No one in Washington really is coming out of this with a stronger standing among the American public.\n\nELLIOT: Newall says two-thirds of those surveyed said they were not personally affected by the shutdown. Nonetheless...\n\nNEWALL: They see it as a black mark on the country. It's embarrassing. And that sentiment of embarrassment and frustration works across party lines. So you have even over half of Republicans, for example, saying that the shutdown is embarrassing for the country and that it's going to hurt our country.\n\nKAREN MURPHY: My name is Karen Murphy, and I live and work in Huntsville, Ala.\n\nELLIOT: Murphy is a NASA contractor, and the work she's doing is funded into February, but she's not been able to talk to government employees who've been furloughed in the shutdown.\n\nMURPHY: It's holding people hostage who just want to do their jobs.\n\nELLIOT: Murphy, who identifies as a political independent, puts the blame on both Congress and the president.\n\nMURPHY: Neither side comes out of this blameless.\n\nELLIOT: The poll found that a majority of Americans are optimistic about their personal finances but more pessimistic about the direction of the country, although those results were split along party lines. Republicans are more optimistic, with Democrats and independents, like Karen Murphy, more pessimistic.\n\nMURPHY: I think right now the country doesn't have much of a direction. I have never seen this much confusion. You know, that's - it's kind of scary because I keep looking at this, and I don't necessarily see a good way out.\n\nELLIOT: But a third of Americans do see a way out - funding a border wall.\n\nJAMES NICHOLS: I think it's a good idea.\n\nELLIOT: James Nichols ducks between buildings to escape the bitter cold in Lincoln, N.H. He works for a company that manufactures aluminum parts and is concerned about people coming into the country illegally.\n\nNICHOLS: A lot of the immigrants that are coming over here that don't have the card, the legal documents to be in the United States.\n\nELLIOT: Nichols says he thinks it's worth shutting down the government until the border is secure. That's a sentiment according to the NPR/Ipsos poll shared by nearly 1 in 3 Americans.\n\nDebbie Elliott, NPR News.\n\nSIMON: And, of course, that's the sentiment of President Trump, who has ramped up efforts to try to secure funding for a border wall.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we say James Nichols is trying to escape the bitter cold in Lincoln, N.H.

Along with other reporters, he will be covering the cleanup and recovery effort in and around Paradise. If you want to share your story email natdesk@npr.org with \"Paradise\" in the subject line.\n\nThe quaint, college town and farming hub of Chico is clogged. People are living out of every hotel in town. Campers line neighborhood streets and the country roads that fan out into the walnut and citrus orchards. Every guesthouse and guest room is full.\n\n\"I live in a bedroom, I've lost everything I had,\" says Brian Grahlman, 70, one of thousands of victims of last November's Camp Fire that nearly destroyed the town of Paradise, 15 miles from Chico.\n\nGrahlman narrowly escaped the fire. Now he's living in a spare room in his daughter's house in Chico. His home in Paradise is gone. His wife has to stay with her daughter nearby.\n\n\"Everybody I know is living with somebody else,\" he says.\n\nBefore the Camp Fire, the small city of Chico in Butte County was already grappling with a severe housing shortage \u2014 vacancy rates for the county routinely hovered between 1 and 2 percent. Rents far outpaced wages and homelessness was rising.\n\nLike a lot of rural communities, the area has also been hard hit by the opioid crisis and other addiction issues that are straining health care and police.\n\nThen, literally overnight, Chico's bedroom community of Paradise almost entirely burned to the ground: 19,000 buildings were destroyed, and thousands of people were displaced. According to one of the world's leading reinsurers, Germany's Munich Re, the Camp Fire was deemed the most expensive natural disaster in the world in 2018.\n\nMore than two months later, there's a sense of a slow, simmering crisis in Chico.\n\n\"There is no plan\"\n\nIt's estimated that Chico has had to take in up to 20,000 new people. There's been a 30 percent spike in traffic accidents. Crime is up. Classrooms are overflowing.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR Kirk Siegler/NPR\n\n\"The people who live here are just as stressed as we are who have moved here,\" Grahlman says. \"It's very difficult and there's no short term solution.\"\n\nSo what is the plan?\n\n\"The plan is, there is no plan,\" says Chico Mayor Randall Stone. \"As scary as that sounds it's just a world that we have to get used to.\"\n\nStone became mayor not long after the Camp Fire ignited. His town's infrastructure just wasn't built for the influx of fire refugees, he says, particularly the roads. The thousands of newcomers don't always know where they're going.\n\n\"As you're driving around it feels like everyone's constantly looking for an address,\" Stone says. \"We're the traffic equivalent of a clogged toilet.\"\n\nPulling disaster funds?\n\nIn terms of short-term solutions, this rural region has had no choice but to rely heavily on state and federal disaster funds. So folks here reacted with shock and confusion when President Trump threatened to cut off federal disaster aid in a tweet about how federal forests are managed in California.\n\nThe bulk of the forests in this state are either privately owned or managed by the federal government. But officials like Stone didn't have time to try to decipher or fact-check the president's tweet.\n\nThe Trump Twitter scare seemed to follow a pattern. One day it looks like things might be getting better, and then there's another setback.\n\n\"You have the president of the United States saying that he's yanking back FEMA funding already,\" Stone says. \"I don't think we took too much to heart but you can see how volatile things get.\"\n\nChico is fully occupied\n\nThe single most immediate concern is what to do about the nearly 700 people who \u2014 more than two months on \u2014 are still living in their cars or RVs at a Red Cross shelter at the Chico fairgrounds.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR Kirk Siegler/NPR\n\nThe Red Cross is expected to pull up stakes at the end of the month. But the shelter is still seeing new arrivals. After weeks of couch surfing or paying out of pocket for a hotel, people have nowhere else to go.\n\n\"Literally we are playing a game of musical chairs,\" says Ed Mayer, director of the Housing Authority of Butte County. \"In order for someone to find a home in Chico, somebody has to leave Chico, because we are fully, fully occupied.\"\n\nFive of Mayer's employees lost their homes in the fire, and most of the rest of his staff are housing displaced families. Federal HUD staffers moved into his office recently to work with his office to find willing landlords across the entire western U.S. Fire victims have already been relocated to Idaho, Montana, Arizona, Utah and Colorado.\n\nSince the fire, Mayer has been saying what a lot of other people are afraid to say: Folks are going to have to move out of the region.\n\n\"We may have natural disasters like the Camp Fire, but we [also] have man-made disasters,\" Mayer says.\n\nCalifornia communities are simply not able to absorb a large natural disaster like the Camp Fire, Mayer says, because the region also has an ongoing housing shortage. It's widely feared that, with climate change and future wildfires, the housing crunch could only get worse.\n\nMany Chico leaders point to the irony that, in a region with an ongoing affordable housing crisis, if and when Paradise rebuilds, the new town will probably have tougher building codes and be more expensive.\n\nAnd that new town won't even happen for years."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/01/14/684118974/from-couch-potato-to-fitness-buff-how-i-learned-to-love-exercise", "text": "From Couch Potato To Fitness Buff: How I Learned To Love Exercise\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saviour Giyorges / EyeEm/Getty Images/EyeEm Premium Saviour Giyorges / EyeEm/Getty Images/EyeEm Premium\n\nIf you like this article, you should check out Life Kit, NPR's new family of podcasts for navigating your life \u2014 everything from finances to diet and exercise to raising kids.

Back then, like a lot of Americans, I was mostly sedentary (unless you count walking to meetings). Which is ironic, because, as a senior editor for NPR's science, food and health team, it is literally my job to know better. But, with two small kids, a full-time job and recurring insomnia, I didn't have the time or energy to work out. And I'm not going tell you how much I used to weigh, but it wasn't healthy.\n\nSo what changed? For starters, I reframed what I thought of as exercise.\n\n\"The research does now show that basically all movement counts, and anything is better than nothing,\" says Michelle Segar, a psychologist and director of the University of Michigan Sport, Health and Activity Research and Policy Center. She studies how we sustain healthy behaviors, and she says one big stumbling block for people is that they fail to take advantage of the exercise opportunities they can build into their daily lives, like taking the stairs or walking to work.\n\n\"I've been astounded that even up until today, very educated people don't know \u2014 don't believe \u2014 that walking actually 'counts' as valid exercise,\" she says.\n\nThat was a big hang-up for me. I used to think if I wasn't sweaty or huffing away on the treadmill for at least a half-hour straight, why bother?\n\nBut so much more counts as moderate exercise, science now tells us. There's actually a pretty geeky but cool scientific resource called the Compendium of Physical Activities. It's used by researchers to compare apples and oranges when it comes to exercise. And it uses a value called a MET, or metabolic equivalent.\n\n\"Just sitting, doing nothing, is a MET value of 1 \u2014 you're working at your resting metabolic rate,\" explains Loretta DiPietro, an exercise research scientist at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health. \"An activity that, say, is 2 METs makes you work at twice your resting metabolic rate. So getting up and walking across the room is about 2 METS.\"\n\nDiPietro says the Compendium lists the MET values for all kinds of activities \u2014 everything from mopping (that's about 3.5 METS) to line dancing. (That can be almost 8 METS!)\n\nBut to count as moderately intense exercise, the magic number you want to hit is between 3 and 6 METS. (Alas, even the most vigorous sexual activity falls just short of that, according to the Compendium \u2014 though DiPietro suggests with a laugh that more research may be needed.)\n\nTurns out, lots of regular activities meet the magic mark. Climb the stairs slowly and that's 4 METs. Climb them quickly and it's nearly 9 METS, which means you're burning nearly nine times as many calories as you would just sitting. Even vacuuming counts, if you do it with gusto.\n\nAnd researchers now know that the health benefits of these little movements add up. Just taking short breaks to get out of your chair and walk throughout the day can help regulate blood sugar and blood pressure, helping to ward off diseases like Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. And while it won't make you an athlete, moving throughout the day, even in short but repeated spurts, has been linked to a lower risk of dying prematurely. When you think of it as something that can be broken down throughout the day, the idea of getting at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week \u2014 as federal guidelines recommend -- becomes less daunting.\n\n\"Think about it like putting pennies in a piggy bank,\" says DiPietro. \"You think, 'Oh, I'm putting in three pennies here,' and you're thinking, 'Oh, this doesn't add up to much.' But at the end of the month, it does indeed.\"\n\nKnowing this really changed the way I think about exercise. Instead of seeing exercise as all or nothing, I started to think about it like climbing a ladder. It's OK to start at the bottom rung and work your way up. So I started with small bursts of movement throughout my day. Instead of sending an email to a co-worker, I'd walk over and talk to them. I'd skip the elevator and take the stairs. I'd do squats at my desk and take short walks around the office whenever I could fit it in. I'd do one-on-one meetings with co-workers while walking and talking.\n\nThe more I did, the stronger I felt \u2014 and the more I wanted to do. I started using the elliptical that was gathering dust in my basement. I made a rule: I'm only allowed to watch Netflix while working out or moving in some other way (like washing dishes or folding laundry).\n\nThen a curious thing happened: The more I exercised, the more my body craved it. These days, I even take spin class and do high-intensity interval training.\n\nAnd while I did lose weight during this process (which was pretty nice \u2014 I am now at a healthy weight), that's not what's kept me going.\n\nFor me, exercise has become a bodily need. I just don't feel right without it. And while I used to think I didn't have time to work out, nowadays I don't see how I could get through my busy days without the energy I get from exercise. (And my insomnia is pretty much gone.)\n\nAs psychologist Michelle Segar notes, there are tons of documented mental benefits to exercise.\n\n\"We know that it helps people generate energy. We know that it boosts mood,\" she says. \"We know that it improves executive functioning and all the tasks associated with that \u2014 focus, creativity. There are so many positives that happen when you move.\"\n\nIn fact, even though lots of people start exercising this time of year to lose weight, Segar says for many people, weight loss isn't actually a good motivator over the long haul, because it can take way too long to see any results, and our brains are not wired to strive for long-term payoff. Weight is much more a factor of what we eat \u2014 and eating a 600-calorie muffin takes no time at all. Working it off, on the other hand, takes a good long time.\n\nGiven that reality, Segar says focusing on the immediate rewards from exercise can be more effective at keeping you motivated.\n\n\"When you have more energy and you're a happier person, you bring that much more enthusiasm and energy and performance to your role in your work, your patience as a parent, [and] as a partner to someone,\" she says.\n\n\"Feeling better isn't just this selfish, hedonic thing \u2014 it actually is fuel. I consider energy from taking care of yourself as essential fuel for the things that matter most in our lives.\"\n\nIf you've been sedentary, adding more movement into your day is a good place to start an exercise habit. Just grab that bottom rung. Remember, you have to start somewhere."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/15/105807270/bidding-farewell-to-hello-dolly-actress-carol-channing-dies-at-97", "text": "Bidding Farewell To 'Hello, Dolly!': Actress Carol Channing Dies At 97\n\nHide caption American actress and singer Carol Channing starred in the musical Hello, Dolly! in New York City in 1964.

She died Tuesday morning, her publicist told Broadway World. She was 97 years old.\n\nBorn in Seattle in 1921, Channing's parents were Christian Scientists. She recalls that she got her first glimpse of backstage delivering copies of The Christian Science Monitor to theaters.\n\nSome nights they're hyper, some nights they're slow, some nights they're sleepy, we have to nurse them; we have to find the way in to communicate with them. ... It's an electric thing for the performer; it's like plugging me in the wall.\n\n\"It came over me that I was looking at the stage and backstage of a cathedral, a temple, a mosque, a mother church,\" Channing wrote in her memoir Just Lucky, I Guess. \"I know I'm using adult words to describe a child's feelings, but I don't know how else to tell you this simple reaction of a child to a holy place.\"\n\nChanning's near-religious connection to her audience gave her an astounding amount of energy, and she grew irritated with those who tried to diminish the importance of theater in people's lives.\n\n\"Live theater is something that can't possibly die because we're working on their metabolism,\" said Channing. \"Some nights they're hyper, some nights they're slow, some nights they're sleepy, we have to nurse them; we have to find the way in to communicate with them. ...

But the role with which Channing will always be identified is Dolly.\n\nIt was this role in Hello, Dolly! that Channing loved most because it was life affirming in every sense.

After enduring more than three weeks of the ongoing partial government shutdown, hundreds of furloughed workers gathered in the Montgomery County, Md., high school to share a meal.\n\nThe potluck of hearty foods such as ravioli, pizza and chicken \u2014 whatever people in the community had to donate \u2014 fed well more than 600 workers who are feeling the financial strain of missing a paycheck.\n\nThere was plenty of dessert too.\n\nThe meal was especially sweet for many, considering the circumstances. Just outside of Washington, Montgomery County is home to at least 750,000 federal employees, so even those who aren't furloughed are feeling the ripple effect in the community.\n\nMontgomery County Council Member Tom Hucker decided to organize the potluck, called the Shutdown Social, to help furloughed workers get out of the house and get their minds off of the shutdown.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Dave Asche Courtesy of Dave Asche\n\nThat's exactly why Melinda Batson, who works at the Food and Drug Administration, decided to show up. Her last paycheck showed nothing but zeros.\n\n\"It does something mentally to you, to look at a paycheck and all you see is zeros,\" she said. \"It's nice to get out, but it's sad to see the faces of public service sitting down, taking a meal. For some people this might be their only meal.\"\n\nHucker was shocked at the event's turnout, which had only been announced the prior Monday. He said he realized that even for those with good jobs, missing three weeks of pay was heavily affecting people's lives.\n\n\"They are staying home every night, they haven't gone out to dinner, they're eating fish sticks in the bottom of the freezer,\" he said.\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Dave Asche\n\nStaying at home, unsure of when she can return to work and unable to go out and spend money, is making resident Roberta Long feel stir crazy. The youngest of her two sons, who is 4 years old, also is getting antsy.\n\nNormally he attends day care at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where Long works as an IT specialist. But the government shutdown doesn't just mean no work for Long \u2014 it also means no day care.\n\nSpending 24/7 with her spirited youngster is wearing her thin.\n\n\"It's been mad, it's just been like utter chaos,\" she said as her energetic son ran around the cafeteria.\n\nLooking at her son she added, \"That's not sugar, that's just life.\"\n\nHer son was having a blast, so she and her husband agreed it was good for him to get out of the house. In the background, lively drumming from local high school musicians kept the energy and spirits in the room high.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., made an appearance at the event after pushing legislation to give furloughed federal workers back pay, which passed in the Senate on Thursday and in the House on Friday. The bill guarantees that federal workers eventually will be paid for the time they were furloughed and is awaiting a White House signature.\n\n\"I was pleased ... to at least take the cloud of uncertainty away from federal employees and guarantee that when this shameful shutdown ends they will be paid in full, but what they really want to do is get back to work for the American people, so let's keep pushing,\" he said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Dave Asche Courtesy of Dave Asche\n\nOthers in the area who aren't directly impacted by the shutdown also came to show support. Dozens of volunteers and sponsors helped make the event happen, including 17 local restaurants donating food, and local firefighters who came in carrying boxes of pizza.\n\nLocal resident Marilyn Opitz said many others in the community are indirectly impacted \u2014 either they know someone who is currently furloughed, or their business is suffering as a result. The latter is the case for Opitz, who works as a hairstylist and makeup artist.\n\nShe said many furloughed workers are her clients, and now they're canceling appointments.\n\n\"It trickles down,\" she said, speaking about the shutdown's impact. \"If you live here long enough, you're going to be affected by it.\"\n\nOpitz watches the news every day to check for updates on the shutdown. So does Long. But Long is not feeling optimistic.\n\n\"I'm trying to make sense of it,\" she sighed. \"I feel like there's not even an end in sight.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/11/684324935/last-wwii-nazi-living-in-us-deported-to-germany-last-year-is-dead-at-95", "text": "Last Known WWII Nazi Living In U.S., Deported To Germany Last Year, Is Dead at 95\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Department of Justice via AP U.S. Department of Justice via AP\n\nA Nazi war criminal, living safely in the United States until his deportation to Germany last year, has died. He had been the last known World War II Nazi living in the U.S.\n\nJakiw Palij immigrated to America in 1949, claiming he had worked on his father's farm during World War II. But a Justice Department investigation, based on evidence compiled by a senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, found that Palij served as an armed guard of civilian prisoners at a forced-labor camp for Jews at the Trawniki camp in Nazi Germany-occupied Poland. That's where Nazi SS troops were trained to kill Polish Jews.\n\nA federal judge stripped Jakiw Palij of his citizenship in 2003, finding that he had lied when he came to the U.S. He was ordered deported in 2004, but no country would take him until Germany finally relented last year. This week, at the age of 95, Palij died. He was never charged for his involvement in the Holocaust.\n\n\"An evil man has passed away,\" Rabbi Zev Meir Friedman told The Associated Press. \"That, I guess, is a positive.\" Friedman had led multiple student protests in front of Palij's home in the Queens borough of New York City.\n\nIt had looked as though the aging Palij would die in the U.S., CNN reported in 2016. But there was continued lawmaker interest in deporting the war criminal. A bipartisan group of New York's congressional delegation wrote to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017, urging him to make the matter a priority. Palij's continued residence in New York was a \"painful reminder for Americans who fought against the Nazis or lost loved ones in the Holocaust,\" said the letter, signed by 21 members of Congress. \"We are deeply concerned that the deportation of Mr. Palij is stalled and urge your personal intervention on the matter.\"\n\nPresident Trump told Fox News last year he made the deportation of Palij a priority after many presidents had not. \"From the beginning of the campaign, they tell me about this Nazi who lived in Queens, who walks the street like he owns the place,\" Trump said.\n\n\"The Obama administration was unable to pull it off,\" Trump said of the deportation. \"And, frankly, the Bush administration was unable to pull it off. And I was able to pull it off.\"\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said he had raised the question of Palij's deportation in every meeting with German officials, based in part on the urging of the president, NPR reported. With a new government installed in Berlin, there was \"new energy\" for negotiations, he said. Germany agreed to accept Palij in August. That month, federal immigration agents carried Palij out of his home on a stretcher, into an ambulance and onto a plane.\n\n\"Palij's removal sends a strong message: The United States will not tolerate those who facilitated Nazi crimes and other human rights violations, and they will not find a safe haven on American soil,\" press secretary Sarah Sanders said in August.\n\nMore than 70 years since the war ended, the pain of Nazi atrocities still reverberates around the globe. On Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel apologized to Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos for the damage inflicted on Greece by Hitler's forces. \"We are aware of our historical responsibility,\" said Merkel. \"We know how much suffering Germany caused Greece during the era of National Socialism.\"\n\nBut German authorities never charged Palij for his involvement in the atrocities of Trawniki. Jens Rommel, the head of the Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, told reporters that there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute him. \"There is no investigation into him in Germany, which means there is no arrest warrant, and as a result, it is not very likely that he will ever be convicted,\" Rommel told the broadcaster Deutsche Welle last year.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kathy Willens/AP Kathy Willens/AP\n\n\"The difficulty lies not so much in describing the murders, the individual massacres, the functions of those at a camp, but in determining the individual's responsibility,\" Rommel said. \"By what action, by carrying out what duty, by what function did the individual facilitate this murder? That is what we have to prove. And with mobile units, which some of these Trawniki men were in, that's extremely difficult.\"\n\nNew York lawmaker Dov Hikind, who had fought for the deportation, told the AP that Palij's death brings \"the closure survivors of the Holocaust needed.\"\n\nGerman prosecutors have intensified their hunt for the last remaining Nazis before they die of old age, USA Today reported last year. Nazi hunters estimated that dozens of Nazis could still be alive."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/13/684926057/winter-storm-reaches-mid-atlantic-after-killing-5-in-the-midwest", "text": "Deadly Winter Storm Reaches Mid-Atlantic After Hitting The Midwest\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jason Hanna/Getty Images Jason Hanna/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 7:00 p.m. ET\n\nPower outages, cancelled flights and hazardous driving conditions continue to plague the Midwest and East Coast as a winter storm sweeps across the country, dumping more than a foot of snow in some areas and causing at least seven traffic fatalities.\n\nThe storm traveled from the Rockies to pummel the Midwest on Friday and Saturday, before reaching Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia, which has declared a state of emergency.

Both Greece and its northern neighbor consider Alexander, and the name, integral parts of their identity, Kakissis reports.\n\nPrevious Greek governments have also claimed the tiny Republic of Macedonia might use the name to make territorial claims on its province.\n\nThe disagreement has sparked protests on both sides of the territorial boundary and produced real consequences: Greece has blocked Macedonia's entry into both NATO and the European Union.

The first one came just over 40 years ago, 200 years after the country's founding. But since that time, the fisticuffs of divided government and spending disputes have become fairly commonplace \u2014 if not usually this lengthy.\n\nFirst shutdown was in 1976\n\nThe first partial shutdown came under President Gerald Ford in 1976 when he vetoed a spending bill amid a dispute over the budget for the Department of Health, Education & Welfare (a department that no longer exists in that form or under that name).\n\nA whole slew of them followed over the next two decades. There were five during Jimmy Carter's four years in office, and eight between 1981 and 1989 during Ronald Reagan's administration.\n\nBut the finger-pointing then \u2014 and the rhetoric \u2014 can feel quite familiar to today. In 1984, President Reagan laid the blame on what he saw as intransigent House Democrats.\n\n\"This has been typical of what has been happening since we've been here,\" he said, \"and you can lay this on the majority party in the House of Representatives.\"\n\nEarly shutdowns had familiar rhetoric but unfamiliar priorities\n\nThere are some big differences between those early government shutdowns and what's seen today.\n\n\"They tended to revolve around basically bargaining over routine government activities,\" said Duke University political scientist David Rohde.\n\nThere would be a budget negotiation and maybe a fight over some item large or small \u2014 perhaps funding for a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (1978) or the MX missile (1982).\n\nThe deadline would pass; the government would partially shut down; but the two sides would continue negotiating, confident that they would find some quick compromise that would get everything up and operating again.\n\n\"There was a lot less political heat,\" Rohde said, \"and a lot less attention paid by the general public.\"\n\nThen came the 1990s\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Denis Paquin/AP Denis Paquin/AP\n\nIn fall and winter of 1995 and 1996, Clinton was president and Republicans had control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Gingrich wanted deep budget cuts after Republicans took back the House in 1994 with their \"Contract with America.\"\n\nGingrich felt he had a mandate to enact strictures on big government. His \"contract\" promised to make government spend less and laid out galvanizing principles for his followers in Congress that also laid the foundation for the Tea Party two decades later \u2014 and the modern Republican Party.\n\nPresident Clinton, a Southern Democrat, said he was committed to a balanced budget. But the two sides couldn't agree on which long-term budget projections to use \u2014 the White House wanted to use data from its Office of Management and Budget, while Republicans wanted the Congressional Budget Office's. The CBO had a less optimistic view of revenue that would be coming in, thus requiring deeper spending cuts.\n\nClinton accused the GOP of having \"failed to pass the straightforward legislation necessary to keep the government running without imposing sharp hikes in Medicare premiums and deep cuts in education and the environment.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nGingrich responded: \"We think all the president has to do is commit to a seven-year balanced budget with honest numbers and an honest scoring system.\"\n\nThe language was bureaucratic, but it represented a huge change in how such negotiations were conducted. The dispute wasn't simply a matter of haggling over a specific department budget or a single line item; it was about ideology, getting to the very core of how big the federal government should be and how it should operate.\n\nThe first shutdown that session was five days, followed by a 21-day impasse that had stood until now as the longest government shutdown ever.\n\nNo easy resolution\n\nToday's shutdown continues without a clear way out, short of the president declaring a national emergency at the Southern border and signing spending bills.\n\nThere was no quick and easy solution to the dispute in 1995-96, either. Each side was certain that the public would back them. As it turned out, Gingrich and the GOP lost that particular bet. Polls at the time showed that the public put the blame on the House speaker and his party and that they wanted the government operating again.\n\nCracks formed in the Republican solidarity, and in a session of Congress held on New Year's Eve, Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas signaled that the fight was over for his fellow Republicans.\n\n\"We ought to end this,\" Dole said on the Senate floor. \"I mean, it's gotten to the point where it's a little ridiculous as far as this senator is concerned.\"\n\nAssociated Press YouTube\n\nThe government reopened days later. It was widely seen as a setback for the GOP, and the shutdown of 1995-96 became known as a cautionary tale for years to come.\n\nTwo decades without a shutdown \u2014 for a reason\n\nAfter the political pain that was felt in the mid-1990s over that shutdown, there wasn't another one until 2013, when Republicans used budget negotiations to try to defund the Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare.\"\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThe shutdown did last 16 days, but, as was the case some 18 years earlier, Republicans failed to win the big prize they had targeted that year.\n\nDemocrats had their own government shutdown defeat early last year. They did so in an effort to force passage of legislation aimed at giving legal immigration status to those granted special DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, status, which includes the so-called DREAMers.\n\nIt was a miscalculation, and Democrats backed down quickly when poll numbers were shifting against them.\n\nFast forward to today's shutdown, driven by Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the Southern border with Mexico. Rohde said it's a lot like in 1995, in that it's not a mere budget fight.\n\nBut this impasse is especially difficult because of one major factor.\n\n\"Trump's calculation politically is not about the center of the electorate,\" Rhode said. \"That's the difference.\"\n\nThe president has said he's worried about losing his hardcore base of supporters. They are anything but the kind of centrist swing voters whose opinion can give one side or another the upper hand in such negotiations.\n\nBut Trump sees them as his key to victory, and he's pushing Republicans who disagree that they need to get on board as well. Small cracks have begun to show among Republicans in Congress, but it's not a gusher.\n\nAnd all of that makes finding a resolution especially difficult."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/684145551/in-mexico-reynosa-has-become-an-unintended-home-for-a-growing-number-of-migrants", "text": "In Mexico, Reynosa Has Become An Unintended Home For A Growing Number Of Migrants\n\nHundreds of migrants deported to Mexico are sent back through the Reynosa border crossing.

McAllen is one of the safest cities in the U.S. Across the border, however, sits one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico - Reynosa. It's become an unintended home for a growing number of migrants. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports.\n\nCARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Josue Edgardo Baquedano arrived here in Reynosa two months ago with his 5-year-old son. They fled the violent city of San Pedro Sula in Honduras, where he says it's nearly impossible to keep your children out of the gangs. \"They steal them from you or lure them away with fancy shoes and cellphones,\" he says.\n\nJOSUE EDGARDO BAQUEDANO: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nKAHN: \"And then they tell you, you have a problem because your child isn't yours anymore.

And within a few minutes, Mexican immigration officials arrived and took him and his son away. They were detained for three days but luckily not deported back to Honduras. He says he's since found a job and a house and is staying put for now. Baquedano is lucky. Officials here say many migrants stuck in the city fall prey to the criminal groups that dominate this northern Mexican border city.\n\nReynosa's mayor, Maki Ortiz Dominguez, says it's not just U.S.-bound migrants that are concentrating in the city. She's dealing with thousands of migrants deported from the U.S. as well. She says 150 to 180 each day are deported to the region.\n\nMAKI ESTHER ORTIZ DOMINGUEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nKAHN: \"The fact that there is such a concentrated number of migrants in cities along the border could give rise to another type of organized crime,\" she says. She's worried about gangs easily recruiting desperate migrants. And she says her police force is already stretched thin. I caught her outside a hotel ballroom before she went into a celebration for National Police Day, which included a full breakfast for all the cops in town and raffle prizes. A local commander walked away with a new refrigerator.\n\nORTIZ DOMINGUEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nKAHN: \"I'm so proud of all of you,\" Ortiz Dominguez told the crowd. And she's tried to increase their salaries and give them the best tools they need to do their jobs, but it's tough. Reynosa has some of the most lucrative drug routes into the U.S. Two cartels battle for the region. Last year, more than 250 people were murdered here, thousands more went missing. And mixed in with all that violence are the migrants, says Mariana Calderon, a psychologist with the state's institute to assist migrants.\n\nMARIANA CALDERON: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nKAHN: \"Reynosa's one of the places with the highest number of kidnappings, extortions and murders,\" she says. Migrants are a big target to those criminals. Josue Edgardo Baquedano, the migrant from Honduras who's stuck in Reynosa for now, says he doesn't think President Trump's wall will keep migrants out of the U.S. He says, people crave a safe place to live.\n\nBAQUEDANO: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nKAHN: \"You can build a wall 30 feet high with a line of snakes below it, but people's needs are much greater,\" he says, \"they'll get around it.\" Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Reynosa, Mexico.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: We mistranslate a comment by Josue Edgardo Baquedano.

Kelly's debut solo album landed in the Billboard 200 \u2014 and less than six months after Kelly produced Aaliyah's debut album, Age Ain't Nothing But A Number.\n\nThat title would prove apt: As the magazine Vibe reveals just months later, the official Illinois wedding certificate falsified Aaliyah's age, listing Kelly's young prot\u00e9g\u00e9e as 18. (Demetrius Smith, a former tour manager and personal assistant to R. Kelly, later told the Surviving R. Kelly team that he had documents forged for the two and that Aaliyah appeared to be scared at the ceremony.)\n\nWithin months, the marriage is annulled, but it remains a subject of frequent questions \u2014 both for Aaliyah, who dies in a plane crash in 2001, and for Kelly, who has described their relationship as \"deep friends\" but has avoided commenting further.\n\n\"Well, because of Aaliyah's passing, as I've always said, out of respect for her mother who's sick and her father who's passed, I will never have that conversation with anyone. Out of respect for Aaliyah, and her mother and father who has asked me not to personally,\" he told GQ in 2016. \"But I can tell you I loved her, I can tell you she loved me, we was very close.\"\n\nReturn to the start or keep scrolling.\n\nDec. 21, 2000\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Winter/ImageDirect/Getty Images Kevin Winter/ImageDirect/Getty Images\n\nChicago Sun-Times prints the first allegations of sex with minors\n\nThe singer is about to turn 34 when Chicago Sun-Times reporters Jim DeRogatis and Abdon M. Pallasch publish a story alleging that Kelly is using his fame to meet girls as young as 15 years old and then coerce them into having sex with him. At least two of those girls say that they met him at Kenwood Academy, a public high school on Chicago's South Side that Kelly had attended before dropping out and where he is alleged to have returned again and again to pick up young women.\n\nAccording to the Sun-Times, by this point Chicago police have investigated Kelly twice on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl but dropped the investigations because the girl wouldn't cooperate. The article also notes, \"Kelly is hardly the first celebrity to be accused of taking advantage of underage girls. Gary Glitter, Rob Lowe, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roman Polanski, Rolling Stone Bill Wyman and even the legendary Errol Flynn all have been written about in this paper and others for allegedly having trysts with minors.\"\n\nThe Sun-Times report is published within weeks of Kelly \u2014 who has already sold more than 20 million albums \u2014 releasing his fifth album, TP-2.com, which goes to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart.\n\nReturn to the start or keep scrolling.\n\nFeb. 8, 2002\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images\n\nChicago police reveal investigation into alleged child pornography\n\nDraped in a star-spangled robe and surrounded by tens of thousands of screaming fans, R.

(Despite the alleged age of the girl in the video, Kelly would not be charged with statutory rape.)\n\nKelly quickly and vehemently denies that it is him in the video, which appears to show him with a girl who would have been in her early teens at the time of the filming. The video had been sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times, which had published child sex allegations against the singer nearly two years earlier.\n\n\"It's crap, and that's how we're going to treat it,\" Kelly says in an interview held with a local TV station before his Olympic performance.\n\nReturn to the start or keep scrolling.\n\nJune 5, 2002\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption George McGinn/Getty Images George McGinn/Getty Images\n\nKelly indicted on 21 counts of child pornography\n\nJust four months after the police probe is revealed, R. Kelly finds himself in handcuffs outside his holiday home in Florida.\n\nA grand jury in Cook County, Ill., has indicted Kelly on 21 counts of child pornography related to the videotape. The charges include seven counts each of directing the taping, producing the video and enticing the underage girl into performing illicit acts.\n\n\"Sexual predators are a scourge on society,\" Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine says in a statement released on June 5. \"This indictment should send a clear message that illicit acts with minor children will not be tolerated in the community.\"\n\nOne day later, Kelly is formally charged in a Florida courtroom.\n\nThat state would also charge Kelly with an additional 12 counts of creating child pornography, alleging that during his arrest, police found a camera with new images showing sex with an underage girl. Those charges would be dropped after a judge found that the camera was improperly seized. Seven of the original 21 charges in Chicago would also eventually be dropped in 2004, after prosecutors acknowledged that those counts pertained to a law that wasn't passed until after the alleged taping.\n\nReturn to the start or keep scrolling.\n\nMay 9, 2008\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption L.D.

During this stretch, he continues headlining tour stops and recording new music \u2014 even snagging six Grammy nominations. More than half a decade passes before his trial begins.\n\n\"The case has dragged on for seemingly bizarre reasons,\" Time magazine reporter Steven Gray explained to NPR in 2008. \"Just last December, R. Kelly failed to make a scheduled court appearance because his tour bus was stopped speeding by Utah authorities and he couldn't make it to court the next day. One time, Judge Gaughan, the presiding judge, he fell off a ladder and hurt himself so he was out for a while. Another time ... one of the prosecutors had a baby, so that also caused them postponement.\"\n\nThe trial begins in late spring.

The family never went to the police, and there was an aunt who was a police officer. They went to a lawyer for money,' \" WBEZ's Natalie Moore recounts after closing arguments.\n\nThe jury spends less than a day in deliberation before returning its verdict: not guilty. Kelly walks out of the Chicago courtroom a free man, sliding silently into his car as supporters cheer around him.

She filed for a restraining order in 2005 and alleges that he hit her when she asked for a divorce. She also says that she considered suicide.\n\nAccording to Andrea Kelly, she and the singer were already living apart by the time he stood trial in Chicago. She tells The View that her impetus to come forward publicly was hearing another woman make allegations on another show \u2014 explaining that the woman seemed to be speaking about her ex-husband without using his name, as the accusations seemed to mirror her own history with Kelly: \"Some of the specific things she described in detail, I had been through, I mean, verbatim.\" (Andrea Kelly also appears in Surviving R.

Kelly on multiple occasions in recent years, despite the common knowledge of the accusations against the singer. After the series begins airing, Chance elaborates on Twitter: \"The truth is any of us who ever ignored the R Kelly stories, or ever believed he was being setup/attacked by the system (as black men often are) were doing so at the detriment of black women and girls.

Kelly.\n\nAlso this week, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that at least two women have contacted Foxx's office with complaints regarding Kelly since she made her appeal. Pop star Lady Gaga publicly apologizes via Twitter for having made a 2013 duet with R. Kelly called \"Do What U Want\" (the chorus goes, \"Do what you want with my body\").\n\n\"I stand behind these women [in the docuseries] 1000% percent,\" she writes, adding: \"I think it's clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time.\"\n\nOn Jan. 10, Kelly's estranged daughter, Buku Abi (whose birth name is Joann Kelly), posts a lengthy note to her Instagram stories responding to the docuseries \u2014 a note in which she calls her father a \"monster.\"\n\n\"Going through all I have gone through in my life, I would never want anyone to feel the pain I have felt,\" she writes. \"The same monster you all [are] confronting me about is my father.

I'm sickened as a prosecutor.\" (Additionally, there are unconfirmed reports that Fulton County, Georgia, is opening its own investigation.)\n\nOn Jan. 14, alleged victim Faith Rodgers appears at a press conference in New York City, saying that Kelly threatened to retaliate against her after she filed a civil suit against him in the New York Supreme Court. Those threatened retaliations, according to Rodgers, included him sharing private photos of her and saying that he would bring forward 10 male witnesses to testify \"about her sex life.\"\n\nDistributed by Gloria Allred\n\nAttorney Lydia Hills, who represents Rodgers, says at the press conference that attached to a notarized and signed letter Kelly sent to her in response to the suit were several photos of Rodgers and text that \"indicated that if Ms. Rodgers proceeded with the lawsuit, these photos would be made public.\"\n\nRodgers is also represented by attorney Gloria Allred, who, in turn, works for two other women who allege that they were victims of Kelly \u2014 one of whom was underage at the time of the alleged abuse. Allred adds that on Jan. 14, Rodgers will be speaking with the New York Police Department, which, the lawyer says, is conducting an investigation into the singer.\n\nOn Jan. 18, NBC News announces that it will be airing an interview that evening with one of Kelly's accusers, a woman named Tracy Sampson, who says that Kelly began abusing her in 1999, when she was 16 years old and an intern at Epic Records, a label that, like RCA, is a subsidiary of Sony.\n\nSampson has come forward previously with her allegations; in a May 2018 interview with the Washington Post, she said that she filed a lawsuit against Kelly in 2002 and that it was settled for $250,000. According to the Post, Sampson tried to cultivate a career afterward in artist management, but, the newspaper wrote, she \"gave up because she was told her dispute with Kelly had poisoned her reputation.\"\n\nSpeaking to NBC, an attorney for Kelly, Steven Greenberg, denies any wrongdoing with Sampson or any other women.\n\nOn Feb. 21, two more women \u2014 both also represented by Allred \u2014 come forward with claims that Kelly made sexual advances on them when they were underage, back in the mid-1990s.

He is expected back in court on child-support related matters on March 13.\n\nThe arrest comes just hours after CBS' This Morning airs clips of his first interview since the 10-count indictment was announced. In the interview, Kelly tells co-host Gayle King that he is innocent, and that his accusers are making up their claims for their own gain.\n\n\"I'm very tired of all of the lies,\" he says. \"I've been hearing things, and you know, and seeing things on the blogs, and you know \u2014 you know, I'm just tired.\"\n\nKelly denies the crimes attributed to him and pushes back against the allegations laid out in Surviving R. Kelly: \"They was describing Lucifer. I'm not Lucifer. I'm a man. I make mistakes, but I'm not a devil, and by no means am I a monster.\"\n\nHe accuses his own accusers of seeking to profit from the allegations. And at times during the emotional conversation, Kelly breaks into tears, even standing and shouting his vehement defense at the camera until the show paused filming.\n\n\"Thirty years of my career! And y'all trying to kill me? You're killing me, man!\" he says, slamming his fist in his palm before people on set calm him down. \"This is not about music!

And we won't stop until we have our answers and make sure your well-being is OK, and that you're safe and sound.\"\n\nOn Thursday, CBS This Morning airs more of the King interview. In this footage, Kelly denies that he has ever paid out any settlements to any women, despite court documents indicating that he has paid money to three women who say they had sex with him as minors.\n\nHe also again denies abuse allegations made by his ex-wife, Andrea Kelly, and screams and weeps when King asked him about the outstanding child-support payments. He shouts: \"How can I pay child support \u2014 how \u2014 if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work? ... What kind of woman would tear down a dad who's trying to have a relationship with their kids?\" He admits to King, however, that he has \"zero\" contact with their three children.\n\nHe also asserts to King, \"So many people have been stealing my money,\" but also tells King that he had not stepped foot in a bank by himself until about three to four weeks ago, and that he does not understand where his money or royalties have gone.\n\nThe Thursday broadcast also includes further footage interviews with Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary, who are both currently living with Kelly. The women say that they have not been brainwashed, that they are happy and that they are both in love with him.\n\nAn angry Clary makes her own stunning claim against her parents, saying that they encouraged her to make sexual videos with Kelly when she was just 17, in order to blackmail the singer at some future point, and says that her parents had specifically asked for $30,000 from Kelly.\n\nSavage adds: \"Our parents are basically just out here trying to get money and scam.\"\n\nReturn to the start or keep scrolling.\n\nMarch 9-10, 2019\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Derek Henkle/AFP/Getty Images Derek Henkle/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKelly is freed from jail again; Gloria Allred alleges existence of another tape\n\nOn March 9, Kelly is released from prison in Illinois.

Especially if you're a young neurotic extroverted guy who drives a lot.\n\nTwo seconds of attention to the insistent beeping and blinking of our mobile phones or simply changing the radio station accounts for at least 12 percent of car accidents worldwide and 14 percent of them in the U.S., according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nWhile anyone can get distracted behind the wheel, some people may be more prone than others, according to a study published Friday in Frontiers in Psychology by Ole Johansson, a researcher at Norway's Institute of Transport Economics.\n\nThe study looks at the driving habits and personalities of hundreds of Norwegian high schoolers and adults. While few reported distracted driving was a problem for them, some patterns about who was more likely to be distracted emerged.\n\nYoung men were among the most likely to report distraction due to phones but also people talking in the car or flipping through the radio dial. The study found that the more distraction-prone included frequent drivers, and those with neurotic and extroverted personalities.\n\nAlso, people who felt that distracted driving was socially acceptable or didn't feel they could control distractions were also more likely to report distracted driving, the study shows. Older women and those who felt that they could control their behavior were less likely to report distraction.\n\nThe study also looked at potential interventions, such as giving drivers a quiz of sorts, asking them \"If/Then\" questions designed to make them think about distracted driving. For example, \"If I find myself wondering whether someone has sent me a text, then I will __\" (remind myself it's against the law, remember it's dangerous to do so, etc.) However, this particular intervention did not cause a big dip in distracted driving.\n\nStill, the Norwegian study is the first of its kind to look at the connections between intentions and behavior when it comes to distracted driving, and it adds to emerging data on the impact of personalities and gender.\n\nBut it's very preliminary, says Ken Kolosh, manager of the statistics group at the U.S. National Safety Council. The NSC advocates for avoiding deaths and unintentional injuries in the workplace and on the road.\n\nThe main shortcoming of the Norwegian study is that it relies on self-reporting.\n\n\"It's very difficult for human beings to be so aware of themselves and to respond to questions on behavior,\" Kolosh says. And while people frequently report seeing others driving while using cell phones, they tend to underestimate how often they themselves are driving distracted.\n\nAlso, Norwegian drivers may act differently than drivers in other parts of the world, so it might be difficult to extrapolate the behavioral data.\n\nWhile technology can help curb distracted driving, such as phones that block data while driving, it's not always a plus, Kolosh says. And just because there's a new technology, say an infotainment screen in a car, that doesn't mean it's safe.\n\n\"The world of distraction is evolving really quickly,\" Kolosh says. The NSC was the first organization to call for a ban on talking on cell phones while driving 10 years ago, At the time, Kolosh says, \"We felt texting was so obviously dangerous, not many people will do it.\"\n\nUse of phones is not always recorded as a factor in car crashes, which means its likely underreported.\n\nFifteen states have bans on talking on a handheld phone while driving, 47 have texting bans, there are a slew of conflicting local regulations as well. Its hard to tell whether people are texting, talking, or looking up directions on their phones, Kolosh points out.\n\n\"We need to have stronger, simpler laws for law enforcement ... that's far more likely to help quickly improve conditions,\" he says.\n\nBut enforcement efforts can face social backlash, and people continue to drive distracted, Ole Johansson, a researcher at Norway's Institute of Transport Economics and lead author of the study, said in an email.\n\nThus it'simportant to identify who is likely to become distracted and develop ways to reduce those impulses, Johasson adds.\n\nIt's not just cell phones that are drawing our eyes away from the road. Sometimes its just someone talking inside the car. \"Distracting factors are closely related to attention,\" the study says. \"As the task of driving a vehicle is mostly taxing on the systems of visual attention, any factor that draws the gaze away from the road for a significant period of time could be classified as a distractor.\"\n\nApril Fulton is an editor on NPR's science desk.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that fatalities went up by 10.4 percent. Of course, that means thousands of lives. We're joined now by Mark Rosekind, who is the administrator of the NHTSA. Thanks very much for being with us.\n\nMARK ROSEKIND: It's my pleasure.\n\nSIMON: Why the increase, do you think?\n\nROSEKIND: That's always the first question that everybody asks. And we first saw in 2015 the largest increase, 7.2 percent, the largest percent increase in 50 years. So what we do know so far is, at least in 2015, the increase we saw was partly due to some things like high number of vehicle miles traveled. The economy was better. Gas prices are low. More people are working. That might account for about half of what we've seen.\n\nThe other half is mostly us as humans, choices or errors we make. So it's impairment, it's speeding, it's not wearing your seatbelt, drunk driving, drowsy driving. Those things remain the same old problems we've been dealing with for a long time.\n\nSIMON: What about distracted driving? Aren't there a lot more gizmos in the car?\n\nROSEKIND: Absolutely, and we know distraction is very significant.

So...\n\nSIMON: That's overwhelming, obviously.\n\nROSEKIND: Yes. And, you know, everybody's focused on defects and recalls, the Takata airbag recall, which has 70 million vehicles, you know? But it ends up only 2 percent of crashes are related to those kinds of defects. Ninety-four percent are the kind of choices we make that are creating these crashes.\n\nSIMON: Mr. Rosekind, I'm told you lost your father to a traffic fatality.\n\nROSEKIND: That's correct.

He was actually chasing a traffic violator and somebody ran a red light and hit him, killed instantly.\n\nSIMON: I'm very sorry.\n\nROSEKIND: Thank you. I was 3 and a half. My brother was 2. And though I've lived with that my whole life, actually being in this position, I've probably talked more about it than I ever have in my life because it means I understand personally what this kind of tragedy means when people lose loved ones.\n\nSIMON: Mark Rosekind of the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration.

All 50 states have laws that allow revocation of a driver's license for such a refusal. But a dozen states and the federal government have additional laws that provide criminal punishment \u2014 jail terms \u2014 for such refusals.\n\nThe states concede that breath tests and blood draws each constitute a \"search\" of a person's body and normally, under the Constitution, a search requires a warrant. But the question before the court was whether states can get around the warrant requirement by enacting laws that making it a crime to refuse to submit to a test.\n\nThree defendants from North Dakota and Minnesota are challenging their convictions for refusing to take either a blood alcohol or breath test. Their lawyer, Charles Rothfeld, told the justices that the fundamental problem with the statutes at issue here is that they make it a crime to assert a constitutional right \u2014 namely, the right to be free from a bodily search unless the police get a warrant.\n\nOne way to look at it, Justice Samuel Alito said, is that the defendants are \"reneging on a bargain.\" The bargain is: We give you a license to drive, and in exchange, you agree to take a blood alcohol test.\n\nRothfeld rejected that idea, noting that the defendants here had no idea they had ever consented to that bargain.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer suggested that breath tests are different from blood alcohol tests: There is no bodily intrusion except for the insertion of a straw into the mouth to breathe into; there is no pain; and it can be done roadside.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan asked why the court should not deem a breath test as necessary to measure evidence of quickly dissipating alcohol in the blood.\n\nBut if all that sounds as though the court was friendly to the idea of warrantless blood alcohol and breath tests, the worm turned quickly when the lawyers for the states and the federal government began to present their arguments.\n\nLawyer Thomas McCarthy, representing North Dakota, tried to tell the justices that they would be putting the states \"in a terrible bind\" if search warrants were to become required for these tests.\n\nJustices, both liberal and conservative, pounced.\n\n\"In Wyoming it takes five minutes\" to get a warrant, we are told, said Justice Breyer, and in Montana, 15.\n\nJustice Kagan added that \"over 40\" states have set up electronic systems for getting warrants.\n\nBut McCarthy maintained that in rural North Dakota it would take a half-hour to an hour to get a warrant.\n\n\"Why is it harder to get somebody on the phone\" in a rural area than in a busy city, asked Justice Anthony Kennedy, adding puckishly that you would \"think people in the rural areas were sitting waiting for the phone\" to ring.\n\nRural areas have fewer resources, replied McCarthy, and fewer people to process warrant requests.\n\n\"So that excuses you from a constitutional requirement?\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. \"We're now going to bend the Fourth Amendment [to] give a pass to North Dakota?\"\n\nAs the justices pressed for \"practical\" explanations from the states, Justice Kagan asked what the justification is for not getting a warrant if other similar states can get one in 10 or 15 minutes.\n\n\"You're asking for an extraordinary exception here,\" Justice Kennedy said, \"and you're just not answering the question.\"\n\nLawyer Kathryn Keena, representing Minnesota, didn't have any more luck with her argument, though she tried to persuade the justices that they were blind to the facts of life in rural Minnesota and North Dakota, while she, who had grown up in \"a town of 2,000, 20 miles from the North Dakota border,\" could tell them a thing or two.\n\nHer argument suffered even more when the federal government's Ian Gershengorn, while arguing against a warrant requirement, made a contradictory point. It is urban areas that have trouble meeting the warrant requirement, he maintained, because a city like New York is so busy that its courts may have time for terrorism warrants, but not warrants to get a blood alcohol test.\n\nIn rebuttal, however, lawyer Rothfeld countered that studies conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that routine warrant procedures \u2014 in rural and urban areas alike \u2014 drive down test refusals, and drive up DUI convictions."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/12/23/372729203/number-of-cars-earning-top-safety-awards-nearly-doubles", "text": "Number Of Cars Earning Top Safety Awards Nearly Doubles\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Thayer/Getty Images Eric Thayer/Getty Images\n\nIf you're looking for a new car or SUV, it should be easier to find a safe one from the current models: The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says the number of vehicles winning its two safety awards jumped from 39 to 71 for the 2015 model year.\n\nThe rise came despite tougher standards for current models to earn the IIHS's best ratings.\n\nThe winners range from the Chevrolet Spark and Volvo S60 to the Honda Odyssey.

U.S. officials confirmed to NPR that they had been aware of the threat but could not say how far the plot had progressed and whether revealing it publicly now makes it less likely.\n\nThe plot, the U.K. newspaper reports and U.S. officials confirm, is thought to involve the smuggling of bombs onto planes bound for major cities in Europe. The plan did not seem to include any U.S.-bound flights, U.S. officials told NPR.\n\nIn response, counterterrorism officials on both sides of the Atlantic have been discussing how to prevent the attacks. One remedy under consideration is to ban all carry-on baggage, though there is some question as to whether airlines would push back against such a draconian provision.\n\nAnother possible remedy: banning electronic devices from the passenger cabin. Officials are discussing whether to require that electronics such as cellphones, iPads and computers be placed in the cargo hold with checked baggage, which goes through a much more rigorous screening process. Detecting a bomb, if there is one, would be more likely.\n\nU.S. officials have been warning for some time about what they call the \"next-generation explosives\" developed by al-Qaida. Last year, the head of the Transportation Security Administration, John Pistole, described an explosive that looked like toothpaste or bathroom caulk but could be used to bring down a commercial aircraft.\n\nThe possibility of getting something like that aboard a flight is more likely now, officials say, because of the literally thousands of people with European passports who have joined forces with Islamist extremists in Syria who might be persuaded to be part of a terrorist attack.\n\nMany of those people have joined rebel groups in Syria or the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, which is at odds with al-Qaida's central leadership. The problem is that intelligence in Syria is patchy at best, and counterterrorism officials don't know how many of the individuals who travel to Syria to fight have, in the meantime, joined forces with a group affiliated with al-Qaida.\n\nJust last month, a 24-year-old Frenchman named David Drugeon was killed by a cruise missile in Syria. He is thought to have received some training from Ibrahim al-Asiri, al-Qaida's master bomb-maker. Asiri has specialized in developing bombs with nonmetallic explosive devices that can be concealed in electronics. He successfully smuggled a bomb onto a cargo plane bound for the U.S. in 2010. He had disguised the bomb to look like toner in a computer printer cartridge."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/11/24/366423486/honda-says-it-failed-to-report-over-1-700-deaths-and-injuries", "text": "Honda Says It Failed To Report Over 1,700 Deaths And Injuries\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Koji Sasahara/AP Koji Sasahara/AP\n\nHonda Motor Co. said today that for years it failed to tell U.S. regulators about more than 1,700 injuries and deaths involving its cars. In an online statement on the issue, the company says it failed to properly report from 2003 to 2014, for a total of 1,729 \"written claims or notices concerning injuries or deaths.\" Honda also admits that it underreported property damage claims and warranty claims.\n\nHonda says there was a delay between when it found out about the underreporting and when it started to fully investigate the issue. A \"Honda associate\" first noticed the issue in 2011, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration raised the issue with Honda in 2012, but a third-party audit didn't begin until September of this year.\n\nHonda is blaming the failure on an error in its databases that caused reports entered without a date to be omitted. The company also says coding errors contributed to the problem, as well as an \"overly narrow\" definition of \"written notice.\" Under a law called the TREAD Act, car companies have to report to the government any claims they receive alleging defective vehicles or parts that cause death or injury.\n\nBloomberg reports that Honda could face a fine of up to $35 million as a result of the underreporting, one of the biggest in history.\n\nHonda has already been hurt by its association with Takata, the Japanese supplier under numerous investigations for defective airbags that could send metal shards flying when deployed.

The NHTSA told Bloomberg News in a statement that it is continuing with an \"ongoing investigation\" into the issue."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/10/03/353498827/al-qaida-reasserts-itself-with-khorasan-group", "text": "Al-Qaida Reasserts Itself With Khorasan Group\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Fadi al-Halabi/AFP/Getty Images Fadi al-Halabi/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the first targets of U.S. airstrikes in Syria was an al-Qaida unit that American officials call the Khorasan Group. Because few outside the intelligence community had ever heard of it, some critics have said Khorasan was created out of whole cloth to give the U.S. an excuse to bomb Syria.\n\nThey aren't alone: Rebel fighters on the ground say they have never heard of Khorasan. Others claim it's just another name for what's been known for years as Core al-Qaida, the branch of the terrorist group led by Ayman al-Zawahiri that Obama administration officials have claimed the U.S. decimated years ago.\n\n\"We've been watching this group for a long time,\" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a news conference this week. \"I can't account for the fact that it wasn't a household name in America or elsewhere around the world. The notion that we would just, you know, make them up or fancify the threat that they posed, you know, to justify a military action is just absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nIn fact, two intelligence officials told NPR that the U.S. military's Joint Special Operations Command felt Khorasan was a serious enough threat to put together a target list in June. The list included some of the group's leaders who were embedded \u2014 one U.S. official familiar with the intelligence used the word \"nested\" \u2014 with members of al-Qaida's arm in Syria, a group called the al-Nusra Front. The proposed U.S. mission to strike Khorasan didn't get far because, at the time, the White House wasn't ready to launch strikes in Syria or Iraq.\n\nOfficials and analysts say the group assuredly exists; and it is dangerous.\n\n\"Not much is known about them, so tracing their pedigree is difficult,\" said Bruce Hoffman, the head of the Security Studies Department at Georgetown University. \"But that doesn't surprise me. Terrorist groups throughout history have used highly secretive clandestine strike units to do their bidding that were concealed even from the wider organization. Black September in the 1970s was never known at the time to be part of the Fatah or part of the PLO. It was very much a mystery organization and had multinational commando units, just like the fighters we understand Khorasan has.\"\n\nThe multinational nature of Khorasan \u2014 which includes Palestinians, Afghans, Chechnyans, Yemenis and Egyptians, just to name a few \u2014 is part of what is sparking concern among intelligence officials. They say there is some evidence to suggest that fighters who trained with a master bomb maker from al-Qaida's arm in Yemen have arrived in Syria to help Khorasan launch terrorist attacks against the West.\n\nThe target list that the Joint Special Operations Command put together this summer was in response to a concern that Khorasan would be able to put hard-to-detect bombs on airliners. The Transportation Security Administration issued a warning in July for airlines to step up screening \u2014 though it did not say at the time that the threat had come from Khorasan.\n\nThe White House approved strikes against Khorasan in September.\n\n\"The real importance of the Khorasan Group is that it challenges the conventional wisdom that al-Qaida Core, the al-Qaida senior leadership, has been so degraded as to be inconsequential,\" Hoffman said. \"Its fundamental objective is as a means to project al-Qaida's core power further afield than South Asia.\"\n\nThe leader of Core al-Qaida, Zawahiri, is believed to have dispatched the Khorasan members to Syria about 18 months ago. They were supposed to try to reconcile bickering al-Qaida affiliates in Syria and Iraq and set up an external operations unit.\n\nWhat makes Khorasan different from al-Qaida's affiliates such as the ones in Yemen or Somalia is that it is about more than just attacks. Officials say it is both a consultative body \u2014 something known in Arabic as a shura \u2014 as well as a forward operating base for Core al-Qaida. Khorasan is thought to have had a key role in trying to patch up the differences between the group known as ISIS and the Nusra Front. However, efforts at reconciliation this past summer failed, and ISIS broke from al-Qaida and renamed itself the Islamic State. Those reconciliation talks are thought to be starting anew in the wake of U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic State. Islamic State fighters and the Nusra Front are beginning to explore whether they should band together; Khorasan's leaders are thought to be facilitating those discussions.\n\nKhorasan is thought to be made up of 40 to 60 key al-Qaida people who brought with them to Syria another 100 or so drivers, note-takers and other support staff. They have set up shop among Nusra Front fighters. Analysts say the relationship is a bit like the Taliban and al-Qaida before the Sept. 11 attacks. Al-Qaida needed the logistical support and sanctuary the Taliban provided them before 2001. Officials say that's exactly the role the Nusra Front plays with the Khorasan group.\n\nThat the group numbers well over 100 people goes a long way toward explaining why the Pentagon reported that there were eight strikes against Khorasan outside Aleppo, Syria, on the first night of U.S.-led airstrikes. It also explains why targets associated with the Nusra Front were hit in those strikes. Officials say it is nearly impossible to target Khorasan without targeting the Nusra Front, too.\n\nTraining camps, explosives facilities and other operational targets were destroyed, but it is unclear how many \u2014 and who \u2014 from the Khorasan Group were killed.\n\nThe only member of Khorasan who has been talked about publicly is a man named Mohsin al-Fadhli. He is widely reported to be the group's leader, and there is some question as to whether he was killed in those first airstrikes in September. U.S. officials say they do not believe al-Fadhli is the group's leader; rather, he is Khorasan's No. 3 man, in charge of the group's external operations \u2014 in other words, in charge of launching attacks against the West.\n\nOfficials are equally concerned about the man they believe might be directing the group: an Egyptian named Mohammed Islambouli. He is very close to al-Zawahiri, and his older brother is one of the Egyptian army officers who assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Mohammed Islamboui is said to be an expert in hijacking planes.\n\nU.S. officials say Khorasan is more sophisticated than a simple al-Qaida affiliate. Zawahiri sent the group to Syria to set up a beachhead for al-Qaida Core recruiting, as well. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, says the group is successfully persuading recruits who arrive in Syria to join al-Qaida or defect from other groups.\n\n\"I think al-Qaida properly sees Syria and Iraq as being key to this generation of jihadists,\" he says. \"The number of foreign fighters who have been attracted to the battlefield is immense. The Syria State is not going to be put back together, and it is the heart of the Middle East so it could be used as a launching pad to destabilize a large number of countries around there.\"\n\nAnd, he adds, it is breathing fresh life into Core al-Qaida."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2014/09/17/349192697/congressional-panels-chastise-nhtsa-over-gm-ignition-problems", "text": "Congressional Panels Chastise NHTSA Over GM Ignition Problems\n\nCommittees are looking at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after questions arose about how it handles recalls, including General Motors' recall over faulty ignition switches.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, also known as NHTSA, is coming under fire from Congress. A House panel really overlooked or failed to understand early warnings of ignition problems in some GM cars. The automaker began recalling the cars earlier this year. A Senate panel meanwhile grilled the acting head of the agency, saying that it's grown too close to the automakers it's supposed to be regulating. NPR's Brian Naylor reports.\n\nBRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: The report was released by Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. They say the safety agency ignored reports in a 2006 crash that killed two teenagers in Wisconsin. A state trooper investigating the crash found that the car's airbags failed to deploy because the car's ignition switch was in the accessory position. But NHTSA overlooked the flaw, according to the report. Nineteen deaths have been linked to the ignition switch problem. On the other side of the Capitol, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri said NHTSA was too cozy with the industry.\n\nSENATOR CLAIRE MCCASKILL: That reflects obviously on an agency that is perhaps more interested in singing \"Kumbaya\" with the manufacturers than being a cop on the beat.\n\nNAYLOR: Lawmakers were critical that the agency made it optional for auto companies to answer a basic question about what may have caused fatal crashes and that no changes have been made at the agency since the recalls began in February. David Friedman is NHTSA's deputy administrator. He said it's not the safety agency but GM that bears the blame for the ignition problem.\n\nDAVID FRIEDMAN: It wasn't simply incompetence on their part. They had policies in place to not mention the word defect in order to shield information from NHTSA. They were actively trying to hide the ball. NHTSA was working hard to find the ball and was missing critical information.\n\nNAYLOR: But Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts wasn't buying that explanation.\n\nSENATOR ED MARKEY: I'm gravely disappointed in the Transportation Department's failure to accept even a shred of responsibility.\n\nNAYLOR: Friedman says the agency needs more money to do its work and that it has gotten tougher on automakers, imposing $140 million in fines over the last five years. And he said he's ended the practice, dating back to the Bush administration, of making answers to questions about what caused a fatal accident optional.\n\nFRIEDMAN: I've personally met individually with 12 major auto manufacturers with a very clear message. There is zero tolerance for failure to quickly notify the agency of a safety defect.\n\nNAYLOR: Lawmakers say the Obama administration also needs to nominate a permanent administrator for the agency. Friedman has been acting as head of NHTSA since December. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 NPR. All rights reserved.

She said she's determined the additional fatalities using crash data, police reports or eyewitnesses [who reported] the airbags did not deploy.\"\n\nGM has announced the recall of 2.6 million vehicles to search for the faulty ignition switches.\n\nChristian was reunited with Amber, her biological daughter, a year before the girl's fatal accident at age 16.\n\nAmber's accident was attributed to a faulty ignition switch in her Chevrolet Cobalt, which apparently shut off the engine while the car was in motion \u2013 cutting power to the air bags, which didn't inflate when the car hit a tree in Dentsville, Md.\n\nBut alcohol and excessive speed were also cited as factors in the crash, although Christian insists she's \"very confident\" that her daughter would have survived if airbags had deployed as designed.\n\n\"I spoke to the EMTs shortly after [the accident] and they told me that had the airbags deployed that she would have been injured, but she would have been alive today,\" she tells ATC host Robert Siegel.\n\nChristian believes that Congress should increase the maximum of $35 million penalty for delaying the reporting of potentially life-threatening problems.\n\n\"That may sound like a lot to us as individuals, but to a corporation like GM, who made over $3 billion last year, that's nothing. It's hardly a deterrent,\" she says.\n\nShe also wants passage of a bill sponsored by Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal to require earlier reporting of defects to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA.\n\n\"It shouldn't come to a fatality, especially when it's coming from a car that has a defective part,\" Christian says. \"GM knew about this defect, they knew about it in 2001, they OK'd it going forward. They should have been required to pass on that information to the NHTSA from day one.\"\n\nIn testimony on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, GM CEO Mary Barra expressed \"sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall ... especially to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you why it took years for a safety defect to be announced,\" Barra said in her opening testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"I can tell you that we will find out.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/02/11/275506262/graco-recalls-nearly-3-8-million-child-car-seats", "text": "Graco Recalls Nearly 3.8 Million Child Car Seats\n\ntoggle caption Graco\n\nGraco is recalling nearly 3.8 million car seats because buckles may be hard to release, posing a danger in the case of an accident.\n\nThe AP reports that despite the massive recall, which involves 11 models sold from 2009 through 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is unhappy with the company.\n\nNHTSA wants Graco to recall an additional 1.8 million rear-facing infant car seats because they suffer from the same problem, regulators say.

Pedestrians account for 13 percent of all motor-vehicle traffic deaths, even though walking accounts for 10.5 percent of trips.\n\nThe CDC data crunchers looked at pedestrian deaths from 2001 to 2010, to get a grasp of differences in sex, age and ethnicity.

But pedestrian deaths remain disproportionately high, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe researchers also looked at ethnicity, and found higher rates of pedestrian deaths among Native American, Alaska Native populations and Hispanics.\n\nGiven that the American population is getting older and more ethnically diverse, pedestrian safety efforts may need to focus on how to reduce risk for groups who are already more likely to be killed crossing the street, Beck says."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2013/03/19/174667761/double-take-toons-safety-worst", "text": "Double Take 'Toons: Safety Worst?\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration has announced that on April 25, it will lift carry-on restrictions on small knives along with sporting equipment, like golf clubs, heretofore barred.

Not car enthusiasts; car makers. My grandfather worked for General Motors in Detroit on the assembly line beginning in the 1940s. My mother was a middle manager at Ford's Chicago assembly plant in the '70s. I worked at the same plant during summers in the '90s. Today, one of my cousins works for Chrysler and another works for an auto supplier.\n\nLike millions of other African-American families, my family went from being small-town subsistence farmers to being middle- and upper-class workers thanks to the U.S. auto industry. For my family, \"buying American\" has been a manifestation of not only patriotism but racial pride.\n\nBut what does it mean to buy American? The auto industry has changed profoundly since my grandfather took the train from Thomasville, Ga., to Detroit during World War II.\n\nBecause of transportation costs and global currency fluctuations, among other things, car makers in the last 30 years have started making cars closer to where they are sold. As a result, the nationality of the car companies can get a little complicated.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issues a report each year that details the cars that are made in America. The report looks at where the parts, the transmission and the engine come from.\n\nAccording to the latest report, the most \"American car\" is the Toyota Avalon, which is built in Georgetown, Ky. Eighty-five percent of that car's parts are sourced from the U.S and Canada \u2014 a higher percentage than for any car made by a U.S.-based manufacturer. Honda just celebrated its 30th anniversary in the U.S.\n\nIt's not just about currency fluctuations and labor costs. Car companies need to build cars where they sell so they can build the right car, according to Rebecca Lindland, Director of Research for IHS Automotive. \"You have to be local to understand what motivates that person to spend six months of their pay on your product.\"\n\nThe industry is converging in terms of style, design, feel and quality. \"Twenty years ago [an] American car drove in a very distinct way compared with [a] foreign car,\" says Joe DeMatio, Deputy Editor of Automobile Magazine. \"That's disappearing.\"\n\nAs foreign car makers have expanded in the U.S., U.S. automakers have expanded overseas.

But anyone who's ever chauffeured a bunch of second-graders can tell you that the day will come when you don't have enough boosters to go around. Faced with this obvious safety risk, most parents (including this one) buckle up the kids without boosters, and pray.\n\nThat's confirmed by a new survey in this week's Pediatrics, which found that parents are good at using booster seats when driving 4- to 8-year-olds in the family car, with 76 percent using boosters.\n\nBut they were not so good when carpooling. Only half make their children use booster seats when they are riding in the family car with friends who don't have boosters, and 21 percent let their own child ride booster-less when in someone else's car.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nSome parents resorted to obviously unsafe choices, including buckling two children in one seat belt, or putting a child in the cargo area.\n\nThat means a lot of children are being exposed to the risk of serious injury. Children in this age range still aren't big enough to be safely restrained by car seat belts. Using a booster to position the lap and seat belt properly reduces injury risk by half.\n\nThe 681 parents surveyed said they didn't use booster seats for a number of reasons, including difficulty getting seats from other parents, and being unable to fit enough seats in the car.\n\nLegal pressure clearly helps; parents were far more likely to use boosters if they live in one of the 47 states that require them for children up to 4 feet 9 inches in height. (Here's an earlier NPR story on state efforts to require booster seats.)\n\nI've never known a child injured in a car crash, even though it's the most common cause of death in children ages 3 to 14. But I figured I should find out what can happen to a child if they're in an accident without a booster seat. It's not pretty. In this 2005 study, eight children ages 4 to 8 who were wearing only seat belts suffered serious abdominal injuries. Five broke their spine. And four are permanently paralyzed.

The device helps drivers see people or objects in their blind spots using a tiny camera mounted to the back of the car.\n\nFederal safety officials say nearly 300 deaths and 18,000 injuries occur each year from so-called backover crashes. Children under 5 years old represent about 44 percent of the fatalities, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says.\n\nTo address the problem, Gentex Corp., based in the small town of Zeeland, Mich., makes mirrors called a rear camera display. Using them is like looking at a TV and seeing a picture within the picture.\n\nThe 3.3-inch-diagonal LCD display is very bright and has high resolution because it's backlit by 80 white LED lights. This built-in screen displays the picture of what's behind the vehicle using a tiny camera mounted on the back of a vehicle.\n\nGentex has years of experience putting high-tech features into low-tech mirrors. For example, it's been making rearview mirrors that automatically dim for nighttime driving for more than 20 years.\n\nWatch a Gentex video about how the technology works.\n\nYouTube\n\nAll of those electronics have made rearview mirrors more costly. Gentex says the rear camera display mirror can cost automakers around $75 per vehicle. Normal mirrors \u2014 without the high-tech features \u2014 cost carmakers less than $10.\n\nTesting Blind Spots\n\nI put Gentex's new display mirrors to the test in an Acura sedan.\n\nWith a standard rearview mirror, I can't see 32-inch cones that are more than 20 feet behind me because they're in a blind spot. I also can't see a little bike that is 15 feet behind me.\n\n\"So, if there was a child on that bike, riding by you as you started your car in the morning to back up for work you would not see that little kid behind your car,\" says Craig Piersma, the director of product marketing for Gentex.\n\nFor most cars, that blind zone is about 10 to 15 feet.

But I can make it out the instant I put the car in gear.\n\nDavid Champion, the senior director of Consumer Reports' auto test division, says the mirrors are a promising safety advancement. But he warns that the camera location can make all the difference. That's because automakers have control over where to place the camera on the rear of the vehicle.\n\n\"Some people put it sort of underneath the lip of the trunk lid above the license plate, which seems to collect a lot of dirt in that area,\" Champion says. \"Especially in these winter conditions where you have muck on the road and it sprays up, that reduces the visibility tremendously of what you can see behind.\"\n\nWeighing A Federal Requirement\n\nGentex has been shipping the rear camera display mirrors to carmakers for nearly four years.

McCarthy, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, is the author, most recently, of The Grand Jihad: How Islam and the Left Sabotage America.\n\nMore years ago than I care to remember, I prosecuted some violent drug dealers. During the trial, we got some reliable information that their associates were transferring contraband to them in prison, and they were smuggling some of it into the courtroom. Federal marshals were rightly concerned that some items could be used as weapons.\n\nWe tailored a response to the circumstances. As any reasonable person would appreciate, that meant weighing the danger involved, the adequacy of various protective steps to counter the danger, the rights of people who would be affected, and the fact that our main concern was security \u2014 not collecting evidence in anticipation of bringing charges.\n\nI agreed that the indicted defendants should be subjected to daily strip searches upon leaving and returning to prison \u2014 including cavity searches, since body cavities are notorious repositories of makeshift weapons and narcotics. This was appropriate not only because of the threat involved but because of that threat coupled with significant facts about the people involved. The indicted defendants had violent histories that included threats to kill witnesses and an attempt to murder an undercover police officer. They were in custody despite not yet having been convicted, because a judge had denied bail based on evidence that they posed a danger to the community. We had now caught them with items they were not supposed to have in the courtroom.\n\nPeople in prison are subject to highly intrusive searches; they have no expectation of privacy. To be sure, the government is given more latitude \u2014 relieved of the need to show probable cause for the search \u2014 because it is promoting safety, not trying to develop a prosecutable case. But what makes the search appropriate is the record of the people involved, not the abstract possibility of violence. A savage act is always possible. If that is all it took to justify gross infringements of liberty, such infringements would always and everywhere be justified. An intrusive search is reasonable, or not, based on what the people involved have done to prompt it, not simply because life is fraught with peril.\n\nThe remaining people coming to the courtroom each day presented circumstances very different from the defendants. There were the defendants' family members and associates, other trial participants (jurors, court reporters, the judge, and the lawyers for each side), some members of the press, and spectators (ordinary people who would come by to watch trials).\n\nThe family members and associates were neither charged nor in custody, though some were suspected of collusion in the drug dealers' activities. Like all members of the public, they had had to pass through cursory courthouse screening upon entering the building. This included the presentation of identification and passing through a magnetometer \u2014 which, while far from perfect in ferreting out weapons, does detect guns, knives, and other metal objects. So we opted against any further physical searches absent some new indication that one of these folks possessed an item that could be used as a weapon. Still, the marshals were instructed to watch them carefully in the courtroom and keep them physically separated from the defendants \u2014 if contact was sought for some reason, defense lawyers could ask the judge for permission and the judge could then work with the marshals to set the ground rules.\n\nAs for the remaining trial attendees, all of whom had also gone through the screening process, there was no reason for added concern. Of course the threat situation dictated that the marshals remain on their toes. But a pro can easily do that without hassling everyone in sight. And that's exactly how these pros handled it: smoothly, realistically balancing the risk of something terrible being attempted against the huge unlikelihood of its being attempted by the vast majority of the people in the courtroom.\n\nImagine, though, if the marshals had said: \"Let's just cavity-search everyone \u2014 after all, you never know.\"\n\nIn essence, that is exactly what the Transportation Security Administration is doing with its perverse \u2014 in every sense of the word \u2014 security procedures. At a number of the nation's most heavily trafficked airports, in the midst of the Thanksgiving holiday, when people routinely fly in order to be with faraway loved ones, the TSA is saying: Let's suspect everyone of being a terrorist, no matter how groundless the suspicion, and move immediately to the most intrusive search procedures in our toolkit.\n\nThis is a rank violation of the Fourth Amendment. In my long-ago trial, it would have been thought obscene to make violent drug traffickers the measure of every person's privacy rights. There would have to be something more \u2014 some concrete basis for suspicion, particular to the person. Yet, the TSA is making the savage jihadist its lodestar for navigating the threat it audaciously presumes to be posed by every American.\n\nAt its website, the TSA cheerily informs us that its unnerving electro-strip searches, and the alternative you get to choose \u2014 having TSA officials grope the breasts, buttocks, and genitalia of yourself, your spouse, your children, your elderly parents, etc. \u2014 pass constitutional muster as \"administrative searches.\" Under this line of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the agency insists, a warrantless search \"is valid...if it is 'no more intrusive or intensive than necessary, in light of current technology, to detect weapons or explosives'\" \u2014 a proposition for which it quotes a Ninth Circuit case from 37 years ago (United States v. Davis). If you don't like it, the TSA concludes, you \"may avoid the search by electing not to fly.\" How very reasonable!\n\nSpeaking of reasonableness, the Supreme Court reaffirmed in the 2001 Knights case that it is \"the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment.\" Determining whether a search is reasonable requires an assessment of \"all the circumstances\" \u2014 not just the potential threat to public safety and the state of modern technology, but the intrusiveness of the proposed search, its likely effectiveness, and the degree of privacy Americans may reasonably expect from their government under the circumstances.\n\nThe threat to public safety from the terrorist use of aircraft is obviously great, but no greater than countless other scenarios. We don't unleash the government to commit what would otherwise be sexual assault and the infliction of emotional distress on nothing more than an abstract threat. The threat of terrorism is ubiquitous. On the other side of the equation, the search tactics at issue would scarcely be more of a privacy invasion if agents were stripping passengers and performing cavity searches.\n\nWorse, the tactics are ineffective. TSA chief John Pistole admits that he intentionally delayed notifying the public about the new procedures because he didn't want to tip off the terrorists. Of course, tipping them off would be irrelevant if the procedures were an ironclad protection, but they are easily evaded \u2014 by those with an interest in evading them \u2014 through choosing airports where they are not in place, using explosive components they cannot detect, and hiding components in body cavities against which the procedures are ineffective.\n\nMost significant, the government is ignoring the most material element: discrimination, based on characteristics known to be associated with the threat. Discrimination has been turned into a dirty word, but we want our law-enforcement, intelligence, and security services to employ it sensibly. If everyone is a suspect, then no one is a suspect \u2014 meaning the real threats get no real attention.\n\nWhat justified the different gradations of Fourth Amendment treatment in my courtroom years ago were the very different circumstances of each category of person. To be sure, everyone would have been safer from being attacked by a weapon if everyone had been cavity-searched. But what sense would it make if, to get to this purportedly optimal safety level, everyone had been attacked by the authorities \u2014 forcibly subjected to a humiliating search without having done a blessed thing to provoke suspicion? And is it really an answer to say, \"Well, if you don't want to endure it, stay out of the public's courthouses\"?\n\nWhether it's the case of the Christmas bomber, the Fort Hood bomber, or the World Trade Center bombers from 17 years ago, our government, again and again, has consciously avoided the common denominators of Islamist ideology and anti-American animus that should have raised caution signs. We have knowingly granted entry into our country, and often into our institutions, to people who have meant us harm. The officials whose job it is to protect us have decided to protect Muslim sensibilities by treating every American as a suspected mass-murderer. To feel better about themselves, to inoculate themselves from bogus charges of racism and Islamophobia, they have decided to mortify everyone.\n\nMany things may be said about this approach, but reasonable is not one of them.

But unintended acceleration has been a problem across the auto industry, according to an NPR analysis of consumer complaints to federal regulators.\n\nThe NPR News investigation finds that other automakers have had high rates of complaints in some model years, including Volkswagen, Volvo and Honda \u2014 in some cases resolving the apparent problems through evolving technology and recalls.\n\nThe analysis covers about 15,000 complaints filed over the past decade, covering cars back to the 1990 model year. The complaints were filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates auto safety.\n\nAs NPR's Robert Benincasa tells Michele Norris, comparing complaints with manufacturers' market share can reveal potential problems with particular makes of cars.\n\n\"Toyota's problems seemed go back to 2002,\" Benincasa said. \"That's a few years before these recalls we've been hearing about with the floor mats and the sticky gas pedals. So back in 2002, they had about 10 percent of the U.S. auto market and they had about 19 percent of the complaints on acceleration.\"\n\nWhile unintended acceleration is still generally rare, it has touched automakers throughout the industry.\n\nAs an example, Benincasa points to a high rate of complaints about acceleration in cars made by Volkswagen in 2008, \"despite the fact that the company says it's been using a system where the brake overrides the accelerator since the 2002 model year.\"\n\n\"Hondas in the 2001-2003 model years had a relatively high rate of complaints,\" Benincasa said. \"Then in 2004, the complaints dropped significantly and have remained low \u2014 and that company doesn't use a brake override approach.\"\n\nAs Toyota's problems have unfolded very publicly, amid tragic stories of runaway cars, NHTSA has also come in for criticism.\n\nIn Congress, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood recently defended the agency's response to safety problems, saying it is continuous and aggressive. Representatives of NHTSA \u2014 which is part of the Department of Transportation \u2014 declined to appear on All Things Considered to discuss NPR's analysis of the complaint data.\n\nClarence Ditlow, executive director of the watchdog group Center for Auto Safety, says regulators are not doing the kind of analysis that compares various manufacturers' complaint levels with their sales figures.\n\n\"There's no one doing it as far as I know. This is the first time I've seen an analysis like this in a long time,\" Ditlow said after reviewing some results of the NPR investigation.\n\n\"Not since the 1980s, when sudden acceleration first hit the headlines, did we see a manufacturer-based analysis of complaints,\" Ditlow said. \"But it's something the government could and should be doing every year.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2010/02/03/123327167/lahood-backs-off-stop-driving-toyotas-remark", "text": "LaHood Backs Off 'Stop Driving Toyotas' Remark\n\nTransportation Secretary Ray LaHood on Wednesday reversed his recommendation that millions of Toyota owners affected by a massive recall \"stop driving\" the autos. LaHood said he misspoke and that owners should take their vehicles to a dealership for repair of defective gas pedals.\n\nLaHood, speaking to a House Appropriations subcommittee on transportation, earlier had this advice for Toyota owners: \"Stop driving it. Take it to a Toyota dealer because they believe they have a fix for it.\"\n\nThe final word from LaHood: \"What I meant to say or what I thought I said was, if you own one of these cars or if you're in doubt, take it to the dealer and they're going to fix it.\"\n\nLaHood's comments came on the same day officials in Japan and the U.S. announced wider probes into safety issues that involve the 2010 edition of the company's top-selling Prius hybrid.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it's continuing to investigate the possibility of that electromagnetic interference might cause the throttle control systems in the vehicles to malfunction, but the agency has not seen evidence to support that yet.\n\nFurther clouding the picture for consumers: the notion that problems could extend beyond Toyota vehicles. Federal officials have widened their investigation of malfunctioning gas pedals to see if the same problem exists in cars made by other auto companies.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kyodo via AP Kyodo via AP\n\nThe traffic safety agency said it had sent a letter to CTS, the Indiana company that made the pedals for Toyota, to find out more about the pedals it has manufactured for other auto companies, including Honda, Nissan and a small number of Fords in China. CTS has been adamant that the issues are limited to Toyota alone.\n\nToyota said the sticking gas pedal situation is unusual and \"generally does not occur suddenly. In the rare instances where it does occur, the vehicle can be controlled with firm and steady application of the brakes.\"\n\nLaHood accused the world's largest automaker of dragging its feet in its response to complaints about sticking accelerators, which resulted in a global recall of 4.6 million vehicles. The 2.3 million vehicles that were recalled in the U.S. had gas pedals that were made by CTS.\n\nToyota announced earlier this week that it had a fix for the problem and that dealers would get repair kits this week. The repair involves installing a steel shim a couple of millimeters thick in the pedal assembly, behind the top of the gas pedal, to eliminate the excess friction between two pieces of the accelerator mechanism.\n\nMore On The Recall In the United States, 2.3 million cars and trucks have been affected by Toyota's Jan. 21 recall. Those models are: Certain 2009-2010 RAV4s\n\nCertain 2009-2010 Corollas\n\n2009-2010 Matrix\n\n2005-2010 Avalon\n\nCertain 2007-2010 Camrys\n\nCertain 2010 Highlanders\n\n2007-2010 Tundra\n\n2008-2010 Sequoia Toyota has said it will shut down production of the eight U.S. models during the week of Feb. 1. Sales also have been suspended, though the automaker said they can resume once the potential problem with sticky accelerators has been fixed. Customers can visit www.toyota.com/recall or call the Toyota Customer Experience Center at 800-331-4331 for more information.\n\nStill, Toyota is facing growing criticism that it has not done enough to ensure the safety of its vehicles. In Japan, Toyota Vice President Shinichi Sasaki acknowledged that officials decided on the U.S. recall because of prodding from NHTSA.\n\nLaHood said the U.S. government is considering civil penalties against the company for not addressing safety concerns faster.\n\nPaul Eisenstein, publisher of the online automotive magazine TheDetroitBureau.com, said LaHood's shocking advice to Toyota owners might reflect the exasperation over the extent of the Toyota recall \u2014 as well as the growing sense that the public may not know everything.\n\n\"If it's found out that Toyota knew more than it's let on and longer than it's let on, I think this administration will move for civil penalties,\" Eisenstein said.\n\nComplaints Over Prius Brakes\n\nEisenstein said his publication first reported on complaints of problems with the company's top-selling Prius hybrid six weeks ago.\n\nIn Japan, the company acknowledged Wednesday it is investigating potential problems with the brakes in the Prius.\n\nBut the fix for the sticking accelerators hasn't ended the Japanese automaker's problems. In Japan, the company acknowledged it is also investigating potential problems with the brakes in the top-selling Prius hybrid.\n\nJapanese Transport Ministry official Masaya Ota said the government has received 14 complaints since July about the 2010 Prius model. The complaints include a head-on car crash at an intersection in which the Prius' brakes allegedly failed, Ota said. Two people were slightly injured in the wreck.\n\n\"The Prius driver in the accident told police that a brake did not work,\" he said. \"Other Prius drivers also complained brakes were not so sharp.\" The complaints in Japan involved vehicles that were made in Japan, he said.\n\nIn the U.S., NHTSA has received about 100 complaints involving the brakes of the new Prius model. Two crashes resulted in injuries.\n\nEisenstein said if the much-lauded Prius is tainted by safety issues, it could send the company over the edge despite having a huge reservoir of goodwill.\n\nToyota Safety Concerns Multiply\n\nToyota is now facing safety concerns on three fronts: accelerator pedals that stick when depressed, along with an earlier, similar problem in which accelerator pedals got stuck in floor mats; potential electrical problems; and problems with the brakes in the Prius.\n\nThe company has seen auto sales in the U.S. and elsewhere plummet following massive recalls and the temporary halt of sales of eight models \u2014 including the popular Camry and Corolla. Toyota's January sales fell below 100,000 a month for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nJessica Caldwell, a senior analyst for Edmunds.com, said the way the dealerships handle the repairs will be a big factor in whether Toyota retains or loses its customers.\n\n\"The dealership is really going to make or break Toyota in how they handle these recalls,\" Caldwell said. \"Especially with something safety-related, you have to treat people well.\" She predicted customers will be willing to give the automaker another chance because Toyota has had a good track record for safety and reliability.\n\nStill, Toyota is facing growing criticism that it has not done enough to ensure the safety of its vehicles.\n\nLaHood said Tuesday that the government was considering civil penalties for Toyota for having dragged its feet on safety concerns.\n\nToyota's executive vice president, Shinichi Sasaki, acknowledged Tuesday in a news conference from Nagoya, Japan, that it took prodding from NHTSA officials for the company to decide on the U.S. recall.\n\nWritten and reported by NPR's Deborah Tedford, with reporting by Anthony Kuhn, Carol Van Dam and The Associated Press"}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2009/08/14/111899519/letters-planes-classic-clunkers-folsom-prison", "text": "Letters: Planes; 'Classic' Clunkers; Folsom Prison\n\nWe hear a clarification on the TSA's requirements for airline passenger information, a classic car enthusiast on \"cash for clunkers\" and praise Laura Sullivan's story about California's Folsom Prison.\n\nMELISSA BLOCK, host:\n\nWe begin today's letter segment with a correction.

Bush can be heard \u2014 and downloaded \u2014 here.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images Paul J.

The World Trade Center. The panic in New York City. The smoke billowing from the Pentagon. The crash site in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor President Bush, the first moments of the crisis seemed halting. He was reading to schoolchildren in Florida as his chief of staff whispered in his ear. The president's face seemed to go blank as he processed the horrible news.\n\nA half-hour later, he made his first statement to the nation: \"I have ordered that the full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families, and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act.\"\n\nThat day, the president flew, for security reasons, to a base in Louisiana, then another in Nebraska before going back to Washington to address the nation again from the Oval Office.\n\nThe public rallied behind him. He delivered a moving speech at a prayer service at the National Cathedral days later, then traveled to ground zero.\n\n\"I can hear you,\" he shouted through a bullhorn to cheers. \"The rest of the world hears you. And the people who ... knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\"\n\nIn Defense Of National Security\n\nThe White House went on war footing after Sept. 11. Tight security got tighter, public tours were curtailed, presidential schedules were less detailed, secrecy flourished \u2014 all in the name of national security.\n\nResponding to the attacks and framing every policy in terms of the attacks became the theme of the era.\n\nIt is hard to overstate how different this was from what candidate George W. Bush had foreseen. Less than a year earlier, in the final weeks of the 2000 campaign, Bush described himself as promoting a \"humble\" foreign policy.\n\n\"I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, 'We do it this way; so should you,' \" he said.\n\nCompare that with his message to nations around the world as delivered to a joint session of Congress the week following Sept. 11: \"Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\"\n\nHistorian Robert Dallek says Sept. 11 had a profound impact on how the president was viewed. \"It gave him a surge of influence and standing, not just at home but around the world,\" Dallek says.\n\nThe Axis Of Evil And The Bush Doctrine\n\nA few months later, Bush had a warning for Iraq, Iran and North Korea. \"States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world,\" he said in his State of the Union Address. \"By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger.\"\n\nThe axis of evil speech was a sign of things to come. It signaled the coming of the so-called \"Bush doctrine,\" which represented a major change in the United States' approach to the world. The doctrine embraced the concept of a pre-emptive war, an attack on a country deemed to pose a threat to the U.S. \u2014 even if that threat remained theoretical.\n\n\"Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent,\" Bush said. \"Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike?\"\n\nThe concept of pre-emptive war would become reality in Iraq. The administration said Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was threatening to use weapons of mass destruction \u2014 implying that these might soon include nuclear weapons.\n\nEven though allied forces invading Iraq found no such weapons, Bush would continue to justify the incursion by talking about Sept. 11. He would eventually admit that there was no evidence of a connection between Iraq and the Sept. 11 plotters.\n\nThe Iraq war also increased tension between the U.S. and its allies. The president took a tough stand with the United Nations, saying that the U.S. would consult the U.N. but not trust Saddam Hussein. \"If necessary, we will lead a coalition to disarm him,\" Bush said.\n\nImmediately after Sept. 11, the U.S. had received an outpouring of support from around the world. With the Iraq war, that changed to doubt and then to outright opposition.\n\nThe Expansion Of Executive Authority\n\nBacked by popular support at home, however, President Bush pushed several measures through Congress, including the Patriot Act. The controversial legislation gave law enforcement enhanced powers to track potential terrorist activity, such as access to e-mail, telephone, health, financial and other records.\n\nThe president also established the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and he created a sprawling new Department of Homeland Security, which included a powerful new Transportation Security Administration.\n\nThough Americans wouldn't learn of it until years later, the administration also set up secret prisons for suspected terrorists in Eastern Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department redefined what it means to torture to allow waterboarding.\n\nWhen any of these measures drew criticism, the administration would invoke Sept. 11.\n\nThe same kind of leverage was used to increase executive authority, fulfilling a cherished goal of Vice President Dick Cheney going back decades to the time he was President Gerald Ford's chief of staff.\n\n\"Time after time, administrations have traded away the authority of the president to do his job,\" Cheney told Fox News in 2002. \"We're not going to do that in this administration. The president's bound and determined to defend those principles, and to pass on this office, his and mine, to future generations in better shape than we found it.\"\n\nThe first president to inherit these enhanced powers will be Barack Obama, who spoke out against them in his campaign for the White House. He has pledged to close Guantanamo and to reduce the U.S. presence in Iraq. But no new occupant of the Oval Office can escape the grim legacy of Sept. 11 \u2014 and all of the presidential actions that followed."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2007/01/25/7022287/the-dispute-over-security-screeners-and-unions", "text": "The Dispute over Security Screeners and Unions\n\nThe new Democratic congressional majority is trying to give federal airport screeners the right to collective bargaining.

The NHTSA will issue a ruling on April 1. Wall Street Journal reporter Laura Meckler talks with Robert Siegel.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, host:\n\nCAFE standards are corporate average fuel economy standards, C-A-F-E. It's the number of miles per gallon an automaker should get for the range of vehicles the company sells. One anomaly of the CAFE standards is that they don't include the entire range. Back in the 1970s, when the system began, the thought of a family driving around in something the size of a Hummer II was about as ludicrous as watching television on a 50-inch screen or owning your own computer at home. Well times have changed and, according to the Wall Street Journal, the Bush Administration is considering including some of the biggest vehicles, ones that weigh between 8,500 and 10,000 pounds, in new CAFE standards. Journal reporter Laura Meckler writes about this today. Welcome to the program, Laura.\n\nMs. LAURA MECKLER (Reporter, Wall Street Journal): Thank you.\n\nSIEGEL: First, as you point out in the newspaper today, this wouldn't affect a tremendous number of vehicles, what's being considered.\n\nMs. MECKLER: No. There really aren't that many vehicles that fall into this class. Specifically what we're talking about is the very, very largest SUVs and passenger vans.\n\nSIEGEL: Some model names that we would recognize?\n\nMs. MECKLER: Well, of course, you mentioned the Hummer, and that's the poster child for this group. And then you've got the Yukon XL, the Chevy Suburban, as well, and then there are some passenger vans as well, such as the Ford E Series, some of the bigger ones.\n\nSIEGEL: Now, some context here. Why is the administration considering their inclusion in the standards now?\n\nMs. MECKLER: Well, I think that they're looking at it and saying that, yes, these are vehicles that are being used by families. They are being used on the road in a regular way. And they may not deserve the exemption that was justified back when these rules were written. And because they're sort of taking a big look at the whole CAFE standard for light trucks, this is an opportunity for them to revisit this issue.\n\nSIEGEL: Well, taking this idea, who's for it and who's against it?\n\nMs. MECKLER: Well, the allies and opponents are pretty predictable. The people who are for it are the environmentalists. Also groups like AAA have weighed in for it. Opposing it are the car companies, especially, for instance, GM, which already has a lot of problems and says they can't really afford to deal with another one.\n\nSIEGEL: Well, we've already heard about some of GM's other problems, but in this case, they just happen to have more of the models in this group.\n\nMs. MECKLER: Exactly. The administration estimates that this particular change would affect GM more than any other manufacturer by far.\n\nSIEGEL: Well, let's say you make the Hummer II and a new regulation comes out and says that that class of vehicles has to get more miles per gallon. What does the carmaker do to the car, presumably, to try to meet new standards?\n\nMs. MECKLER: Well, the carmaker would have a bunch of different options, depending on exactly how the rule was written. One thing that they could do is they could improve the engineering of the vehicle. They could use different technology, maybe a hybrid technology, or something that would help increase the mileage. They could also use more expensive but lighter weight materials, maybe more aluminum in the vehicle, and that would make it lighter and therefore would make it more fuel-efficient. They also could...\n\nSIEGEL: Well, it wouldn't have the same feel, I should think, as the current Hummer II.\n\nMs. MECKLER: Perhaps not. I'm sure, though, that they would, it would be important to them to keep that feel the same, because that's obviously what's attracting buyers. But they would have a variety of options of how to deal with it. They also, depending on how the CAFE program is written, they might be able to balance that out if they didn't quite meet the standard with some of their other vehicle sales.\n\nSIEGEL: Now what's interesting to me here is that the category of vehicles we're talking about is rather small, but in fact the category of pickup trucks is very large. And no one's proposing that they be included in the CAFE standards within the administration.\n\nMs. MECKLER: Right. I mean, that is theoretically on the table. They could do that if they wanted to. But the thinking is that they probably won't do that, because generally speaking, pickup trucks that are that big are often being used for a business or for a farm, and they don't want to do anything to really depress that market.\n\nSIEGEL: Well, Laura Meckler, thank you very much for talking with us.\n\nMs. MECKLER: My pleasure.\n\nSIEGEL: That's reporter Laura Meckler, of the Wall Street Journal.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.

A man close to the Saudi government is trying to explain the government's conduct. Ali Shihabi is founder of the Arabia Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank that aims to provide a better picture of the Saudi monarchy. And he spoke to Steve Inskeep.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: After Jamal Khashoggi was killed, Shihabi, on social media, was one of the few public defenders of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The de facto Saudi leader is blamed by U.S. intelligence agencies for the killing but has not been accused by his own government. Shihabi answered a long-standing invitation to come by our studios. He has short hair and black-rimmed glasses and wears a blazer. He says he knew Khashoggi, both in Saudi Arabia and later when both lived in Washington. And he did not agree with the journalist's criticisms of the Saudi government.\n\nALI SHIHABI: It was a little bit playing to what he thought the American audience in Washington wanted to hear. I think he understood the nuances of what were happening in Saudi Arabia much more than he let on in his columns.\n\nINSKEEP: You don't believe he was honest in his criticism of the government?\n\nSHIHABI: Well, no, I think he was honest in his criticism of the government, but I think that he underplayed some of the complexities that he was part of. You remember, you have to remember that Jamal was an editor of a Saudi government paper, effectively, owned by the royal family. So he was, if you want, an apparatchik in the system. But I think he underplayed the challenges that the crown prince had to overcome.\n\nINSKEEP: Are we learning here why he would have so irritated someone in Saudi Arabia because he would be seen as an insider, someone who had been part of the system then criticizing the system?\n\nSHIHABI: He didn't really irritate people that much. He was not a threat. I think as this thing is being investigated, what happens sometimes is elements in the security service or people who are responsible for internal security tend to magnify issues. And there was an overreaction to it, and obviously, it was a criminal overreaction 'cause ultimately...\n\nINSKEEP: If you'll forgive me - there are overreactions, and there overreactions.\n\nSHIHABI: Well, it's a criminal overreaction.\n\nINSKEEP: This case, according to a Turkish newspaper, 15 Saudi officials, 15 Saudi government functionaries, gathered to assassinate a man and cut him apart with a bone saw. I mean, this is not, like - it's hard to believe that he wasn't considered a severe problem by someone.\n\nSHIHABI: No. He was considered a severe problem by someone. And I said it was a criminal overreaction. And I think what's happening in Saudi Arabia now is there is a serious investigation going on, and the Turks have not been helpful because the Saudi prosecutor has been asking, for example, for the recordings. The Turks have been releasing leaks right, left and center.\n\nThey've given the Saudi prosecutors the transcripts, but they have not given them the recordings. And the Saudi government is trying to make an effort to pursue a proper legal process. People don't seem to take that with a lot of credibility, if they're trying.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, why should people consider that credible when it is a private process? It's not a transparent process in any way. We're told that some people are being put on trial. We don't even know the names of the people put on trial.\n\nSHIHABI: Well, because under Saudi law, again - you know, you want people to respect the rule of law, but you don't bother to find out what that country's law is. Under Saudi law, unless you are convicted, your name does not get published. Now, having said that, foreign ambassadors were invited to the courtroom to watch the beginning of the trial. So...\n\nINSKEEP: The beginning.\n\nSHIHABI: ...The Saudi government is making an effort to pursue a credible legal process, to document it correctly, to get the correct evidence under Saudi law.\n\nINSKEEP: You've said that the Saudi prosecutor's not been supplied with the tapes. But, of course, Americans have heard the tapes. The CIA has heard the tapes. The CIA has briefed the United States Senate. The Senate voted unanimously, if I'm not mistaken, to condemn Saudi Arabia. And senators have identified the Saudi crown prince as responsible. Can you give us any reasonable doubt that Mohammed bin Salman would have been involved in such a large and sophisticated operation?\n\nSHIHABI: Yes, I can. Because first of all, the CIA gave a medium-to-high assessment that they thought the crown prince was involved. And as I've said before, with all due respect to the CIA, maybe their understanding of what happens in the inner, inner sanctums of the royal palace is isn't perfect.\n\nYes, I think they were authorized to go and interrogate him and maybe to bring him back or to try and bring him back. But it was an operation that was carried, in a way, off the grid. In other words, it was not carried out by the professional elements within Saudi intelligence. It was a team put together from different parts of the security services...\n\nINSKEEP: Including some people close to the crown prince, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nSHIHABI: People who have been pictured physically close to the crown prince because they're part of the security services. It's like taking a picture of a Secret Service officer next to President Trump and saying President Trump was involved because this gentleman happens to be close to the president.\n\nINSKEEP: Even before Khashoggi was killed...\n\nSHIHABI: Yes.\n\nINSKEEP: ...He felt, in order to speak as he wished and be safe, he needed to be outside of Saudi Arabia.\n\nSHIHABI: Yes.\n\nINSKEEP: Is it right that it should be so?\n\nSHIHABI: No. But the kingdom is going through a wrenching process of cultural, social and religious reform.\n\nINSKEEP: Is it moving toward freedom of speech?\n\nSHIHABI: Well, it has - freedom of speech has actually been contracting for the last two years because during this process, which is very contentious, and particularly when you are taking on a reactionary conservative class and religious establishment, a lot of the things that the crown prince has done - not just allowing women to drive, but integrating women into the labor force - so much has happened to quote-unquote \"liberalize\" society that has been fought extremely aggressively by the religious class. And we have seen what happened to other people who have tried to address the conservative class in the Middle East and have been overthrown.\n\nINSKEEP: You're trying to explain to me why political activists have been arrested even in this period of supposed reform?\n\nSHIHABI: Yes, because it's not political reform. It is social. It's cultural. It's economic. And it's an interpretation of religion. For example, everybody's complained about exporting Wahhabism. Right? That Saudi Arabia exports Wahhabism. He has taken a baseball bat to that process in the last two years.\n\nINSKEEP: But there are also been more liberal activists within the country who've been arrested, right?\n\nSHIHABI: Yes, there have. There have. And I think, you know, one of the big mistakes that I think the government did was arresting many of these women. And I anticipate that over the next number of months, a number of these - particularly, women - dissidents will be let out of jail.\n\nINSKEEP: Ali Shihabi, thanks for coming by.\n\nSHIHABI: Thank you, Steve, for inviting me.\n\nINSKEEP: Ali Shihabi heads the Arabia Foundation, which is linked with the Saudi government and based in Washington.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this story, we say the Arabia Foundation is linked with the Saudi government. A more accurate characterization is that the two are connected.]\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

She was fatally shot while sitting in the car with her mother and siblings on the morning of Dec. 30.\n\nInitial reports stated that the shooter was a white man. Those reports led to a national outcry that this was a racially motivated attack. Activists and politicians demanded that the shooting be investigated as a hate crime. But in the days since the shooting, deputies in Harris County have charged two black men in relation to the shooting.\n\nGene Demby spoke to David Greene of Morning Edition about what this incident reveals about the current landscape of race and violence in the United States.\n\nThe interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nDavid Greene: Could you walk us through the timeline of events in this story?\n\nGene Demby: Jazmine Barnes was in a car with her mother and three sisters on Dec. 30 near a Walmart when shots rang out. Her mother was shot in the arm but survived. But Jazmine, who was 7, was shot in the head and died at the scene. The other girls in the car during the shooting said the gunshots came from a red pickup truck driven by a white male. And The New York Times reports that there was another still unsolved shooting in 2017 in the same area that witnesses say was committed by a white man in a Ford pickup.\n\nSo that, in combination with a police sketch of the suspect, created a real fear that this was a racially motivated attack.\n\nBut we now know that the suspected shooter was black\n\nRight. This week, the police have charged two suspects, Larry Woodruffe, the alleged shooter, and Eric Black Jr., the alleged driver. The police say they think the shooting was a case of mistaken identity. Eric Black and the alleged shooter, they say, were trying to retaliate against someone they had gotten into an argument with earlier, and they misidentified the car Jazmine Barnes was in.\n\nThe police said that they believe that both the white male and the red pickup the girls in the car saw were real, but probably belonged to an innocent bystander who sped away during the confusion of the shooting.\n\nWhat did race have to do with this story capturing national attention?\n\nIn the days after the shooting and before the arrests, Shaun King, an activist who is very prominent on social media, offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the suspect's arrest and helped publicize the police sketch of the presumed white suspect. During that same period, Sheila Jackson Lee, a congresswoman from Houston, called Barnes' killing a hate crime.\n\nThe context here is important. Remember, it was only two decades ago that a black man named James Byrd Jr. was lynched by white supremacists about two hours away from Harris County. That killing helped fuel federal hate crime legislation. More recently, there was the mass shooting by a white supremacist at a historic black church in 2015 in South Carolina, and the fatal car attack by a white nationalist in Charlottesville in [2017]. The FBI said in a report last fall that hate crimes were up 17 percent in 2017 \u2014 the third straight year that hate crimes went up. So the suspicions that this was a racially motivated attack, even though they were wrong, are based in this very real trendline around interracial violence.\n\nIf this suspect were identified as black from the beginning, how might that have changed this story?\n\nCrimes with both black victims and black perpetrators tend not to make national news. Just two weeks before Jazmine Barnes was shot, another 7-year-old in Harris County was seriously injured in a drive-by shooting. When these crimes do bubble up to this level, it's usually invoked to wave away concerns around structural racism or police violence \u2014 you know, concern-trolling like, \"Well, what about black-on-black crime?\"\n\nThere are sadly a lot of Jazmine Barneses in America, and lots of neighborhood rallies and memorials for slain little kids like her. It's telling that the relatively less common instance is one of a very few conditions in which those deaths would garner national coverage."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683662691/where-does-illegal-immigration-mostly-occur-heres-what-the-data-tell-us", "text": "Where Does Illegal Immigration Mostly Occur? Here's What The Data Tell Us\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rebecca Blackwell/AP Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMost undocumented immigrants didn't enter this country through Tijuana, where news cameras have captured images of thousands of immigrants seeking refuge during recent months.\n\nAnd they didn't enter near the border town of McAllen, Texas, which the president visited Thursday during the 20th day of a partial government shutdown fought over constructing additional barriers on the Southern border.\n\nWhen it comes to people in the country without proper documentation, the majority of them didn't cross the Mexican border at all. Most of them came to the United States legally \u2014 but then don't leave.\n\nAbout 700,000 travelers to the United States overstayed their visas in fiscal 2017, the most recent year for which the Department of Homeland Security has published figures. DHS estimated that, as of Sept. 30, 2017, the end of that fiscal year, more than 600,000 of those travelers were still in the U.S.\n\nDuring that same year, there were just 300,000 apprehensions along the Southern border, according to Customs and Border Protection \u2014 the lowest number since 1971.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nVisa overstays have outnumbered people who enter the country illegally at the Southern border every year since 2007, according to a report by the Center for Migration Studies. The report's authors estimate that the number of total visa overstays was 600,000 more than the total number of border crossers and that in 2014, visa overstays accounted for two-thirds of all new undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Southern border\n\nImmigrants traveling through Mexico, of course, take up much of the public's attention on the issue of illegal immigration. And they do account for almost all people apprehended by CBP, which includes the Border Patrol. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement largely works in the interior of the country.)\n\nThose caught by the U.S. government can apply for asylum if they can claim a credible fear that their lives would be in danger by returning to their home countries; some immigrants, in fact, turn themselves in to federal agents to do so. Apprehensions of people attempting to cross the border illegally, however, far outnumber the number of people requesting asylum at the border.\n\nThe agency catches the highest number of undocumented migrants in the Rio Grande Valley sector of south Texas. This includes McAllen, where the president visited on Thursday.\n\nIn fiscal 2018, CBP apprehended 162,000 people in the Rio Grande Valley. None of the eight other Border Patrol sectors on the Southern border had even half of that activity.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nBut another area saw apprehensions quickly rise during recent months: the El Paso sector.\n\nIn the last fiscal year, 8 percent of all apprehensions came from this area, which consists of New Mexico and a small portion of West Texas, including the city of El Paso. But in October and November of 2018 \u2014 as apprehensions in general ticked up \u2014 that area's share doubled.\n\nThe majority of that growth in the El Paso area has been from apprehensions of what CBP calls \"family units.\" During those two months, the agency reported that almost three-quarters of all people caught there were traveling with family members.\n\n\"What we've been seeing over the past few months is a dramatic increase in families and kids,\" Andrew Meehan, CBP's assistant commissioner for public affairs, told NPR. \"You have Border Patrol stations that are largely at capacity and are not equipped to handle the large surge of families and kids that have approached our border.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nIt is unclear how many of these migrants applied for asylum after arriving in the U.S. \u2014 but the total number of asylum cases has been increasing as well.\n\n\"A growing percentage of border crossers in recent years have originated in the Northern Triangle states of Central America,\" wrote Robert Warren and Donald Kerwin of the Center for Migration Studies. \"These migrants are fleeing pervasive violence, persecution and poverty, and a large number do not seek to evade arrest, but present themselves to border officials and request political asylum. Many are de facto refugees, not illegal border crossers,\" the authors wrote.\n\nIn 2017, the Border Patrol employed more than 19,000 agents, almost double the number in fiscal 2003. And the agency's budget grew from $263 million in 1990 to more $3.8 billion in 2016, according to the American Immigration Council. The budget for Customs and Border Protection \u2014 which includes the Border Patrol \u2014 has grown from $5.9 billion in 2003 to $13.2 billion in 2016.\n\nAt the same time, apprehensions at the Southern border have declined \u2014 from a high of more than 1.6 million in 2000 to just over 300,000 in 2017.\n\nDoes the wall deter crossings?\n\nDespite consistently high apprehensions in sectors that do contain fencing, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said at the White House on Wednesday that \"everywhere we put up a wall, illegal immigration has been reduced 90 to 95 percent.\"\n\nYet, CBP data shows that the number of people that agents have caught has decreased across the board \u2014 not just in areas where the government constructed barriers.\n\nBoth the El Paso and Rio Grande sectors have physical barriers in place to prevent illegal crossings into the United States. Pedestrian fencing stretches to both sides of the city of El Paso in West Texas, with vehicle barriers along much of the rest of the New Mexico border. In south Texas, pedestrian fencing dots the area around McAllen and expands most of the way from there to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe Tucson sector, which covers most of Arizona and is almost completely blocked by vehicle and pedestrian fencing, has seen a recent increase in apprehensions. In fiscal 2018, CBP caught about 52,000 people there, including an estimated 5,000 unaccompanied minors.\n\nThe sector of the Southwestern border with the fewest apprehensions, on the other hand, has almost no fencing. The Big Bend sector, starting in West Texas and extending about halfway down the state, is the largest individual sector guarded by CBP. The rough terrain of the mountain ranges and the Chihuahuan Desert make it a difficult place to cross. In fiscal 2018, CBP apprehended just 8,000 people there.\n\nJoel Rose contributed to this report."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683302685/report-college-students-are-hungry-and-government-programs-could-do-more-to-help", "text": "Report: College Students Are Hungry And Government Programs Could Do More To Help\n\nEnlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\n\nCollege students across the country struggle with food insecurity.\n\nTuition and books, plus many hours away from a job, can be a huge financial burden on students \u2014 and for many, skipping meals can be a last-minute solution to a bad financial situation.\n\nA new government report finds that millions of college students are very likely struggling. And the report \u2014 which is from the Government Accountability Office \u2014 concludes that the federal systems in place could do a better job of helping them.\n\nThere isn't federal data on food insecurity among college students nationally, so the GAO reviewed 31 studies on the topic, showing that most concluded that over a third of college students don't always have enough to eat.\n\n\"This is a major, major moment and a major victory in the fight against campus hunger,\" Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor at Temple University, said at a briefing Wednesday. The GAO cited her research on food insecurity throughout the report.\n\nGAO's report points out that just 29 percent of college students today are \"traditional students\" \u2014 those who enroll immediately after high school and depend on their parents for financial support. The vast majority \u2014 71 percent \u2014 don't follow the narrative of the \"typical\" college student. They might be financially independent, have kids of their own or fit any one of a number of characteristics that the report lays out.\n\nAnd that's important to remember: While middle-class students may joke about being \"broke college students\" who eat ramen for a week, many students are truly hungry, says Carrie Welton, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy.\n\n\"Low-income students, first-generation students and students of color have a very different experience,\" Welton says.\n\nThe report focuses on ways that the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could better help students struggling with hunger. SNAP \u2014 which operates under the Food and Nutrition Service of the federal government \u2014 provides low-income Americans with assistance for food.\n\nIt's one of the best ways to reduce food insecurity among college students, says Welton. But many students who could be receiving those benefits don't realize it, because the eligibility guidelines are unclear. According to the report, almost 2 million students who may have been eligible for SNAP didn't receive benefits in 2017.\n\n\"It is safe to say that it's confusing and cumbersome, and feels like a very large lift, not only for students to understand it but post-secondary institutions,\" Welton explains.\n\nMany colleges are taking their own steps to address hunger on campus by organizing food pantries and coordinating among staff to identify and work with students who need assistance. But school staff that try to help students access SNAP benefits are often faced with hurdles. At many colleges GAO researchers spoke with, students and school leaders said they were unclear about the SNAP eligibility rules or had incorrect information about them.\n\nEven some staff at state SNAP agencies and regional Food and Nutrition Service offices said that they weren't entirely clear on eligibility rules. The report recommended that the Food and Nutrition Service website clarify SNAP eligibility requirements so that the site can serve as a resource for schools and states.\n\nThe report also recommended that the Food and Nutrition Service review the various approaches that individual state SNAP agencies are taking to help students and share them among the states. These state agencies have some flexibility in how they provide services, and some are taking steps to reach out to college students and clarify eligibility rules.\n\n\"No one gets ahead by letting these numbers go on,\" Goldrick-Rab said Wednesday.\n\nThe federal government invests billions every year in student financial aid \u2014 but many students who receive those funds don't make it through college. As the GAO report notes, access to SNAP benefits has been shown to increase the likelihood that those students will graduate with a degree."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/01/09/683055963/democrats-health-care-ambitions-meet-the-reality-of-divided-government", "text": "Democrats' Health Care Ambitions Meet The Reality Of Divided Government\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nIn her first speech as speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi made it clear that she knows that health care is key to why voters sent Democrats to Congress.\n\n\"In the past two years the American people have spoken,\" Pelosi told members of Congress and their families who were gathered Thursday in the House chamber for the opening day of the session.\n\n\"Tens of thousands of public events were held, hundreds of thousands of people turned out, millions of calls were made, countless families, even sick little children \u2014 our little lobbyists, our little lobbyists \u2014 bravely came forward to tell their stories and they made a big difference,\" said Pelosi, a California Democrat.\n\nWhat is the Democrats' mandate?\n\n\"To lower health care costs and prescription drug prices and protect people with pre-existing medical conditions,\" she said to applause.\n\nIn their campaigns last year, Democrats promised to protect the Affordable Care Act, and the access to coverage that it guarantees for many people. Many Democrats went further, running on the promise of \"Medicare-for-all.\"\n\nBut now that Democrats control the House, their ambitions are meeting up with reality.\n\nWith the Senate in Republican hands and President Trump having promised to repeal the ACA, Democrats' ability to make sweeping health policy changes is limited.\n\nInstead, they'll likely rely on hearings and turn to the courts to try to influence health policy and shore up the ACA.\n\nPelosi started on Day 1.\n\nJust hours after her speech, House Democrats voted to intervene in a lawsuit in an effort to protect the Affordable Care Act. The House will join several state attorneys general in appealing the ruling of a federal district judge in Texas that the law is unconstitutional.\n\nAnd Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., head of the Energy and Commerce Committee, announced a hearing on the impact of the ruling. He said he intends to hold lots of hearings to review the Trump administration's actions around the ACA \u2014 actions he calls \"sabotage.\"\n\n\"At a time when the Trump administration is doing all the sabotage of the ACA, I think the focus really has to be on trying to prevent the sabotage and making sure the ACA is strengthened,\" he said in an interview in his Capitol Hill office.\n\nThat \"sabotage\" includes Trump's decision to stop reimbursing insurance companies for discounts they're required by law to give to their lowest-income clients, Pallone said.\n\nHe also cited a Department of Health and Human Services rule change that allows insurance policies that don't carry the full benefits required by the ACA to be renewed for up to three years. In the past, those plans were intended to serve as a bridge for someone between jobs and were limited to just a few months\n\nPallone said these and other changes may violate the law.\n\n\"I think if you do some good oversight and find out what the sabotage consists of, then you can say, 'Well this isn't allowed under the law,' \" Pallone said. \"And then you either take it to court or try to get legislation passed.\"\n\nOversight is a powerful tool, said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, a former HHS official who is now a managing director at Manatt Health Strategies, a consulting firm.\n\n\"I don't think we should underestimate how important that is, when decisions that are being made are questioned and officials have to defend them,\" she said.\n\nFor the past two years, the focus in Washington has been on repealing or dismantling the Affordable Care Act. That's about to change, she said.\n\n\"That energy can now shift to examining what the administration is doing and putting forth other ideas and other proposals, some of which might generate bipartisan agreement,\" she said.\n\nPallone is hopeful that Republicans may support some measure to shore up the ACA. In the last Congress, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., proposed bills that would restore those payments to insurers, and he backed a plan to create a reinsurance program that could help reduce premiums.\n\nPallone acknowledged Democrats' plans are much less ambitious than the \"Medicare-for-all\" proposals that many of his colleagues touted during their campaigns.\n\n\"I just think it's unlikely that we could ever pass it,\" he said. \"So I don't want to prioritize that.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/682925400/as-shutdown-crawls-on-artists-and-nonprofits-fear-for-their-fragile-industry", "text": "As Shutdown Crawls On, Artists And Nonprofits Fear For Their 'Fragile Industry'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nUpdated at 8:15 a.m. ET Thursday\n\nJill Rorem, like many Americans, had made some special plans for the holidays. The Chicago native, whose legal work often brings her to Washington, D.C., was finally going to get to see the nation's capital with her arts-obsessed kids.\n\n\"I have very nerdy daughters, and they're super cool. Like, my oldest kid was Andy Warhol for Halloween,\" Rorem says. So they'd planned a grand tour of the city's museums, from the National Gallery of Art to the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, maybe even the zoo if she could convince her husband. \"They would have soaked it up. I always love watching things from my kids' eyes.\"\n\nThen, the federal government partially shut down.\n\nInstead of heading to D.C., where all their dream destinations were shuttered without funding, her family lost about a thousand dollars rescheduling the trip.\n\nNow, Rorem readily concedes that her family's frustrations are far from the worst of the shutdown's fallout \u2014 but she's also far from alone. The showdown in Washington has reverberated across a vast expanse of the U.S. arts community and beyond the country's borders. It has been felt not just by the museums and their patrons, but also by Brooklyn students, Los Angeles filmmakers, domestic nonprofits and foreign artists \u2014 even among the volcanoes of Hawaii.\n\n\"It's a fragile industry. It's not a rich, money-making thing,\" Robert Lynch, head of Americans for the Arts, says of the landscape of arts workers and organizations.\n\n\"So any little crack \u2014 whether it is the elimination of money from the National Endowment for the Arts or the slowing of it down, like a shutdown does \u2014 it potentially affects people and their planning and their ability to attract other funders, all of that kind of thing. It's a ripple effect.\"\n\nThe great range of those ripples\n\nThere are about 100,000 nonprofit arts organizations across the country, according to Lynch, and when it comes to funding, \"many of them end the year just on the edge.\"\n\nSo the NEA and its sister agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities, often represent a critical boon to many of these groups. Both agencies reach thousands of small and large organizations around the country, including NPR. And getting a grant from the NEA or NEH helps those groups to raise funds from other sources, in turn.\n\nOn its website, the NEA says it will honor all of its Fiscal Year 2019 grants and that it's accepting applications for 2020, but during the shutdown there's nobody working at either agency to answer questions.\n\nThis has left many of the groups that rely on them feeling stymied and skittish.\n\n\"Because federal grants are done on a reimbursement basis, we don't have the money in hand,\" says Dorothy Ryan, managing director of Theatre for a New Audience, a theater company based in Brooklyn.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gerry Goodstein/Courtesy of Theatre for a New Audience Gerry Goodstein/Courtesy of Theatre for a New Audience\n\nFor more than a decade they've been taking Shakespeare to some of New York's poorest schools through a program partly funded by the NEA. This spring they're planning to introduce students to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, and though they've been awarded a $25,000 grant from the NEA, Ryan worries about when they'll actually receive it.\n\n\"As you can imagine, any nonprofit cultural organization struggles with cash flow, as they really need to expend funds before funds are received,\" she says. \"And the question about when the National Endowment for the Arts will be distributing funds really hits home for us.\"\n\nIt has also hit home thousands of miles away in Hawaii, where Glenn McClure is feeling the pain of the shutdown in quite another way. The composer, who draws his musical ideas from nature, received a $2,000 stipend and housing from the National Parks Art Foundation to produce work inspired by the Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island.\n\nSo McClure is facing a double whammy: Not only is the source of his funding affected by the shutdown, so is his temporary workplace. Since the shutdown shuttered the park, he has had to cancel a scheduled concert and lecture, and he can't get into the park to carry on his research.\n\nListen to one of McClure's previous works \"Cry,\" performed by Madrigalia 4:07\n\nSuch concerns are not confined to Hawaii either. On the mainland, the closure of federal lands has also barred filmmakers from using some popular shooting locations, such as the Angeles National Forest near Los Angeles. The region's official film office, FilmLA, says it has already had to redirect about half a dozen prospective productions because of it.\n\nThat doesn't just cause headaches for the filmmakers; it costs local authorities thousands of dollars in permit fees and potentially discourages other projects in the area.\n\n\"California and Los Angeles have worked very hard to return the film industry back to the region after years of poaching by states and countries that have offered money for the industry to leave,\" says FilmLA President Paul Audley.\n\n\"Every time we have a situation where the industry has to look elsewhere, it can become habitual to go away. And so our concern is that over a duration of time that this could have an impact on the level of production in our region.\"\n\n\"What we do, when do we pull the plug?\"\n\nComplexity and frustration is nothing new to Brian Goldstein. The entertainment attorney with Goldstein & Guilliams has spent some two decades navigating the often Byzantine twists and turns of the U.S. visa process for his firm's international clients, mostly in classical, jazz and world music.\n\n\"People, I think, just assume the arts show up,\" he explains. \"And I don't really think they know what's happening to get these things \u2014 you know, domestically, let alone when it involves international performances.\"\n\nBut he says the shutdown has only compounded those complications.\n\n\"We already have the venues calling our office every day: 'What's going to happen? What we do, when do we pull the plug?' \" Goldstein says. \"And I have nothing to tell them, because everybody is just hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute on hold.\"\n\nFor now, visa and passport services remain open, according to a State Department spokesperson, \"as long as there are sufficient fees to support operations.\"\n\nStill, he says such assurances have offered cold comfort to his clients and the venues booking them, who fear the prospect of delayed operations derailing their headline acts weeks and months down the road.\n\n\"You know, it's show business \u2014 it's already fraught with risk and danger,\" Goldstein says. \"And this is one more complete unpredictable process that could blow up at any moment.\"\n\nCrystal balls and cherry blossoms\n\nOf course, the shutdown also complicated matters for Jill Rorem, the mother who rescheduled her family trip to Washington, D.C. And though she did go ahead and book new tickets for the trip in April, she's careful to say that doesn't mean she's making any predictions.\n\n\"Honestly, who knows if the shutdown will still be there,\" she says. \"But we decided that the cherry blossoms would be there, and we could at least walk around comfortably outside.\"\n\nGlenn McClure, the composer working in Hawaii, is seeking solace in nature, too \u2014 albeit in a slightly different way.\n\n\"It's frustrating to not be able to do work at the level that I had anticipated,\" McClure says. \"But I think above and beyond that, it's so important for these parks to be open, because it helps teach everyone how important the natural world is to our human life on the planet.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683642605/how-is-the-shutdown-affecting-america-let-us-count-the-ways", "text": "How Is The Shutdown Affecting America?

The shutdown, driven by a political battle over President Trump's demand that Congress approve funds for a wall along the border with Mexico, is touching the lives of Americans in myriad ways.\n\nNine federal departments (and some smaller agencies like NASA) are affected, at least in part, by the lapse in funding: Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, State, Transportation and the Treasury. Approximately 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or are being required to work without pay.\n\nCongress had already passed appropriations bills funding about three-quarters of the federal government, including Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, so those departments and agencies remain operational.\n\nLots of important things are not affected by this shutdown: Medicare, Medicaid, and the Health Insurance Marketplace (aka Obamacare). Social Security, disability checks and veterans' benefits. Getting a passport. And the U.S. Postal Service, an independent agency whose operations are funded by sales of postage and services, not taxes, keeps delivering mail.\n\nBut other aspects of American life have become complicated, scarce or messy since the shutdown started. Here's a look at how it's affecting the country.\n\nAir safety\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Many of its workers are considered \"essential,\" so many are working without pay \u2014 though a greater number than usual have been calling in sick. So far, lines at airport security have not been significantly longer.\n\nTSA employees are among the lowest-paid federal workers.\n\n\"If there's no check on the 26th, I have no idea what we're going to do,\" 36-year-old Jacinda, whose husband is a TSA officer in Portland, told NPR. \"Our rent is due, the electric bill is due, our cellphones are now past due. ... I'm scared and I'm trying to be OK because I can't be sad every day for my kids, and I can't be stressed out because it affects how I parent.\" She said her husband is stressed out too \u2014 and that he has been given instructions on how to file for unemployment, though he's still working 40 hours a week.\n\nAlso affected: air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid.\n\n\"It's a very high-stress job and you need to be on your game at all times,\" says Mick Devine of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. \"There is a concern that as this goes on, the human factors aspect of this shutdown will take a toll on the psyche and concentration level of our members.\"\n\nMany planes are not being inspected and pilot training is not being certified, says Capt. Dennis Tajer, a pilot for American Airlines and a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association.\n\nThat's because many of the FAA safety inspectors aren't working.\n\n\"We are able to maintain a margin of safety and security, but every day another player is pulled off the field and it comes some point where the game cannot be played properly,\" Tajer told NPR.\n\n\"We are another layer of safety,\" inspector Troy Tomey told the Miami Herald. \"We're the last check of the box. Taking us out of it, mistakes can happen.\"\n\nFood inspection\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration furloughed about 40 percent of its staff since the government shutdown. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that the agency has suspended all routine inspections of food processing facilities in the U.S., The Washington Post reports. He said he hopes to be able to bring inspectors to high-risk facilities as early as next week.\n\n\"That puts our food supply at risk,\" Sarah Sorscher with the Center for Science in the Public Interest says in a statement. \"Regular inspections, which help stop foodborne illness before people get sick, are vital.\"\n\nFood stamps\n\nThe Department of Agriculture has announced it will continue to fund SNAP (food stamps) through February. The USDA says it can keep paying SNAP benefits up to 30 days beyond the expiration of the most recent government funding resolution. That means SNAP recipients will actually get their February benefits early, on or before that spending authority expires on Jan. 20. About 1 in 10 Americans relies at least partly on SNAP benefits to buy food.\n\nThe USDA's other major nutrition assistance programs have enough funding to continue operations into February.\n\nScientific research\n\nClimate scientists from all over the world are meeting in Vancouver this month, as the lead authors of the next international climate science report. But at least seven U.S. climate scientists who were supposed to help write it aren't there \u2014 scientists for NOAA, NASA and other federal agencies can't work or travel for work because of the shutdown.\n\nAir-quality monitoring is also affected: The Environmental Protection Agency manages sensors all over the country that detect various kinds of air pollution, such as ozone, industrial chemicals and smog. Usually, this data is released to the public right away, but because the EPA isn't operating at full strength, that's not happening. Air sensors run by state agencies and private institutions are still working, however.\n\nCoast Guard\n\nWhile the other branches of the military are part of the Defense Department, the Coast Guard falls under Homeland Security. After some maneuvering, the government found a way to pay its military members on Dec. 31. The nearly 42,000 active duty members of the Coast Guard are still working, as they are considered essential personnel, but it's not clear whether they will get a paycheck on Jan. 15.\n\nFormer Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen described a wide range of operations that continue during the shutdown: search and rescues along the nation's coastlines, efforts to stop drug smugglers, even the piloting of an icebreaker to Antarctica to break the ice around McMurdo Station.\n\n\"I think it's pretty bad,\" Allen told NPR. \"I think when you have people providing emergency services to this country without pay, I think we ought to take a serious look at how we're governed.\"\n\nNative American communities\n\nThe shutdown has meant that 2,295 of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' 4,057 employees are subject to furlough. Phone calls to the bureau go unanswered.\n\nThe Indian Health Service, which is funded by Interior, provides health services for approximately 2.2 million of the nation's estimated 3.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. Most of its funds are appropriated for Native Americans who live on or near reservations in the western U.S., though some funding goes to those who live in urban areas.\n\nAnd the IHS is being hit especially hard by the lapse in funding. As NPR has reported, its only services that can continue are those that meet \"immediate needs of the patients, medical staff, and medical facilities.\"\n\nIHS clinics are open during the shutdown and many staffers are reporting for work because they're considered essential, but they aren't being paid. Grants to support tribal health programs and preventive health clinics are currently suspended.\n\nImmigration courts and enforcement\n\nThe country's immigration courts are closed, and they already had a huge backlog even before the shutdown. Member station KPCC/LAist reported last month that Los Angeles alone had fewer than 40 judges and nearly 74,000 pending cases.\n\nWith the courts now closed, the people who were due in court have their cases moved to the back of the line and must have them rescheduled, which could add two or three years to their wait.\n\n\"It's not like when we come back, we can absorb the cases,\" Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told KPCC/LAist. \"There's no magical way to tell thousands of people to just come to their court hearings two weeks later so that the ones that were not heard can be heard.\"\n\nThe shutdown has also halted E-Verify, a federal program that aims to prevent immigrants from working in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"There's an irony there,\" Julie Pace, an attorney specializing in employment and immigration law at the Cavanagh Law Firm in Phoenix, told NPR. \"We have an electronic wall for E-Verify that should be being used, that the government has not funded.\"\n\nFederal courts\n\nThe federal judiciary continues to operate during the shutdown, using court fee balances and other funds. Its employees are reporting to work and remain fully paid, and it estimates it has enough money to sustain paid operations until Jan. 18.\n\nIf the funds run out before new appropriations are received, \"essential work\" in the federal courts will continue. \"Each court would determine the staff necessary to support its mission critical work,\" the judiciary said in a statement on Jan. 7. \"In response to requests by the Department of Justice, some federal courts have issued orders suspending, postponing, or holding in abeyance civil cases in which the government is a party for a limited period, subject to further consideration, or until appropriated funds become available.\"\n\nCriminal cases are expected to continue without interruption.\n\nThe arts\n\nAfter staying open for the first few days of the shutdown, the museums and institutions that make up the Smithsonian have all closed.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts says it will honor its fiscal year 2019 grants and that it's currently accepting applications for 2020, though during the shutdown, nobody is working at the agency to answer any questions.\n\nAnd some arts organizations receive federal grants on a reimbursement basis, which means they aren't sure when they will get back the money they paid upfront.\n\n\"As you can imagine, any nonprofit cultural organization struggles with cash flow, as they really need to expend funds before funds are received,\" Dorothy Ryan, managing director of Brooklyn theater company Theatre for a New Audience, told NPR. \"And the question about when the National Endowment for the Arts will be distributing funds really hits home for us.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nNational parks\n\nMany national parks have stayed open through the shutdown, though without staff or servicing. While in some places other parties have stepped in to help \u2014 state or local governments, tourist bureaus, or volunteer groups \u2014 not all is well.\n\nTwo weeks into the shutdown, NPS announced it will dip into entrance fee funds to pay for staff and service at some parks \u2014 an unprecedented and controversial move, as entrance fees are earmarked for visitor services, not operations and basic maintenance.\n\nAt California's Joshua Tree National Park, which has stayed open without rangers, visitors drove off-road through parkland, creating new, unsanctioned roads, and destroyed some of the park's Joshua trees. After first saying the park would close on Jan. 10, the NPS reversed course and announced that by using fee revenue, Joshua Tree will remain open with additional staff to deal with sanitation issues and protection of park resources.\n\nFormer NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis believes the national parks have been kept open to avoid the public outcry that occurred over their closure during the 2013 shutdown. In an opinion piece for The Guardian, he warns of an array of ugly consequences of leaving the parks open: human waste in waterways, overflowing trash attracting wildlife and increasing human/bear encounters, poaching, artifact theft, and damage to fragile natural features.\n\nOne site where you can find NPS rangers during the shutdown? The tower of the Old Post Office \u2013 the building leased to the Trump International Hotel. The building is owned by the General Services Administration. As NPR reports, the rangers were furloughed when the shutdown began. But then the GSA found some money to pay their salary, and the rangers returned.\n\nRep. Betty McCollum, incoming chair of a House subcommittee that oversees the NPS, told NPR that she has a lot of questions about the arrangement: \"The fact that it's a short-term agreement, the fact that it was a scramble to do it during a government shutdown, just has all the makings of, you know, why did this happen? Is it legal? Is it ethical?\"\n\nOil and gas drilling\n\nThe oil and gas business is booming, but much of that drilling is on federal lands and operators worry about a slowdown, Cooper McKim of Wyoming Public Media reports. The Bureau of Land Management says it is still processing online applications to drill; however, it's not clear what's actually happening with those.\n\n\"Companies are waiting for leases,\" said Kathleen Sgamma of the Western Energy Alliance, a group of oil and gas companies. \"If you don't have the full lease hold, it's hard to do the exploratory work or full development work you're planning on.\"\n\nThat could be significant in Wyoming, where taxes from oil and gas make up a third of state revenue. More oil and gas lease sales are slated for February and March, but some in the industry worry that if the shutdown drags on, they won't happen.\n\nOne place the shutdown isn't slowing proposed drilling projects is Alaska. BLM is moving ahead with holding public meetings about oil and gas drilling leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska Public Media reports. The bureau is part of Interior, one of the departments affected by the shutdown.\n\nRa\u00fal Grijalva, the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, wrote a letter to the acting secretary of the Interior, asking how these hearings are happening \"while so many other essential services remain shut down.\"\n\nBLM told Alaska Public Media that it's using funds from the previous fiscal year to continue working.\n\nThe District of Columbia\n\nWashington, D.C.'s courts are funded through the federal government, and its marriage bureau has been shuttered, leaving some engaged couples in the lurch. So the D.C. Council just passed the LOVE Act (Let Our Vows Endure Emergency Amendment Act of 2019) to give D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser the authority to grant marriage licenses during the shutdown. (As member station WAMU/DCist notes, divorces and trials have continued.)\n\nThe federal government is also the largest customer of DC Water \u2014 and it told the utility company it wouldn't be paying $5 million of its quarterly bill during the shutdown, WAMU's Jacob Fenston reports. The DC Water board members joked about how to handle this big unpaid bill, perhaps by turning off the water at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\n\"Water is leverage,\" says DC Water spokesperson Vincent Morris. \"No one wants to go without it.\"\n\nColin Dwyer, Elizabeth Blair, Greg Myre, David Schaper, Rhitu Chatterjee, Philip Ewing, Dan Charles, Joel Rose, Rebecca Hersher, Cooper McKim, Ian Stewart, Marisa Pe\u00f1aloza, Peter Overby, and Shefali Luthra contributed to this report."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683501433/father-and-son-who-are-african-americans-discuss-racism-in-youth-hockey", "text": "Team Rallies Around Black Hockey Player After He Receives Racist Taunts\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Divyne Apollon Sr. Courtesy of Divyne Apollon Sr.\n\nDivyne Apollon II, a 13-year-old African-American hockey player, was playing in a recent tournament in Maryland when the opposing team hurled racist insults. While Divyne and his father \u2014 who was at the tournament \u2014 have seen this behavior at rinks before, they were both stunned when his teammates came to his defense.\n\n\"It made me feel appreciated, like I actually was supposed to be there, and that somebody that wasn't just my dad or my family members actually cared,\" Divyne tells NPR's Noel King.\n\nDivyne, who has been playing hockey for five years, says he has experienced racist taunts on the ice multiple times. However, it has never been as extreme as this past tournament, where the other team called him the N-word and chanted for him to get off the ice and go play basketball.\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post's Petula Dvorak on Jan. 3:\n\n\"The game Saturday was buzzing with racial animosity. The monkey sounds were constant when the players were in Divyne's zone. And he tried to ignore them. \" 'Normally, stuff like that doesn't happen directly to my face,' said Divyne, who is in eighth grade at Fusion Academy. 'But it was there.' \"He kept looking at the other coach, the refs. They did nothing. Maybe they couldn't hear. But his teammates heard, and they were furious. The game got rough. \"At the end of the third period, the fed-up teammates started yelling at the other team and a fight began. Divyne said he got punched in the face, and he fought back.\"\n\nThe subsequent brawl caused Divyne, who plays defense for the Odenton., Md., Metro Maple Leafs, to be ejected from the game.\n\n\"I knew when he fell in love with hockey that this would be part of the experience, unfortunately,\" his father, Divyne Apollon Sr., tells King.\n\nHe says his advice to his son was to focus on playing hockey. \"You don't deal with the refs; you don't deal with the coaches \u2014 that's my department,\" he says. \"I transfer that also into police, teachers, adults. That's not your realm to deal with, that's for me to deal with.\"\n\nDivyne says he usually does brush off the jeers. \"I realized if I was to retaliate or hit the kid or something, I'd end up getting penalized again, so I just brushed it off.\" That is, until his teammates stood up for him and he defended himself in the uproar that followed.\n\nThe parents of Divyne's teammates had no idea that he \u2014 and his father \u2014 had been increasingly experiencing similar racist sentiments at games for the past few years.\n\n\"I've had people ignore me at other rinks who work there, they will brush me off, and you kind of know the telltale signs that 'OK, we aren't wanted here,' and you kind of keep moving on and find other ways to deal with things so it doesn't get to a point where I'm the 'angry black guy,' \" Apollon says.\n\nDivyne had a different take on the surprise of the other parents.\n\n\"I just thought it was funny because they didn't know it was something that happens, even though it happens to me pretty often,\" he says.\n\nDivyne's experience has sparked professional hockey players to voice encouragement.\n\nMoved by the support of Divyne's teammates, two players from the Washington Capitals invited the Metro Maple Leafs to an NHL game on Jan. 14.\n\nAnd P.K. Subban, a high-profile black NHL player, has been similarly driven to respond to young black hockey players who have recently faced racism on the ice. Subban and his father have encouraged them to keep playing hockey, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDespite the recent events, Divyne doesn't want to give up the sport. \"I enjoy it too much and put too much time and effort into it to give up on it,\" he says.\n\nEmma Talkoff and William Jones produced and edited this story for broadcast.\n\nLindsey Feingold is the NPR Digital Content intern."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/08/683365340/joshua-tree-national-park-will-close-after-visitor-damage-during-government-shut", "text": "Joshua Tree National Park Will Remain Accessible During Government Shutdown\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 5 p.m. ET on Thursday\n\nJoshua Tree National Park will remain accessible to visitors during the partial government shutdown despite an announcement earlier this week that the park would be closed as of Thursday morning.\n\n\"By immediately utilizing revenue generated by recreation fees, National Park Service officials have been able to avert a temporary closure of Joshua Tree National Park that had been previously scheduled for January 10,\" park officials said in a statement. \"In addition, recently closed areas of the park will once again be accessible to visitors starting January 10.

Even though SMAP broke up, its influence is still being felt.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nThe lineup for this summer's Coachella festival is making fans of K-pop and J-pop smile. Korean and Japanese pop music groups feature prominently. Many people have heard about K-pop, the Korean boy band BTS. They topped the U.S. charts last summer. Many fewer people know the blueprints for the genre mostly came from Japan. A group there called SMAP played a big role in shaping the pop idol landscape across Asia. SMAP broke up but remains a huge influence. Naomi Gingold reports.\n\nNAOMI GINGOLD, BYLINE: This has to start with a bit of a confession. I'm kind of a Japanese teeny-bopper. When I was 16, living in the Japanese countryside as an exchange student, I fell in love with the boy band SMAP. And like most of Japan, I never fell out of love with them.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"YOZORA NO MUKOU\")\n\nSMAP: (Singing in Japanese).\n\nGINGOLD: SMAP, Sports Music Assemble People, debuted in 1991. They came from Johnny's Entertainment, this male pop idol factory in Japan. But unlike most Johnny's groups, when SMAP came out, they were kind of a flop.\n\nRYOKO OSANAI: (Speaking Japanese).\n\nGINGOLD: So SMAP's manager took a new approach, says Ryoko Osanai, a reporter who's covered SMAP extensively.\n\nOSANAI: (Through interpreter) She started putting SMAP on comedy variety shows. It was a first for pop idols, and it was really popular.\n\nGINGOLD: Now, to anyone familiar with pop groups in Asia now, this seems typical. But in the '90s, pop idols were too cool for this. SMAP's popularity on these shows, though, changed the game for everybody.\n\nOSANAI: (Through interpreter) After SMAP, idols all started being on variety shows. They had to be able to do comedy, act, sing, dance.\n\nGINGOLD: In the mid-'90s, SMAP upped the ante again.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA LA LA LOVE SONG\")\n\nTOSHINOBU KUBOTA: (Singing in Japanese).\n\nGINGOLD: One member, Takuya Kimura, starred in a TV drama called \"Long Vacation\" that exploded in Japan and across Asia. Overnight, he became Japan's No. 1 star, and the show's success cemented the superstar acting careers of all group five members.\n\nFABIENNE DARLING-WOLF: \"Long Vacation\" really kind of sparked a wave of Japanese transcultural influence, and SMAP became associated with that wave.\n\nGINGOLD: Fabienne Darling-Wolf is a professor of global media at Temple University in Philadelphia. Today, we talk about the Korean wave. But back then, it was the Japanese wave.\n\nDARLING-WOLF: Before K-pop, there was J-pop. (Laughter) I mean, it's a format, right? And the format was developed in Japan.\n\nGINGOLD: How agencies are run, what activities idols do. The same year as \"Long Vacation\" debuted, SMAP got their own TV variety show on Monday nights. Now, the truth is they weren't particularly good singers or even dancers. But they did have big hits.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SMAP SONG, \"SEKAI NI HITOTSU DAKE NO HANA\")\n\nGINGOLD: And this song became particularly important. It's called \"One And Only Flower In The World.\" The lyrics basically say you are the only one of you. You are special. It's OK to be you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SEKAI NI HITOTSU DAKE NO HANA\")\n\nSMAP: (Singing in Japanese).\n\nGINGOLD: It was a megahit and later kind of became a rallying cry of Japanese pride. So in 2016, when rumors started that SMAP might be splitting up after 25 years, it created this earthquake of tabloid gossip and fan pandemonium. Then, one Monday night, SMAP came on their show in black suits, bowed deeply and apologized...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SMAPXSMAP\")\n\nUNIDENTIFIED SMAP MEMBER: (Speaking Japanese).\n\nGINGOLD: ...And said they were continuing. Twitter crashed in Japan. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he was glad the group was staying together. Then, half a year later, SMAP said they would be calling it quits. Fans took out full-page newspaper ads, signed online petitions. And today, they still call for them to return because although individual SMAP members are still active, something in Japan is missing.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LION HEART\")\n\nSMAP: (Singing in Japanese).\n\nGINGOLD: The institution of SMAP may not be there, but the way they helped shape Japanese and Asian pop culture writ large is everywhere. And because this is my story, we're going out on my favorite song, \"Lion Heart.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LION HEART\")\n\nSMAP: (Singing in Japanese).\n\nGINGOLD: For NPR News, I'm Naomi Gingold in Tokyo.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LION HEART\")\n\nSMAP: (Singing in Japanese).\n\nCORNISH: And this story came to us from the podcast Not The Hello Kitty Show.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LION HEART\")\n\nSMAP: (Singing in Japanese).\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

The only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government,\" the president said.\n\nTrump's address Tuesday night seemed, at least in part, a way to reassure nervous Republicans about the political cost of the shutdown, some of whom may be wavering as more impacts from the partial closure of the government ripple across the country. Trump and Vice President Pence will meet with Senate Republicans on Wednesday, and on Thursday Trump will visit the border to continue his media blitz. But in the nearly three-week-long shutdown, there still is no clear path to a resolution anytime soon, as both Trump and Democratic congressional leaders in their rebuttal offered nothing new beyond the arguments they've been making since last month.\n\nUnlike at his campaign rallies, Trump didn't begin his Oval Office address with his push for a wall. Instead, he first outlined what he says is an urgent need to address a growing number of migrants trying to cross the border and to address drugs coming across illegally.\n\n\"Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States \u2014 a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also claimed that the \"Southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs\" and that it was necessary to \"stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers.\"\n\nHowever, an NPR fact check found that according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs come through legal ports of entry and only a small fraction comes through parts of the Southern border that would be impacted by a wall.\n\nTrump also tried to make an emotional plea, pointing as he often has to crimes and slayings committed by undocumented immigrants as another reason stricter border security is necessary.\n\n\"How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?\" Trump asked, framing his argument as \"a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.\"\n\nHowever, studies show undocumented immigrants in the U.S. commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans.\n\nThe Trump administration has tried to establish a link between terrorism and the situation at the Southern border, and on Tuesday night Trump said a \"barrier is absolutely critical to national security.\" But he and his allies have often exaggerated the threat or simply used inaccurate or misleading statistics to do so. While there has been a spike in Southern border crossings in the past few months \u2014 largely children and families fleeing violence in Central America \u2014 overall illegal crossings are lower than in either 2016 or 2014 and far lower than their peak around 2000.\n\nTrump also tried to make the argument that the wall would be paid for, indirectly, by Mexico thanks to a new trade deal he has negotiated to replace NAFTA. However, that new deal has not been ratified by Congress, and as NPR's Tamara Keith has reported, there's no guarantee the economic gains could pay for the wall and the White House has not explained its math to back up that claim.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders also claimed last week that Customs and Border Protection picked up almost 4,000 suspected terrorists along the Southern border, but NBC News found those stops have largely been made at airports. During the first half of fiscal year 2018, CBP stopped just six immigrants at ports of entry on the Southern border who were on a federal terrorist watchlist, NBC also found.\n\nTrump asked for more funding for \"cutting age technology,\" more Border Patrol agents (who are currently working but not being paid since the Department of Homeland Security is subject to the partial shutdown) and for more immigration judges.\n\nThe president also claimed that \"at the request of Democrats\" any wall would be a steel barrier. However, that has not been a condition from Democrats. Rather, after long pushing for a concrete wall, Trump recently shifted to talking about using steel slats to build a barrier on the Southern border, hoping that might convince some Democrats, but it has not.\n\nDemocrats have remained in staunch opposition to any contingencies on reopening the government, arguing their victories in the midterm elections and public polling have shown the country doesn't want a wall. In their response following Trump's address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Trump of trying to \"manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\"\n\n\"The fact is: President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation \u2014 many of them veterans,\" Pelosi said. \"He promised to keep government shut down for 'months or years' \u2014 no matter whom it hurts. That's just plain wrong.\"\n\nPelosi also pushed back on Trump's claims, saying that \"the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge \u2014 a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened.\"\n\nWatch The Democratic Response\n\nTrump has said he won't sign any bill to reopen the government, about a quarter of which was shuttered on Dec. 22, unless Congress acquiesces to his request for $5.7 billion to build the wall \u2014 Trump's central campaign promise that received raucous applause at his rallies, albeit with the caveat that Mexico would pay for the barrier. Last month, Trump said he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government over border security and would gladly \"take the mantle.\" However, since the partial shutdown became a reality, he has tried to shift the blame to Democrats.\n\nTuesday night Schumer challenged Trump to reopen the government while continuing to negotiate on border security.\n\n\"We can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements about policy,\" the Senate minority leader said. \"We can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.\"\n\nLast week, House Democrats passed legislation to reopen the government, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the Senate won't take it up \u2014 even though the Senate passed identical legislation last month before Trump reasserted his desire for billions in funding for a border wall.\n\nIn a statement after the address, McConnell remained firmly behind Trump and sought to foist blame back on Democrats.\n\n\"The past eighteen days have shown that Democrats' refusal to negotiate is not due to any principled objection, but simply due to partisan spite for the president,\" the Senate majority leader said. \"For the men and women of the Border Patrol, for the safety of American families, and for all Americans who deserve a fully operational federal government, I sincerely hope my Democratic colleagues will come to the table and help deliver a solution.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2018/12/22/679546929/working-the-holidays-as-an-amazon-worker", "text": "Working The Holidays As An Amazon Worker\n\nNPR's Michel Martin talks to Vox business reporter Chavie Lieber about what it's like to work in an Amazon warehouse during the holidays.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIt's just a couple of more days until Christmas. And if you are like other last-minute shoppers, you may be wondering how on earth you're going to get those last gifts on time. And if you just cannot stand the thought of a crowded shopping mall - and, frankly, even if you can - you're probably thinking about turning to Amazon. Amazon is now the 800-pound gorilla of e-commerce, accounting for some 60 percent of purchases on Black Friday, according to the web traffic analyst Hitwise. And, yes, it is an NPR sponsor.\n\nBut we were wondering what it's like to work at an Amazon warehouse during the holidays, so we called Chavie Lieber. She's written extensively about working conditions at Amazon for Vox, and she's with us now. Chavie, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nCHAVIE LIEBER: Hi. Thanks for having me. Great to be here.\n\nMARTIN: How much does the workload increase at Amazon during what they call peak, between Thanksgiving and just after Christmas? Can you give us a sense of that? And tell us - as we said, you have sources who speak to you usually without attribution. But what are they telling you about what that's like?\n\nLIEBER: A lot of the Amazon warehouse workers that reached out to me, they all say that they are grateful for the job. They want the job. It's really just that it is high-intensity. It is so aggressive. All Amazon warehouses abide by this number called a packing quota. And basically, what that means is every Amazon warehouse worker has a number of boxes that they have to pack per hour. And during the holiday season, when the orders are kind of running in, the managers are trying to get the warehouse workers to pack faster and faster.\n\nSo, you know, the average can be, let's say, 240. But then, during the holiday season, the number of boxes you have to pack per hour can go as high as 400. And basically, if you are slowing down, you're not keeping up or your productivity levels aren't as high, workers can get write-ups, and they can also be terminated.\n\nSo it just seems like, you know, working under these type of conditions is pretty demeaning. And some employees that I've talked to have said, you know, by the end of the holiday season, a lot of people just feel like they can't make it.\n\nMARTIN: Well, first of all, why do you say it's demeaning? I mean, I can see that it's demanding. But why do you say it's demeaning? Do they say it's demeaning?\n\nLIEBER: Yeah. Yeah. The line that a lot of people say to me when they talk about, you know, people that are protesting and they're rallying against Amazon, they want Jeff Bezos and they want Amazon to know that we are not robots.\n\nAnd basically, it's this idea that, you know, they want to do the work load. And they want to pack for Amazon. And they want to do this job. But they don't want to work in this type of environment. And basically, Amazon has this really codified system where it's not like you can talk to a manager and explain, you know, I'm not feeling well this day or I'm doing this. Like, you know, people describe it as like a well-oiled machine.\n\nMARTIN: So I was going to ask you about that. Are there rules about breaks - how long, how often people are allowed to have them?\n\nLIEBER: I will tell you what I know about people that are working there full-time, which is, according to federal law, you need to have breaks. And Amazon's break system is two 15-minute breaks and then a half-hour lunch break. And, you know, some of the complaints that Amazon workers have told me is that these breaks are definitely not enough, especially if some - you know, some of the Amazon warehouse workers in Minneapolis are protesting because a lot of them are Muslim. And they don't have enough breaks to, you know, eat, drink, get water, go to the bathroom, grab lunch and then also abide by their praying schedule.\n\nSo even though, you know, the 30-minute break and then the 15 - and the 15-minute break add up to an hour, which I guess is pretty typical in a lot of workplaces where people are given an hour lunch break, it's extremely rigid. And if you go over your break time, like, you can get penalized.\n\nMARTIN: What about overtime? Are people expected to work overtime? Are they required to work overtime during peak?\n\nLIEBER: Yeah. During peak season, according to my understanding, overtime is mandatory. Some of the people have told me that their schedules are something like four days a week, 12-hour shifts. And if you try to use vacation time or paid time to call out during peak time, it can be a fireable offense, or it could - it could get you penalized.\n\nMARTIN: If you don't come, like if you call in sick, for example?\n\nLIEBER: Yeah, exactly.\n\nMARTIN: OK. So you actually alluded to this. There have been various boycotts at Amazon warehouses in - mainly overseas. Would that be accurate?\n\nLIEBER: I think that there definitely are a lot of strikes and walkouts in Amazon fulfillment centers in Europe. We're definitely seeing a little bit of this movement in the United States. One Amazon warehouse manager that I interviewed had told me that, on Prime Day, the facility that she was working in, people were handing out flyers that they wanted to stage a mass walkout on Prime Day about two years ago and that the managers had been ordered to kind of collect the pamphlets and get rid of them.\n\nYou know, the flipside to that is that if people - I think if people were really, really concerned and they heard that these type of conditions were going on, I think that you'd see more boycotts. I think consumers are definitely interested in the story, but I'm not sure if it's going to stop them from shopping on Amazon.\n\nMARTIN: We know that you've heard from a number of disgruntled Amazon employees or employees who say that they found the conditions - well, in some cases, intolerable, but in other cases, tolerable but unpleasant. Have you heard from others? I mean, have other people commented on your stories to say that that's not the full picture or that they just feel that it's, you know, for whatever - the good outweighs the bad? Have you heard from other perspectives?\n\nLIEBER: Sure. Sure. Well, I mean, Amazon has reached out to me specifically and have, you know, they've told me that these employees that I've been speaking to are one-off and it's not the case all around. Actually, I was able to tour a fulfillment center in Staten Island a few weeks ago and, you know, talked to a few employees there who said that they were, you know, they were happy with the jobs, and they were happy with the wages. They were thrilled with the benefits.\n\nI had a story go up on vox.com about what it was like to work the Black Friday shift. And I had people reach out to me who said that they worked at a warehouse, and this is what the job is. And, you know, they don't agree with people who complain that it's high-pressure and that it's this type of job because the job is the job.\n\nAnd what I want to say to that is, you know, at a certain point, people have to step back and, you know, wonder, like, what goes on inside these warehouses? What are workers saying? And the bottom line that the warehouse workers want me to tell people is that they are human beings that are packing their boxes, and it's not always easy for them. And they want the company to kind of step up and listen to their demands.\n\nMARTIN: That's business reporter Chavie Lieber. She reports on Amazon for Vox, among other subjects that she covers. Chavie Lieber, Thanks so much for talking to us.\n\nLIEBER: Thank you for your time.\n\nMARTIN: We also reached out to Amazon for comment. In a statement, company officials said they work hard to provide a safe, quality work environment for their 250,000 employees across the U.S. They added, quote, \"associates are the heart and soul of our operations.\" [POST BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, Vox reporter Chavie Lieber mistakenly says federal law requires that employees be given breaks.

On Saturday afternoon, he was found hanged with a bedsheet from an air vent in his cell at Ely State Prison, Brooke Santina, a spokeswoman for the department, told NPR.\n\n\"He had not given any indications of being suicidal leading up to his death,\" Santina said, adding that Dozier was housed alone at the time.\n\nHad he verbalized his desire to kill himself, she said, \"the state would have no choice but to put him on suicide watch. But he didn't say anything.\"\n\nThe Marshall Project reported that as recently as December, the 48-year-old's lawyers filed court documents arguing that Dozier's mental health was deteriorating because of the conditions of his confinement.\n\n\"In recent months, Dozier had been regularly put on suicide watch and his family said he was deprived of his belongings and outside contact,\" the criminal justice journal said.\n\nDozier was on death row for 11 years for killing Jeremiah Miller, a methamphetamine drug associate of Dozier's whose body he had decapitated and dismembered in 2002. He was also found guilty of killing Jasen Green, whose remains were found buried in the Arizona desert.\n\nHe gave up the pursuit of appeals in his case in October 2016, becoming what has been called a \"volunteer\" for execution, and called on the state to end his life.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Dozier explained, \"Life in prison isn't a life. ... This isn't living, man. It's just surviving.\"\n\n\"If people say they're going to kill me, get to it,\" he urged.\n\nDozier's death wish thrust Nevada into a new type of legal battle in the debate over the death penalty. It forced the state to obtain a new lethal cocktail because the drugs Nevada had previously relied upon became increasingly difficult to obtain, which is how it arrived at an innovative combination that consisted of midazolam, cisatracurium and, for the first time, fentanyl.\n\nBut in July, Alvogen, a New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company, thwarted Dozier's execution after filing an emergency lawsuit against the Nevada Department of Corrections. It argued officials had illegitimately obtained midazolam, a sedative that is one part of the three-drug cocktail Nevada planned to use to execute Dozier. The drug has been associated with botched executions in Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma and Alabama.\n\nClark County District Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez ruled in favor of the company and barred the use of the drug, putting the execution on hold indefinitely.\n\nIn November 2017, Judge Jennifer Togliatti delayed Dozier's execution, after banning cisatracurium \u2014 a paralyzing drug \u2014 from another proposed deadly drug cocktail.\n\nAlthough the decision was later overturned by the Nevada Supreme Court, Togliatti agreed with an anesthesiologist that \"the paralytic drug could hide signs the other two drugs \u2014 sedative diazepam and opioid painkiller fentanyl \u2014 were failing in the event of a botched execution,\" the Las Vegas Sun reported.\n\nClark Patrick, Dozier's former attorney, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal he was surprised to learn Dozier had apparently taken his own life. Patrick's wife had recently made plans to visit Dozier on Jan. 14.\n\n\"He said he was looking forward to our visit,\" Patrick told the newspaper.\n\nDeath Penalty Information Center Executive Director Robert Dunham told NPR it is unclear what happens next in the legal disputes on using drugs for executions.\n\n\"One of the issues that makes this complicated is that the previous Attorney General's office had not yet decided whether they were going to appeal\" the ban on midazolam, Dunham said.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Adam Laxalt did not run for re-election and, on Monday, was replaced by Democrat Aaron Ford.\n\nFord opposes the death penalty. His office did not respond to NPR's questions regarding the future of the litigation.\n\n\"The other possibility is that Nevada could move to dismiss the appeal by saying that it's moot because Scott Dozier has died and they don't intend to use the drugs to execute anybody else,\" Dunham added.\n\nYet another scenario, according to Dunham, is that one or all of the drugs in the lethal cocktail, obtained more than a year ago, could have expired.\n\n\"And that means that if there's ever another execution, the state will have to start the process of finding new drugs all over again,\" Dunham said."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/07/683021544/president-trump-long-a-fan-of-big-steel-wants-the-border-wall-to-be-made-of-stee", "text": "Trump Sees Border Wall As Another Boost For U.S. Steel Industry\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs President Trump describes it, a steel wall along the Mexican border isn't just about protecting the country from terrorists and drug dealers. It would also be a boon for big steel, an industry he says is essential for American identity.\n\n\"I'll have it done by the United States Steel Corp., by companies in our country that are now powerful, great companies again,\" he said Friday at the White House. \"And they've become powerful over the last two years because of me and because of our trade policies.\"\n\nTrump has made clear how he reveres the beleaguered steel industry, once saying that without one, \"You almost don't have much of a country.\"\n\nSince taking office, Trump has filled his administration with former steel industry executives and attorneys, such as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. They have made reviving the industry a major priority, by protecting it from what they say are unfair foreign trade practices.\n\nLast year, the administration slapped tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum.\n\nThe tariffs have been highly controversial, especially because they were justified on national security grounds. But the biggest source of U.S. steel imports is Canada, a strong American ally.\n\nDespite that, the tariffs have benefited big steel, by raising the price of imports and easing the pressure on domestic companies to keep their prices low.\n\n\"Our steel industry is now thriving and getting better every single day and it's jobs, and it's that money pouring into our coffers. It's beautiful,\" Trump said at a Missouri campaign rally in November 2018.\n\nTrump has claimed \u2014 falsely \u2014 that seven steel plants are being built as a result of the boon touched off by his trade agenda. But at least one new plant is being built and some others are being upgraded. And profits are up for big companies such as Nucor and U.S. Steel.\n\n\"Orders are up. Shipments are up. Hiring is up. Wages are up,\" says Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. \"No matter which metric you look at, the steel industry is unquestioningly doing better than it has been for the past couple of years.\"\n\nBut numerous manufacturers have also complained that they're being hurt by higher prices for imported steel and aluminum. That includes companies in key industries such as housing and autos.\n\n\"The problem, of course, is that as you lend a hand to particular producers \u2014 producers of upstream products like steel \u2014 you raise the cost of production for steel-consuming industries and steel-consuming firms,\" says Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies.\n\nIn fact, the number of companies that use steel is much greater than the number of steel-producing firms, he notes.\n\n\"If you do the math, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to go to bat for the steel industry in the first place, because you're really hurting a more significant portion of the economy,\" Ikenson says.\n\nManufacturers that are unable to acquire the steel they need from domestic suppliers can ask the Commerce Department for an exemption from the tariffs. But the government has been slow to process the exemptions, and many companies are still waiting to hear about their requests.\n\nIkenson is also less than impressed with the industry's alleged boom, saying it has a lot to do with broader economic forces.\n\n\"The steel industry is a cyclical industry. It ebbs and flows with the economy, and right now the economy is sort of peaked out and perhaps beginning to slow down a little bit. If you look at steel stock indexes, they're about where they were a year ago,\" he says."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/04/682110868/congresswoman-tlaib-inspires-palestinian-americans-with-a-dress-and-a-hashtag", "text": "Congresswoman Tlaib Inspires Palestinian-Americans With A Dress And A Hashtag\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Democrat Rashida Tlaib became the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress. She wore an intricately embroidered red and black robe to her swearing-in ceremony and laid her left hand upon a Quran as she took her oath of office, inspiring legions of Palestinian-Americans who saw themselves in the attorney from Michigan.\n\nIn December, Tlaib posted a photograph to Instagram showing her wardrobe choice for the ceremony: a thobe, a floor-length black robe covered in red embroidery. She writes in Elle magazine that people from all over the country messaged her and planned to tweet pictures of themselves with the hashtag #TweetYourThobe. Tlaib adds that the garment was an integral part of her childhood:\n\n\"As a young girl, I watched my mother hand stitch thobes while sitting on the floor with a lamp at her side. She would make the small designs of flowers and different shapes. Just thinking about it brings up so many memories of my mother and how proud she was of being Palestinian. My mom is a woman who grew up in a small farming village in the West Bank called Beit Ur El Foka. She only went up to 8th grade and then dropped out to go work in a tailor shop that made dresses and different embroidered designs to make money for her family.\"\n\nTlaib writes wearing the thobe was \"an unapologetic display of the fabric of the people in this country.\"\n\nAs Tlaib took the oath in her robe, hundreds of women posted photographs of themselves in matching style.\n\nOne Lebanese-Palestinian law student tweeted a photograph of herself in a thobe dancing the traditional Arab folk dance called the dabke and wrote, \"count one young Palestinian woman with a lump in her throat thinking about how far our people have come.\"\n\nMSNBC anchor Ayman Mohyeldin tweeted a picture of his daughter and niece in thobes. He said it was in homage to his Palestinian mother.\n\nThobes are elaborate garments. The stitching, known as tatreez, can take months and the most intricate sell for more than $1,000. They are commonly worn by older women, but younger women also wear them, especially at special events. Instagram user bellqees wrote that \"a Palestinian thobe is a love letter to the gardens we played in as children and picked fruit from as adults.\"\n\nThe thobe is also a symbol of Palestinian nationalism. In 2009, women in the West Bank city of Hebron sewed and embroidered a black and red dress that was 107 feet long and aimed to get recognized by the Guinness World Records, according to the BBC.\n\nPalestinian folk artist Feryal Abbasi Ghnaim told the Institute for Palestine Studies that in traditional rural life, girls were often confined to the home while boys played outside and went to school, and so they learned the handicrafts from their mothers and grandmothers. Ghnaim said the cross-stitch is the mainstay of Palestinian embroidery patterns, and colors and patterns could signal women hailed from certain regions or were married or pregnant.\n\nAuthor Lena Khalaf Tuffaha\u200f wrote that she wore a thobe that dated more than 100 years from Beersheba.\n\nHistory teacher Hanna Alshaikh tweeted that she wore a thobe when she graduated from her master's program.\n\nRashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., are the first Muslim women elected to Congress. Omar takes the seat of Democrat Keith Ellison, who was the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2006.\n\nTlaib and Omar are among the most diverse class of congressional lawmakers in U.S. history, including the first Native American women, Reps. Sharice Davids, D-Kan., and Deb Haaland, D-N.M., and the first openly bisexual senator, Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. Haaland wore a traditional Pueblo dress for her swearing in.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nThe junior lawmakers are also among the more liberal flank of the party. On Tlaib's first day in office, she published an op-ed in the Detroit Free Press titled, \"Now is the time to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\" Moderate voices in the party, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have warned against impeachment unless the measure is bipartisan.\n\nLater in the day, Tlaib provoked more controversy when she issued a profane impeachment threat against the president during a reception hosted by the progressive advocacy organization, MoveOn.org. Tlaib told the crowd: \"... we're gonna go in there and we're gonna impeach the motherf*****.\" The crowd roared.\n\nTlaib often speaks about her Palestinian heritage, but as a representative of a district where fewer than 5 percent of voters identify as Arab-American, she campaigned on broader issues. As an attorney, she has focused her career on environmental advocacy, reports NPR's Camila Domonoske. Tlaib led the charge against Koch Carbon for heaping petroleum coke on the banks of the Detroit River. She has also pledged to fight for Medicare for all."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2018/12/18/677776208/npr-musics-best-classical-albums-of-2018", "text": "NPR Music's Best Classical Albums Of 2018\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Stith/New Amsterdam Records David Stith/New Amsterdam Records\n\nNarrowing a list to just 10 is always a painful game. This year, amid a multitude of albums, I found favorite musicians (V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsson), newcomers (the young Aizuri Quartet) and familiar players in compelling collaborations (Brooklyn Rider and Magos Herrera), all offering fascinating performances of music from the baroque to the freshly minted. Think of the albums on this list as portals. They'll take you to Tsarist Russia, the New Mexico desert, 18th-century Spain, the austere landscapes of Iceland, Vienna at the dawn of the 20th century. Happy traveling.\n\nNear the bottom of this article, find a Spotify playlist including selections from each of the below (aside from the Aizuri Quartet, whose music is unavailable on the platform.)\n\nYouTube\n\nBoston Symphony Orchestra, Andris Nelsons, cond.\n\nShostakovich: Symphonies Nos. 4 & 11 \"The Year 1905\"\n\nConductor Andris Nelsons and the Boston Symphony Orchestra play as if their lives depended on it in their ongoing cycle of Shostakovich symphonies. It's a fitting response to music composed by a man who, throughout the grim years of Stalin's purges, feared for his own life.\n\nThe Fourth Symphony, written in the heady months before Shostakovich's first fall from Soviet grace in 1936, and shelved for 25 years, charges out of the gate with rare intensity in this live recording. I doubt you'll hear a string section play as blisteringly fast or as precise in the Presto section, which is rendered here nothing short of a symphonic panic attack. For all its angst and bluster, the Fourth ends mysteriously, with a celeste evaporating into a gray sky of low strings.\n\nThe Eleventh Symphony, composed 20 years later, picks up that ethereal mood, unfolding into a series of tableau depicting events and emotions surrounding \"Bloody Sunday,\" when Tsarist guards opened fire on the public outside the winter palace in 1905. The work has never sounded as atmospheric, as vital and as conflicted as it does here. These are performances of shattering virtuosity in luxuriously recorded sound.\n\n(This review originally appeared on NPR Music's list of the 50 Best Albums of 2018.)\n\nYouTube\n\nMagos Herrera & Brooklyn Rider\n\nDreamers\n\nTrue artists take risks. While it may sound incongruous to pair a Mexican jazz singer with a classical string quartet, the gamble paid off spectacularly in Dreamers. One is tempted to think of Herrera as the star of the album, but that wouldn't tell the whole story. While her smoky, beguiling voice has never sounded more expressive and grand, Herrera's fellow musicians are no mere \"backup band.\" Brooklyn Rider, along with percussionists Mathias Kunzli and Gonzalo Grau, are as much in dialogue with the singer as they are offering evocative moods and textures in an album steeped in Latin American culture.\n\nThe album's title alone connotes its socially conscious threads \u2014 \"Ni\u00f1a,\" with a text by Mexican poet and diplomat Octavio Paz, captures the elemental power of children. The fevered love song \"Tu y Yo\" is set to words by the pioneering Nicaraguan poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo. Other songs flash back to the nueva canc\u00edon movement in Latin America in the 1960s, when songwriters paired socially poignant lyrics with folk-infused melodies. The best of these is the haunting \"Volver a Los 17,\" which argues for feelings over reason, and weaves the Chilean cueca dance into its lilting refrain.\n\nHerrera, who is a spokesperson for the United Nations campaign Unite to End Violence Against Women, has given us a vocally resplendent album, one for the head and the heart.\n\nYouTube\n\nInternational Contemporary Ensemble\n\nAequa (Music of Anna Thorvaldsdottir)\n\nThe mark of a great composer, it's been said, is an unmistakable sound. Agree or not, the music of Anna Thorvaldsdottir is detectable in just a few atmospheric notes. Inspired by nature, including the beautiful and austere landscapes of her native Iceland, the 41-year-old composer says she doesn't depict the natural world in her music. Instead, she's interested in structures like proportion and flow. Still, the cinematic nature of her textures and colors could brilliantly soundtrack a National Geographic documentary of her homeland, conjuring images of smoldering geysers, groaning tectonic plates and translucent volcano lakes.\n\nAequa offers mostly recent compositions, ranging from the crepuscular Scrape, for solo piano, where low tones drone and strings are plucked, to Aequilibria, for large chamber ensemble, where wind instruments flutter, bells toll deep in the piano, strings are slurred and jolting crescendos crack through the darkness. Sequences, for a quartet of low winds, is all about breath. The music sways with mammoth respirations. A contrabassoon snores peacefully, like a sleeping giant, while the bass clarinet wheezes and a bass flute and baritone saxophone exhale wisps of melody. It's one of the most evocative pieces for winds I've heard. With these vibrant performances by the International Contemporary Ensemble, Thorvaldsdottir once again proves to be among the most distinctive voices today.\n\nYouTube\n\nForma Antiqva\n\nConcerto Zapico Vol. 2\n\nBefore I fell in love with the crackling performances on this album, I'd never heard of the band Forma Antiqva. Turns out, it's a flexible ensemble led by a trio of Spanish brothers: Aar\u00f3n, Daniel and Pablo Zapico, who play keyboards, theorbo (a large lute) and baroque guitar, respectively. The energy, precision and rhythmic drive they inject into this Spanish baroque dance music is nothing short of intoxicating. \"Canarios,\" the opening track by 17th century guitarist and priest Gaspar Sanz, sparkles with syncopated interplay between the brothers. The percussion, added by David Mayoral, gives the performance extra zing right through to the rock and roll ending.\n\nYouTube\n\nAizuri Quartet\n\nBlueprinting\n\nThese limber and luminous performances by the Aizuri Quartet, in music written specifically for the group by young composers, proves that the 250-year-old string quartet formula remains vibrant and vital. Blueprinting, the band's Grammy-nominated debut album, sports a thoughtful Beethoven-inspired piece (Blueprint) by new music darling Caroline Shaw. But the pieces by four other, lesser-known composers are equally compelling. Gabriella Smith's Carrot Revolution sizzles with slurred melodies and pulsating beats, while Yevgeniy Sharlat's RIPEFG memorializes a friend by contrasting movements of frenzy and quiet introspection with the addition of a melodica. Lembit Beecher draws from his opera to create an evocative dream state of slippery string figures and his own \"sound sculpture\" of wine glasses and music box. If Haydn were alive to write a string quartet today, it may sound something like Paul Wiancko's LIFT, which looks back to the conventions of the genre from a postmodern perch.\n\nYouTube\n\nChristian Tetzlaff\n\nBart\u00f3k : Violin Concertos Nos. 1 & 2\n\nViolinist Christian Tetzlaff wants you to dive deep into these two concertos, and to achieve that he gets out of the way. He's not interested in stamping his own personal interpretation on the music \u2014 though his performances sound like no other. Instead, he eschews big gestures and look-at-me moments to let his formidable, clear-eyed technique tell B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's stories. The composer was still in his 20s in 1908 when he completed his First Concerto, dedicated to a lover, a violinist named Stefi Geyer, who never played it. The piece would receive its debut in 1958, long after Bart\u00f3k's death. Tetzlaff channels the composer's pent-up passions and frustrations in dramatically nuanced performances. The romantic theme in the opening movement is played with tenderness, and a remarkably sweet tone, way up at the top of the violin's register. The high-wire scalar runs that open the second movement \u2013 a testament to Geyer's virtuosity \u2013 are dispatched cleanly, and with a hint of irony.\n\nIn Bart\u00f3k's more popular Second Concerto, from 30 years after his first, Tetzlaff taps into the folk influences of the opening theme, while conductor Hannu Lintu and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra expertly judge tricky balances between the harp, French horn and string pizzicatos. Teztlaff, portraying these concertos, is like that great character actor whose performances are so natural they rarely get the praise they deserve.\n\nYouTube\n\nV\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsson\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nOn the heels of last year's incandescent Philip Glass album, Icelandic pianist V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsson turns to his longtime muse with an album simply titled Johann Sebastian Bach. Like many Bach enthusiasts, \u00d3lafsson perceives the great German composer as a kind of musical nucleus, continuously radiating inspiration. Evidence of the worship results in warm, translucent performances that are personal, poetic and precise.\n\n\u00d3lafsson performs arrangements of Bach's music by a variety of famed pianists, including a hypersonic Choral Prelude (BWV 734) by Wilhelm Kempf, a mesmerizing Prelude (BWV 855a) by Alexander Siloti (Rachmaninoff's teacher) and, best of all, his own tender and probing transcription of \"Widerstehe doch der S\u00fcnde,\" an aria from Cantata No. 54. Over a heartbeat pulse in the bass, \u00d3lafsson weaves melodies of uncommon beauty.\n\nAt the album's core, \u00d3lafsson makes a convincing case for Bach's Aria variata (BWV 989), a lesser-known set of variations (compared to the Goldbergs), finding virtuosity, solace and the spirit of dance within the music. \u00d3lafsson has been dubbed \"Iceland's Glenn Gould,\" but that's not really fair. Here is a thoughtful pianist, thoroughly his own artist, who brilliant performs the music of his master.\n\n(This review originally appeared on NPR Music's list of the 50 Best Albums of 2018.)\n\nYouTube\n\nBarbara Hannigan\n\nVienna: Fin de Si\u00e8cle\n\nBarbara Hannigan, a fearless soprano who champions new music of all stripes, steps back in time a bit to the heady days of Vienna at the turn of the 20th century. It was a time when composers were pushing the borderlines of traditional romantic harmony towards modernism, finding new color and emotion along the way. Arnold Schoenberg's \"Schenk mir deinen goldenen Kamm\" (Give Me Your Golden Comb) offers a kind of sacred sensuality, as Jesus shares an intimate moment with Mary Magdalene. Hannigan's tone at the final cry of \"Magdalene\" is an object lesson in how to color the voice with emotion. She sweetens her sound in Zemlinsky's gorgeous \"Empf\u00e4gnis\" (Conception), while in Anton Webern's compact \"Am Ufer\" (On the Shore), every overripe note is charged with anticipation. Songs by Alma Mahler are a welcome addition, especially \"Licht in der Nacht\" (Light in the Night), where Hannigan offers a beautiful, darkly colored singing line. With painter-like touches, pianist Reinbert de Leeuw excels in every searching harmony, every lonely pause between notes.\n\nYouTube\n\nBBC Symphony Orchestra, soloists, John Adams, cond.\n\nAdams: Doctor Atomic\n\nWith baritone Gerald Finley as Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and soprano Julia Bullock as his wife, Kitty, this debut recording of John Adams' 2005 opera, Doctor Atomic, guarantees compelling listening. Adams, something of our nation's operatic documentarian, gets uncomfortably behind the scenes of the creation \u2014 and detonation \u2014 of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert in July, 1945. The opera is more of a psychological thriller than a story of a nation at war, and the characters freak out over the power they are about to unleash. You never hear the bomb explode in the opera, although you certainly think about it. Instead, what Adams, with his librettist and longtime collaborator Peter Sellars, pulls off at the end is far more devastating: the lone voice of a Japanese woman, asking for water. The composer himself conducts a tightly knit performance of the opera, which contains some of his most arresting music.\n\nEnlarge this image Chandos Chandos\n\nSilesian Quartet and Friends\n\nBacewicz: Quartets and Quintets\n\nIn her native Poland, streets are named after Gra\u017cyna Bacewicz, but the composer's rigorously constructed music has struggled for attention almost everywhere else. Lately, thanks to the Silesian Quartet (and friends), Bacewicz is getting the posthumous recognition she deserves, mainly through recordings like this absorbing album of chamber music composed between 1949 and 1965.\n\nA violin virtuoso and a formidable pianist, Bacewicz managed to carve out a career in the turbulent years before and during communist era Poland. Bacewicz wrote symphonies, concertos and stage works, but she arguably shined brightest when crafting the intricate musical conversations that unfold within chamber music. The Piano Quintet No. 1, anchored by an aching central slow movement, shifts seamlessly from somber motifs to lyrical folk infusions. The Second Piano Quintet, more progressive, finds piano and strings separated in muscular arguments. Two short, fascinating quartets round out the album \u2014 one for four violins that dances and sings, another darker, more experimental one for four cellos. The Silesian Quartet, based in Katowice, Poland, has already released an award-winning album of the composer's string quartets, will continue to help drive the Bacewicz bandwagon.

We will not do that. We will adhere to human rights under the rule of law,\" said Thai Immigration Police chief Maj. Gen. Surachate Hakparn.\n\nAlqunun has been granted temporary entry into Thailand under the protection of the U.N. refugee agency which is expected to take between five to seven days to evaluate her claim for asylum in Australia.\n\nEarlier in the day, Alqunun's father arrived in Thailand, setting off concerns that she might be forced to return to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"My father just arrived,\" she said in an update on Monday, adding that it \"worried and scared me a lot.\"\n\nThai officials had arranged for Alqunun to be on a flight out of Bangkok on Monday, but she refused to leave her airport hotel room before she spoke to someone from the U.N. Refugee Agency, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nRepeating her desire to leave Thailand for another country where she can seek asylum, Alqunun said, \"But at least I feel [safe] now under UNHCR protection with the agreement of Thailand authorities. And I finally got my passport back.\"\n\nAlqunun was stopped at the Thai airport Saturday night as she attempted to travel to Australia, where she had planned to seek asylum. With that avenue closed and fearing what might come next if she were forced to return to her family, she took to social media while holed up in an airport transit hotel room.\n\n\"I'm in real danger,\" Alqunun said in a Twitter account that sprang into existence over the weekend, posting anguished pleas to anyone who would listen.\n\n\"I am real, I exist, I am still breathing, but I am not sure I can continue or that I can stay alive unless the Saudi embassy stops pursuing me,\" she wrote. Her appeals have attracted tens of thousands of followers.\n\nThe Saudi national said she was seeking asylum in any Western country that would have her.\n\nAsia Authorities In Thailand Say Young Saudi Woman Awaiting Deportation Can Stay \u2014 For Now Authorities In Thailand Say Young Saudi Woman Awaiting Deportation Can Stay \u2014 For Now Listen \u00b7 2:22 2:22\n\nHuman rights groups and Western embassies implored the Thai government not to return the woman to Saudi Arabia. A group of Thai lawyers filed an injunction to prevent her from being deported back to Saudi Arabia, Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, tells NPR.\n\nNow, authorities in Thailand have reversed their earlier position and called off the deportation, Michael Sullivan reports for NPR. \"The head of Thailand's immigration police told reporters she would not be returned against her will,\" Sullivan says. \"Supporters hope she'll be given her passport back and allowed to continue her journey to Australia.\"\n\nAlqunun had been on vacation with her family in Kuwait last week, when she slipped away and boarded a plane to Bangkok. Her family was abusive, especially since she had renounced Islam, she told the BBC. Her plan was to fly through Thailand to Australia. But while she was in the Thai airport, she said security officials stopped her, claiming her family had filed a missing person report. Alqunun said they took her passport and forced her to come with them.\n\nThey took her to a hotel room to await a flight back to Kuwait and then Saudi Arabia \"by FORCE,\" she wrote. But while in the hotel room, Alqunun barricaded herself in and posted a video to social media. \"I'm not leaving my room until I see UNHCR,\" she said. \"I want asylum.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, a team from the U.N. arrived and was permitted to interview Alqunun, according to her Twitter account. \"They gave their word that she would remain in their custody & that she is now safe.\"\n\nOfficials had been trying to send Alqunun back to Kuwait City on an 11:15 a.m. flight, but because she refused to leave her hotel room, the flight left without her.\n\nAlqunun's father is a senior government official in the Saudi government, Robertson said. \"And so if she's sent back to Kuwait, it's basically the same as sending her back to Saudi,\" he said. \"They will just grab her and take her across the border very quickly.\"\n\nAlqunun told Reuters she was seeking refugee status because of \"physical, emotional and verbal abuse and being imprisoned inside the house for months. They threaten to kill me and prevent me from continuing my education. They won't let me drive or travel. I am oppressed. I love life and work and I am very ambitious but my family is preventing me from living.\"\n\nThai authorities say they weren't acting at the request of the Saudi government when they detained Alqunun. She was denied entry because she lacked a hotel reservation or paid return ticket, Thai immigration chief Surachate Hakparn told Reuters.\n\n\"The Thai government is playing games, and is frankly playing footsie, with the Saudi government,\" Robertson told NPR earlier in the day. Saudi Arabia is denying that their people were at the airport, Robertson said. \"Saudi Arabia is lying through their teeth on this one.\"\n\nBut the international support for Alqunun appears to have persuaded Thai officials allow the U.N refugee agency some time to help her.\n\n\"As of now, she does not wish to go back and we will not force her. She won't be sent anywhere tonight,\" Surachate said at a news conference according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"She fled hardship. Thailand is a land of smiles,\" he said.\n\nAlqunun is \"incredibly courageous and brave, and she's exhausted, but she is prepared to fight to the end,\" Robertson said. \"And we're prepared to help her any way we can.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/03/681851521/lifetimes-series-about-r-kelly-depicts-a-darker-side-to-the-singer", "text": "Making 'Surviving R. Kelly': A Conversation With Executive Producer Dream Hampton\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mike Pont/Getty Images Mike Pont/Getty Images\n\nListen at the audio link to hear Eric Deggans' review of Surviving R. Kelly. Read on for his extended interview with the show's executive producer, cultural critic dream hampton.\n\nWhen executive producer dream hampton was pulling together Lifetime's exhaustive six-part docuseries Surviving R. Kelly, she made a point of reaching out to stars in the music business about the show's core allegations: that one of R&B's biggest-selling talents has spent decades pursuing sex with underage girls, maintaining abusive relationships with women and videotaping sexual activities without their consent.\n\nThe program about R. Kelly, which began airing Thursday and concludes Saturday, features a few big names in music, like Grammy winner John Legend and radio host Tom Joyner. But according to hampton, many more stars said no.\n\n\"We asked everyone,\" hampton says, noting they also asked people from the record labels that have released Kelly's work. \"I think [they said no because] they'd have to deal with their own complicity.\"\n\nSurviving R. Kelly makes the case that the music industry and many fans have downplayed or ignored controversies around Kelly as he allegedly used his fame and wealth to refine his strategies for seducing underage girls and young women. At its core is a succession of interviews with women who say the singer held them in residences and studios where they had to ask his permission to eat and use the bathroom; sometimes, they were cut off from family and friends, and were physically abused.\n\nAll of the women who say in the docuseries that they were abused by Kelly have previously made public allegations against the singer, but Surviving R. Kelly's power comes in hearing their stories told on camera, and all together.\n\nKelly has denied such allegations in the past; the series notes in each episode that the singer and his representatives did not respond after several attempts to get their comments. TMZ reported Thursday that an attorney for Kelly sent a letter threatening to sue Lifetime if it aired the program, but no such legal action has yet been announced. (R. Kelly's management declined to comment to NPR about the series or any possible legal action related to it.)\n\nFeaturing material from more than 50 interviews, the show reaches back to the singer's earliest days, when he was Robert Sylvester Kelly growing up in Chicago. Producers spoke to two of Kelly's brothers, his ex-wife, music journalists and several of Kelly's former employees, along with experts in psychology and abuse who spoke about the dynamics of how such relationships evolve.\n\nAnd several major controversies from Kelly's past are explored in detail \u2014 from his marriage to 15-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Aaliyah in the mid-1990s to the appearance of a leaked sex tape in the early 2000s allegedly showing him with an underage girl, his prosecution and acquittal six years later on child pornography charges connected to that video and recent allegations he has isolated young women in something resembling a \"sex cult.\"\n\nIn an interview with NPR, hampton \u2014 who is an occasional contributor to NPR Music \u2014 talked about how, given Kelly's success and range of projects, she believes that \"dozens, if not hundreds of people\" had to be complicit in helping him.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nEric Deggans: Let's start with you coming onto this project, and how you wound up being the showrunner on this docuseries.\n\ndream hampton: I was not thinking about R. Kelly. I mean, he has been somewhere in the back of my mind, particularly when the stories about Harvey Weinstein began to break and when the #MeToo movement really began to pick up steam. And like [#MeToo founder] Tarana Burke, I remember thinking, \"Why isn't R. Kelly being held accountable in this moment?\"\n\nBut I can't say that I was thinking about doing some expos\u00e9 on him. I was invited into this project by an executive at Bunim/Murray [Productions] \u2014 and that executive, Jesse Daniels, and Tamara Simmons, another co-EP on this project, have been holding these relationships with some of his survivors for months before I came on board. I remember talking to them early on, kind of figuring out if we were going to work together. ... Having been adjacent in some ways to the music industry, when there was one, I knew that it it took dozens, if not hundreds of people, for R. Kelly to operate as long as he has in the way that he has.\n\nYou've talked about feeling like you, yourself, had a missed opportunity with R. Kelly years ago, where you interviewed him but weren't aware fully of all that he was doing.\n\nWhen I went to interview R. Kelly, it was the summer of 2000 and I was doing a story for Vibe magazine. We knew about the early marriage for sure: We knew that this 27-year-old man had married a 15-year-old, not unlike Elvis having married 14-year-old Priscilla. [Editor's note: See correction below. Elvis and Priscilla Presley met when she was 14 but did not marry for eight more years.] There have been those relationships, if we're honest, in our own families when we go back just a couple of generations \u2014 how old was our grandfather when he married our grandmother, and so on and so forth. But it was disgusting. ... I absolutely asked him about Aaliyah. He was offended that I had. I remember he called me afterwards to kind of yell at me about it being in there.\n\nWhat began to become clear a few months after my story was published, with [Chicago-based reporter] Jim DeRogatis' relentless reporting that really began in December of 2000 with the leak of the sex tape, was how many cases [Kelly] began to settle after Aaliyah. [DeRogatis is also a host of member station WBEZ's program Sound Opinions. -ed.] That this wasn't just some very not-OK marriage to a teenager \u2014 and I don't mean to make light of that, it's incredibly not OK. But that this was predatory behavior, that he had settled several lawsuits with teenagers, and then this sex abuse tape comes out.\n\nIt is with great regret that I say that I missed it. And to Vibe's credit \u2014 Danyel Smith was editor-in-chief at the time \u2014 my story probably hit the streets in September, and by the time Jim's story comes out in December, Danyel sent someone from Vibe right back out to get the story right on R. Kelly. But that wasn't me.\n\nYou got some very key people. I mean, his ex-wife [Andrea Kelly, who has accused R. Kelly of physical abuse]. Sparkle, his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, who maintains that she introduced the underage girl who is the victim in the video to him. You got two of his brothers to speak on camera. How did you get these people, and how did you get them to talk about these subjects that are so tough to talk about?\n\nSparkle has a really good friend and manager ... who vetted me for weeks, and I really appreciated how guarded he was of her. She testified at the trial that that was her teenage niece being abused by R. Kelly on camera, a girl that she had introduced to him at 12, just as she introduced a lot of her family.\n\nHer story to me, and I don't mean to sound too production-y, but it was a get. I'd heard Andrea Kelly tell a bit of her story; I had heard the brothers in different places, on radio, talk about their brother, and I knew those relationships were estranged. Sparkle was someone who, when she came forward, she risked it all, and she lost it all. Jive Records dropped her when she testified against R. Kelly. She of course was one of his artists, so he wasn't going to manage or produce her anymore, and I'm sure she didn't want that. But more than that, she lost her family. She talked about not speaking to her family for a decade because of coming forward. One of the things that she was most reticent about was reopening those wounds and possibly not being able to spend Christmas with her family because she was doing this show.\n\nAnd that was a common theme: Yes, these girls' lives are destroyed, but you see whole families who, decades later, are still dealing with the trauma that R. Kelly has left behind.\n\nHow long did it take you to pull these stories, all this material together?\n\nWell, there were some false starts in terms of how we were going to tell the story. Again, Tamara Simmons and Jesse Daniels had been holding the space for these relationships [with accusers]. Tamara Simmons in particular was getting calls at 3 in the morning from the families \u2014 and then the families would introduce us to new victims, some of whom wanted to come on camera, many of whom did not.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Lifetime Courtesy of Lifetime\n\nAnd then, I come from a history of having done cultural criticism, so I was able to get a lot of those voices in there: Nelson George, [NPR correspondent] Ann Powers, Jamilah Lemieux. But when it came to industry insiders, I got a whole bunch of noes. I really want to shout out John Legend for even coming on camera \u2014 someone with his stature just agreeing to go on the record and say what he said.\n\nWhy do you think they said no?\n\nI think they'd have to deal with their own complicity. There's a whole lot of \"what about\"-ism; that is one of the ways that we see conversations around abuse derailed all of the time, whether it's Weinstein and we get the \"What about the casting couch in Hollywood in the '30s?\" And like, what? We're talking about this person and we're talking about these cases.\n\nThere are various messages in the series saying you guys tried to get a response from R. Kelly and he has not responded. [This interview was recorded on Jan. 2, the day before the first two episodes aired. -ed.] Is that still true?\n\nR. Kelly and his team have been given many of the quotes that are in the piece, many of the facts and obviously an opportunity to be interviewed several times. And he has turned us down.\n\nIs there any concern that he might sue?\n\nI mean, I think we had those concerns every single day that we were in production. There was never an interview that I conducted that didn't have an attorney from Bunim/Murray in the room. A&E, who owns Lifetime, is a publicly held company and they have their legal department.So this was vetted beyond anything I've ever done before.\n\nI know these are different cases, but I think about Bill Cosby and how people, for some reason, just seemed to get amnesia about the allegations against him \u2014 until we hit about 2015 and it seemed that our sensibility about those allegations changed. People took them more seriously, he wasn't able to mount this whole rehabilitation tour that he had kind of built for himself, and he wound up being charged with crimes and and convicted.\n\nDo you think that a series like this is meeting that moment? That maybe our feelings in regard to all these things that he's been accused of and connected to over the decades have changed enough that people are going to react differently?\n\nWell, I think it's because of the work of people like the creators of #MuteRKelly, who are also in the docuseries, that somewhere like Lifetime was even interested. Say they were interested before; they knew that this was the moment that they could actually get this made.\n\nBut moreover, I filmed a #MuteRKelly protest in my hometown, Detroit, at a concert that he was at. And I watched those protesters, black women, be yelled at by other black women and black men. \"Get a man.\" \"He was found innocent.\" \"You need to go home.\" It disgusted me. If we were out there protesting about any number of issues ... we would not have been met with the kind of scorn from black people that those protesters were met with.\n\nAnd so it's those people \u2014 I want them to be unable to loudly declare their defense of R. Kelly. They can do it quietly. They can play their R. Kelly records and do whatever they want to do. But they should have some shame attached to that.\n\nYou had to cancel one screening because there were threats called in. Now we're at the point of having the series here, on television. Are you concerned at all about what his more devoted fans might do when it hits the public?\n\nI'm not afraid of R. Kelly or his fans. I mean, they can't call in and cancel what's going to be in people's living rooms. I think that whatever energy they think they're about to engage in trying to defend him ... they all need to be looking at themselves. Don't come looking for the girls; definitely don't come looking for me. Look in the mirror."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/01/03/680542815/if-a-worm-makes-you-sick-can-this-cup-of-tea-cure-you", "text": "If A Worm Makes You Sick, Can This Cup Of Tea Cure You?\n\nSchistosomiasis is listed as a \"neglected\" tropical disease by the World Health Organization \u2014 one of those diseases that's been overlooked by modern medicine.\n\nIt mainly hits poor people in poor countries \u2014 and it hits a lot of them, up to 200 million a year. There are only a few drugs available to treat it. There are no designer drugs being cooked up in a lab in Europe for schistosomiasis. Doctoral students rarely pen their thesis on this disease.\n\nBut schistosomiasis can also be \"neglected\" by the very people it attacks. It can be a stealth disease. The infection starts slowly. A flatworm penetrates the skin of someone walking or working or swimming in contaminated water. The person doesn't feel sick. They pick up more parasites.\n\nThe host still feels fine, doesn't even know he or she is infected. The worms start having sex. They multiply. As the parasite population grows the person starts to feel sluggish, slightly off. The worm invasion may cause a fever or some abdominal pain but most people don't realize something's wrong. In parts of Africa and South East Asia where schistosomiasis is rampant, people can be infected for years before they start feeling sick.\n\nThe standard treatment is a drug called praziquantel \u2014 three doses spread out over the course of one day can cure most people of the worms that cause schistosomiasis.\n\nBut what if tea from a local plant worked just as well?\n\nPam Weathers, a biologist at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, has spent a lot of time studying how artimisinin and other derivatives of the wormwood shrub attack malaria parasites in people. She figured wormwood might also kill the worms that cause schistosomiasis.\n\nSo along with her colleagues she ran a trial on 800 people in the Maniema Province in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of whom had schistosomiasis. Half were treated with the drug, and half got wormwood tea.\n\nIn a new study published this month, she reports that sweet wormwood tea can cure schistosomiasis faster and with fewer side effects than the most common drug treatment.\n\n\"They had to drink these tea infusions daily for seven days and then you would see what happened to their worm infestations, which is not a pretty thing to do,\" she says with a laugh. \"It means looking at fecal samples to see if the eggs are gone. I'm glad it wasn't in that lab but that's how it has to be detected.\"\n\nThe people who got the conventional drug and the people who drank the tea all were completely cleared of the parasites. But the group sipping the wormwood infusions got rid of the parasites faster and reported fewer side effects. \"It [the tea] is much more benign on the patient,\" she says. The pharmaceutical treatment with praziquantel can cause headaches, nausea and fatigue.\n\nOne downside of the sweet wormwood tea is that despite the \"sweet\" in its name, it's actually quite bitter. Some people like it while others hate it.\n\nWeathers falls in the hater group and was surprised to find that anyone thought it tastes good. \"I'm like, you're kidding me because I can't stand it,\" she says.\n\nBut one of the benefits of using sweet wormwood is that the shrub grows readily in lots of the warm tropical places where schistosomiasis is a problem.\n\n\"The thought initially was that they we're going to try and let people grow the plant in their own gardens and then just make their own tea,\" Weathers says. This turned out to be not as easy as it might seem. The tea infusion had to be the right strength to be effective, and people had to be told to not store the prepared tea for more than a day or it would lose efficacy.\n\nThe new study from Weathers and her colleagues doesn't tackle those logistical issues. It simply set out to compare the wormwood tea treatment against the common drug therapy. And in that regard wormwood tea was a success.\n\n\"This is an important disease,\" says Sue Montgomery, who heads the parasitic disease branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Montgomery wasn't involved with the wormwood tea study and says she doesn't want to comment directly on it. She notes that in other studies wormwood has showed promise in killing immature stages of the schistisoma parasite.\n\n\"But those are all in studies that have yet to be scaled up to the point where those drugs would be used in control programs,\" she says. Which is also true of Weathers wormwood tea study. It's still in the study stage and the tea is not yet being widely used to combat schistosomiasis.\n\nThe bigger problem with schistosomiasis is that just purging the parasites by pill or by tea won't lead to the elimination of the disease.\n\nSchistosomiasis is spread in a cycle involving people and a particular species of freshwater snails.\n\n\"You have to have three things occurring in the same place to have transmission of schistosomiasis,\" Montgomery says. \"You need people who are infected with the parasite. You need water sources that contain the appropriate snails that are intermediate hosts. And you have to have a situation where human waste is making its way into that water.\" Human feces and urine carry the parasite's eggs back out to the water source.\n\nSo just killing off all the parasites that are inside people doesn't do any good if they can get re-infected the next day by contaminated water.\n\n\"It's almost impossible to get rid of [schistosomiasis] just by treating repeatedly,\" Montgomery says. \"What it really requires is improvements in water and sanitation.\"\n\nAnd upgrading an entire community's water and waste systems is a lot harder than giving a patient a pill or some tea.\n\nBut tackling schistosomiasis, Montgomery says, is important. As more and more worms accumulate in a person, Montgomery says, the individual suffers a lack of energy and has trouble digesting food. As the number of worms swells and they lodge their eggs in various organs, many people end up with a fibrosis of the liver. And in a worst case scenario ...\n\n\"It influences the blood circulation, then it leads to enlarged blood vessels around the liver, which sometimes burst into your esophagus,\" Montgomery says. \"And you can actually end up bleeding out from the esophagus because of the altered circulation caused by this chronic high level infection. So that's a really awful scary story, and it does not happen often but that's one of the causes of deaths associated with schistosomiasis.\"\n\nThe disease is so under-researched that there isn't even good data on exactly how many people are suffering or dying from schistosomiasis. The World Health Organization estimates that schistosomiasis kills between 25,000 and 200,000 people a year.\n\nIt's possible that some simple treatments like wormwood tea could help combat it. But the first challenge may be to stop neglecting this potentially fatal disease."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/06/681982396/a-guide-to-whos-who-in-house-leadership-for-the-116th-congress", "text": "A Guide To Who's Who In House Leadership For The 116th Congress\n\nThe 116th Congress officially convened on Thursday with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years. And with Democrats' newfound power and Republicans' first time in the minority in nearly a decade, both parties saw a shuffle in their leadership teams.\n\nThe Democratic leadership is a diverse slate, representing the record number of women and minorities their new caucus brings to Capitol Hill \u2014 Nancy Pelosi is resuming her place as the first female House speaker in history, with four other top positions either being filled by a woman or person of color.\n\nRepublicans, however, have a leadership slate made up almost entirely of white males.\n\nHere's who you need to know in House leadership for both parties in the new Congress:\n\nDemocrats\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP; Mandel Ngan/AFP (2); Drew Angerer; Zach Gibson/AFP; Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP; Mandel Ngan/AFP (2); Drew Angerer; Zach Gibson/AFP; Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nPelosi made history as the first woman speaker ever when she took the gavel in 2007. Now, she retakes it again 12 years later, also making her the first speaker to reclaim the position in more than six decades.\n\nThe San Francisco lawmaker has had her detractors, and many incoming freshmen in swing district campaigned on new leadership. On Thursday, fifteen in her caucus either voted for someone else or simply voted present. Still, those defections were much fewer than the 78-year-old feared last fall, showcasing her deal-making prowess that even many Republicans privately praise her for.\n\nShe'll have to manage a caucus with diverging opinions and a vocal progressive wing, and have to grapple with a Republican Senate \u2014 something she didn't have to contend with during her first tenure. And, of course, plenty of clashes with President Trump also likely await. First on the agenda: trying to find an end to the partial government shutdown, with Pelosi pledging not to budge on funding for the wall on the southern border with Mexico that Trump says is a requirement before he will sign spending measures that would end the shutdown.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.\n\nThe 79-year-old Hoyer also resumed the same post he had during Democrats' last turn in the majority, moving up from serving as minority whip for the past eight years.\n\nPelosi and Hoyer have a had a long, sometimes testy, relationship. She hails from the legendary Maryland D'Alesandro political family, but that hasn't always endeared the two to each other, though they've denied any friction in recent years. Pelosi first beat Hoyer for whip in 2001 and she backed a challenger to Hoyer for majority leader when Democrats last took control in 2006.\n\nAs The New York Times, recently wrote, the \"Pelosi-Hoyer frenemies dynamic, long a subject of intrigue in the Capitol, is growing ever more complex\" as they're back in power together. But Hoyer has been a political survivor. He's the longest-serving current Democrat in the House, first elected in 1981. Hoyer is also the only white male in the top ranks of Democratic leadership.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C.\n\nThe 78-year-old Clyburn is the highest-ranking African-American lawmaker in Congress. He served as whip when Democrats had the majority from 2007 until 2011, and then served as assistant House Democratic leader while Democrats were in the minority \u2014 a post Pelosi created especially for him when Hoyer and Clyburn were competing against each other after the 2010 elections. When Democrats were last in the majority, Clyburn served as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nIt wasn't lost on many Democrats this year, though, that the trio at the top of the leadership ranks are all in their late seventies. And there's a proposal Pelsoi has backed to change that, term-limiting the top three spots to bring change over the next few years.\n\nAssistant Speaker, Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M.\n\nLujan was awarded this No. 4 post after leading the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the past two cycles, resulting in a 40-seat gain in November and Democrats flipping control of the chamber. The position makes the 46-year-old the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, and part of a new generation of potential Democratic leaders once the top three leaders eventually step aside.\n\nDemocratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.\n\nJeffries narrowly defeated California Rep. Barbara Lee in caucus elections in November to claim the No. 5 leadership post. Some of Lee's allies claimed sexism and ageism in the vote, and criticized Jeffries as too centrist. Still, the victory set up the 48-year-old New York lawmaker, once called \"Brooklyn's Barack Obama,\" as a possible speaker of the House one day, which would make him the first black Speaker in history if that happens. And his addition means there's another African-American in Democratic leadership.\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos, D-Ill.\n\nBustos has the tough task of protecting Democrats' newfound majority, but she brings credentials to the table unlike the others atop leadership \u2014 she represents a somewhat rural Illinois district that Trump narrowly carried, not unlike many of the seats Democrats will have to defend in 2020. A political protege of Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the centrist lawmaker even got four votes for speaker from incoming moderate Democratic freshmen.\n\nRepublicans\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Aaron P. Bernstein; Stephen Maturen; Mandel Ngan/AFP; Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Aaron P. Bernstein; Stephen Maturen; Mandel Ngan/AFP; Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nThe 53-year-old California lawmaker would have far preferred the title of \"Speaker\" following Paul Ryan's retirement, but now he will have to learn how to maneuver being in the minority for the first time in eight years. McCarthy defeated House Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan of Ohio to win the top GOP post, and he should still expect to try to contend with a vocal conservative minority within the caucus \u2014 issues that plagued both of his predecessors. He's endeared himself to Trump (reportedly even keeping his favorite Starburst flavors on hand), and McCarthy's relationship with the president will be worth watching as Trump tries to win re-election and Republicans try to win back control of the House.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.\n\nScalise keeps the same role he's held since 2014, albeit this time for the minority party. The 53-year-old Louisiana lawmaker survived a near-fatal shooting attempt in June 2017 after a man opened fire during a congressional baseball game practice, and had continued rehabilitation. \"I had miracles. I had angels,\" he would later tell Politico about the assassination attempt. Scalise unanimously won the whip spot again when Republicans held leadership elections in November.\n\nRepublican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.\n\nThe 52-year-old Wyoming lawmaker assumes the No. 3 House GOP leadership post more than three decades after it was once held by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. She's the highest-ranking woman in GOP leadership, and assumed the position after Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers decided not to seek another term in the party's leadership ranks. The political scion was first elected in 2016 and didn't make much noise during her first term, but now she could become one of the GOP's most visible faces, especially as Republicans try to counter a large number of new freshmen women Democrats.\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer, R-Minn.\n\nEmmer has to try to find a way to win back the 18 seats Republicans need to regain control of the House in 2020. He takes the position after serving as a deputy NRCC chair during the 2018 cycle. There could be divergent views within the caucus on how to do that, though. He's already gotten in a flap with New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who said she'd help more GOP women win in primaries next year. After Emmer said it would be a \"mistake\" for Stefanik to try to intervene in primaries, she hit back, saying \"I wasn't asking for permission.\"\n\nAlso on the GOP leadership team are Republican Conference Secretary Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer, R-Ala."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/04/682444535/jonben-t-ramseys-brother-settles-defamation-lawsuit-with-cbs", "text": "JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey's Brother Settles Defamation Lawsuit With CBS\n\nBurke Ramsey, the brother of child beauty-pageant queen JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, who was killed more than 22 years ago, settled a defamation lawsuit against CBS Corp. and several others on Friday, his lawyer told NPR.\n\nRamsey, who was 9 years old at the time of the grisly killing, sued CBS in 2016 after the network aired a two-day documentary series that included the theory that the boy had slain his 6-year-old sister.\n\nBurke's attorney, Lin Wood, told NPR in an email that the lawsuit has \"been amicably settled to the satisfaction of all parties.\"\n\n\"For almost 20 years, it has been my privilege to represent John Ramsey, Patsy Ramsey (before her untimely death in 2006) and their son, Burke in a number of defamation lawsuits,\" Wood said. \"It is now my professional and personal wish for this family that they no longer suffer the pain of false accusations in the future.

In 2008, Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy, formally apologized to the family in a letter, saying neither the parents nor the son were considered suspects. Lacy added that new DNA evidence, unavailable in 1996, pointed to an unknown male as JonBen\u00e9t's killer.\n\n\"To the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime, I am deeply sorry,\" Lacy wrote.\n\nNo one has been charged in the case, and the investigation is still open.\n\nRamsey's lawsuit against CBS; Critical Content, the production company behind the four-hour documentary; and seven others involved, including James Kolar, author of Foreign Faction, a book that posited JonBen\u00e9t's brother as the killer, noted that he had never voluntarily participated in any media or public interviews concerning his sister's death until he learned of the project.\n\n\"In September of [2016], following decades of silence and only after learning that CBS was planning to broadcast a JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey show based on Foreign Faction in which it would accuse him of killing JonBen\u00e9t, Burke exercised his right of reasonable response by granting one interview to Dr. Phil McGraw in which he denied any involvement in JonBen\u00e9t's murder,\" the complaint reads.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2000, Ramsey sued several publications and networks for publishing material accusing him of committing the crime.

Patrick Riordan said at a news conference that as many as eight people were injured and taken to local hospitals in what he called an \"extensive\" and fiery wreck.\n\nAt about 3:40 p.m. ET, a semitruck and a car traveling north along Interstate 75 near Gainesville collided, crashed through the center guardrails and smashed into a southbound semitruck and a church van carrying the children. The trucks burst into flames. Another car then slammed into the wreckage.\n\nThe children ranged in age from 9- to 14-years-old and were traveling from Avoyelles Parish in central Louisiana, according to the highway patrol. In a Facebook post, Kevin Cox of the Louisiana district of the United Pentecostal Church International said the van was carrying members of its Marksville, La., congregation. Nine children were in the van at the time of the accident, as were three adult women.\n\n\"One of the ladies is pregnant and 'pretty banged up',\" Cox said. \"But doctors have been able to keep her and her unborn baby stabilized.\"\n\nAmong the children who died was the granddaughter of the congregation's pastor, Eric Descant. His wife was seriously injured in the crash. The four surviving children all sustained injuries but are expected to recover, Cox said.\n\n\"It's just beyond belief,\" Marksville Mayor John Lemoine told the Ocala Star-Banner. \"We are a small community with 6,500 people in town. ... It's affected everybody. That is what's so terrible about this.\"\n\nThe drivers of the two semitrucks, both adult males, were also killed. Officials say they don't yet know what caused the wreck and have opened an investigation. The driver of the truck involved in the first part of the accident had received multiple tickets in the past decade, including for speeding and driving an unsafe vehicle, according to the Associated Press.\n\nVideo from the scene showed bodies and debris strewn across the roadway as thick smoke billowed from the burning wreck.\n\nYouTube\n\n\"We kept seeing these little explosions and fire,\" Nicole Towarek, who witnessed the crash, told The Associated Press. \"The heat, it was insane.\"\n\nDozens of gallons of spilled diesel fuel fed a giant fire that damaged the roadway itself, according to the AP.

NTSB investigators won't be able to start an examination of the crash until the government reopens, King reports.\n\n\"It's unbelievable. Everybody is in shock,\" Maxine Doughty, a member of the Marksville congregation, told the Star-Banner. \"We had our Last Supper Sunday and the pastor said to live our lives like each day is the last day.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/01/05/680528912/how-a-mongolian-heavy-metal-band-got-millions-of-youtube-views", "text": "How A Mongolian Heavy Metal Band Got Millions Of YouTube Views\n\nYouTube\n\nA band from Mongolia that blends the screaming guitars of heavy metal and traditional Mongolian guttural singing has picked up 7 million views for its two videos.\n\nLeather jackets, skull rings and bandannas alongside intricately carved Mongolian horsehead fiddles are just some of the images in the first two music videos the Mongolian band The Hu released on YouTube this fall. Excited listeners from around the globe have posted comments like: \"This makes me want to ride a horse and shoot people with a bow\" and \"This sounds like ancient mongol rock of 1000 b.c. Really badass!\" (sic)\n\nYouTube\n\nAnd yet what The Hu is doing, while new, comes out of a tradition that began several decades ago when Mongolia transitioned from a satellite of the Soviet Union to a democracy.\n\nAs the Soviet Union crumbled and Western influence flooded in during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mongolian musicians chose to preserve Mongolian culture while also adapting new influences, explains University of Chicago ethnomusicology doctoral student Thalea Stokes.\n\nIt is something they continue to do today, says Stokes, who spoke via Skype from Inner Mongolia where she is studying Mongolian hip-hop. That hip-hop scene has a similar background. Although hip-hop is a relatively new import, Mongolians have rapidly adapted it, mixing \"fierce ethnic pride and adventurous dancing\" with social and political critique, according to Stokes' research.\n\n\"Mongolians are not just taking elements from Western music and just copying and pasting,\" says Stokes. Instead, they're using some of these elements and making their own authentic music.\n\n\"So it's not rock music performed by Mongolians. It's Mongolian rock music,\" she says.\n\nMongolian rock combines traditional Mongolian instruments, like a horsehead fiddle (morin khuur), Jew's harp (tumur khuur) and Mongolian guitar (tovshuur) with the pounding bass and drums of rock.\n\nIt also involves singing in a guttural way known as throat singing while throwing heads back and forth reminiscent of the headbanging of '80s heavy metal bands like Metallica. Those who study Mongolian music believe one reason The Hu has proved so popular with outsiders is this combining of modern and historical and Eastern and Western elements.\n\nThe Hu call their style \"hunnu rock\" \u2014 from the Mongolian root word for human being: \"hu.\" The band spent seven years putting together its first album, which it expects to release this spring. They plan to call it Gereg, the name for a diplomatic passport used during the time of Genghis Khan. For the album, the idea was to find, study and incorporate as much of Mongolia's musical culture as they could into a rock style, says the band's 52-year-old producer and songwriter, B. Dashdondog, who goes by \"Dashka.\"\n\nMongolian musical culture is tied up with their pastoral way of life. The two-stringed horsehead fiddle is shaped to resemble a horse and includes the carving of a horse head and strings and bow made of horsehair. It produces a sound similar to a violin and can be used to imitate the sound of a herd of horses. In throat singing, associated with pastoral herders in Central Asia, the singer produces a low constant sort of drone at the same time as a series of higher tones.\n\n\"We wanted to come up with our own thing that we can offer to this big music family. Make something new,\" says Dashka, who spoke through a translator via Skype.\n\nIt is not just their instruments that incorporate traditional elements. In the band's first song, \"Yuve Yuve Yu\" (What's going on?), they mention Genghis Khan and how he was fated to bring nations together. The video begins with images of people inside playing video games, watching television and looking at their phones. A door is opened and the band's four members step into different natural settings: cliffs, desert, forest and lake. The message they hope to convey through their lyrics and imagery is that people need to pay attention to nature and their history and culture, explains lead singer TS. Galbadrakh, known as \"Gala,\" 29.\n\nIt is a familiar message to Kip Hutchins, a doctoral student in cultural anthropology at the University of Wisconsin. Lines about neglecting their ancestors \u2014 like \"taking our great Mongol ancestors names in vain\" \u2014 are almost exactly what was sung in the late 1980s during the transition to democracy, says Hutchins. It was then that rock became popular as a form of political protest. Soon after, Mongolians started to form folk rock and folk jazz ensembles. Band members tended to be trained in conservatories on traditional instruments.\n\nThe four members of The Hu all learned to play traditional Mongolian instruments at the Mongolian State conservatory. The oldest in the group, G. Nyamjantsan, who goes by \"Jaya,\" 35, still teaches at the conservatory. N. Temuulen aka \"Temka,\" 28, who plays the Mongolian guitar, says their international popularity was something they expected \u2014 but not in the millions. The fourth band member is B. Enkhsaikhan, known as \"Enkush,\" who is a throat singer and a horsehead fiddle player.\n\n\"When we do this, we try to spiritually express this beautiful thing about Mongolian music. We think we will talk to everyone's soul through our music,\" says Temka through a translator. \"But we didn't expect this fast, people just popping up everywhere.\"\n\nThey aren't quite sure how it happened. Hutchins has an idea. He believes part of the appeal of bands like The Hu is the way he believes the story of Mongolia has been written in the West. Nomadism and horse culture has been romanticized, and the emphasis on freedom and heroes tends to appeal to the stereotypical male heavy metal fan.\n\n\"There is a kind of exoticism to Mongolia,\" says Hutchins. Mongolia \"is at once a community and a culture that is part of Asia and Europe at the same time.\"\n\nThe Hu is not the only Mongolian band that has attracted recent international attention. There is the folk rock band Altan Urag, whose music was featured in the 2007 film Mongol and in the Netflix show Marco Polo, and the Inner Mongolian Hanggai Band.\n\nEthnomusicologist Charlotte D'Evelyn sees The Hu as trying to bring back traditions while also modernizing. For her, it is as if the band is saying, \"We're still modern and we're living in the modern world. But we're using this music to revive some kind of nationalistic cultural identity.\"\n\nHutchins puts it another way.\n\n\"The Hu is obviously interested in teaching a global community about Mongolian culture as much as they're interested in creating something Mongol.\"\n\nKatya Cengel is the author of Exiled: From the Killing Fields of Cambodia to California and Back.

Rachel Martin talks to Saenz about what has changed since Trump became president.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nCongressional leaders have been invited back to the White House today, but both sides are dug in to their positions, so there aren't a lot of expectations for a breakthrough to end the partial government shutdown. President Trump is demanding $5 billion in funding for his wall on the Mexican border. House Democrats, meanwhile, passed legislation yesterday which would keep border security funding at 1.3 billion. For the president, this is an issue that has been a priority since the early days of his campaign. A month after then-candidate Donald Trump announced he was running, in 2015, he traveled to the border city of Laredo, in Texas, to deliver this message.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In certain sections, you have to have a wall. Absolutely.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: And, by the way, the wall - the wall will save you a tremendous amount of money. But you absolutely - there are areas that you have to have the wall.\n\nMARTIN: The mayor of Laredo, Peter Saenz (ph), welcomed then-candidate Trump at the time.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPETE SAENZ: We're excited to have Mr. Donald Trump here in Laredo, Texas. It has provided us an opportunity to present to Mr. Trump and his entourage what Laredo's all about.\n\nMARTIN: We wanted to learn how the border debate looks from Laredo, so we have called up Mayor Saenz to talk with us this morning. Thanks so much for being with us.\n\nSAENZ: Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much for invitation, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: Before we move to the present moment, I wonder if you could walk us back to when candidate Trump visited Laredo back in the day when he was running for president. You were able to tell him about the border issues that were facing your city. What did you describe to him?\n\nSAENZ: What we did, we described, basically, what Laredo's all about. And we're the No. 1 land port in the entire Americas. We're the No. 2 port, behind Long Beach, as a port, overall port. We do over $200 billion worth of trade, primarily with Mexico. We have a strong relationship - economic and beyond - with Mexico, and this is why it's so sensitive for us here at the border as to how we deal with Mexico. Particularly, trade, you know, in general because we are a logistics warehousing distribution center...\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nSAENZ: ...An important center. We add and bring value to the state of Texas, but, of course, the nation as well. And so...\n\nMARTIN: What did you tell him about the wall? Did you agree with him that a wall was a good idea or a bad idea?\n\nSAENZ: (Laughter) Well, he asked. And, of course, we told him - he was insisting on this physical wall, and we told him that given the terrain and how the lay of the land there - you know, we have a network of creeks and waterways that actually empty into the river. And it's a rolling topography. It doesn't necessarily lend itself engineering-wise, I think, it doesn't lend itself for a physical wall.\n\nAnd I think at that time - and I think you showed, or at least, you presented a part of that interview - he did concede that maybe through natural barriers, that those could serve as a barrier, as well. So but then again, he's been changing his mind on the size and type of fence, or barrier, or wall or whatever.\n\nSo anyway, our position there in Laredo is we don't need a physical wall. We have a natural barrier. And we expressed that to him. We consistently kept that position. I'm also the chairman of the Texas Border Coalition, which is really mayors and judges from Brownsville to El Paso, and consistently, we've kept that policy. You know, we could do without a physical wall. We're very much for border security. Believe us. We need border security.\n\nMARTIN: That means more agents, better technology, things like that.\n\nSAENZ: Yeah. We're proposing this virtual wall concept, which now through technology, more personnel - frankly, we work very closely. We're not a sanctuary city. We work very closely with the federal people there, all agencies, and it's our plan to continue with them. And also clearing the vegetation. We have dense vegetation there by the river banks. And working with Mexico, I personally have a very good, strong relationship with the mayor of Nuevo Laredo, who's our counterpart there at the Laredo port. And they're very open to cooperation, and their willingness to help out on these border issues...\n\nMARTIN: Yeah. Let me ask you - so you say you don't need a wall. President Trump insists that you do. You are actually not in Texas at this moment. We're talking to you from Washington, D.C. You are here talking with lawmakers about the border issue. Can you tell us who you've spoken with and what those conversations have been like? Is your message getting through?\n\nSAENZ: I think so. Or, at least, the attempt is very strong for us. We obviously visited with the people there in Texas - Senator Cornyn, Senator Cruz and our congressman, Henry Cuellar. We've been visiting with other new senators and congresspeople that were coming in just to impress on them, you know, the need. President Trump also stated as part of his leveraging momentum here for the wall is that he wanted to close the border.\n\nAnd, of course, that would be catastrophic for us as a community, but also our state, state of Texas, and the nation. Millions of jobs depend on cross-border trade and commerce, and we've got to be very careful as to how we approach these things. I would prefer that that type of rhetoric is kept out because it does create all sorts of uncertainty in the markets, and more so in the trade business.\n\nMARTIN: Just lastly, the president has asked the Pentagon to deploy troops to the border to build or upgrade existing fencing. Do you think that's a good idea? Do you need that?\n\nSAENZ: Not in our area. Maybe in other areas. You know, there's got to be a solution to it, but it's got to be practical. And it's got to be, you know, effective and physically responsible. We personally feel that money could be applied somewhere else. So, you know, we're expecting good things, hopefully in the near future.\n\nMARTIN: Mayor Pete Saenz of Laredo, Texas. Thank you so much.\n\nSAENZ: Yes, ma'am. Thank you for the time.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

After years of deadly errors and safety violations, the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy, a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell NPR.\n\nAll net proceeds from the sale of PG&E's gas division would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires, the sources said. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe company also is exploring selling key real estate assets, including its San Francisco headquarters, and moving its operations elsewhere in the Bay Area, the sources say.\n\nOn Friday, the company announced it would be\"reviewing structural options\" to best position the company to meet customer and operational needs. In addition, PG&E said it is searching for new directors for its board to \"augment its existing expertise in safety.\"\n\nPG&E declined to make any senior leaders available to comment on Project Falcon. A written statement from spokesman Andy Castagnola said, \"Safety is and will continue to be our top priority as we work to determine the best path forward for all of our stakeholders. PG&E remains fully committed to helping our customers and the affected communities recover and rebuild \u2014 and to doing everything we can to reduce the risk of future wildfires.\"\n\nWildfire damages\n\nIn June, the state's fire agency, Cal Fire, determined that PG&E power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across Northern California in 2017. And now, regulators are investigating whether PG&E equipment sparked November's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in state history.\n\nThe company could end up having to pay billions from legal action stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons.\n\nEquity analysts project that PG&E's damages from the wildfires could exceed PG&E's market value and its insurance coverage. One Citigroup analyst estimates the company could be on the hook for up to $15 billion in damages.\n\nInsurance companies Allstate, State Farm and USAA have filed lawsuits against PG&E, blaming the utility for the Camp Fire.\n\nThe gas sale strategy would have to be approved by the state regulatory agency, the California Public Utilities Commission, which has already expressed deep concerns about PG&E's shoddy safety record, lack of transparency and past efforts to pass liability costs on to the state's ratepayers.\n\nSo far, state regulators and lawmakers have been kept out of PG&E's planning loop for Project Falcon, named for a group of peregrine falcons nesting on the roof of the company's headquarters.\n\nThe current and former PG&E officials say they're speaking with NPR out of concern that senior management is not acting in the best interests of ratepayers, safety and the state. \"There's a public trust element in being a utility monopoly,\" said the senior company official.\n\nBailout?\n\nPG&E is under no legal obligation to disclose its internal discussions about ways to stave off bankruptcy. But given the potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout, Michael Wara, a lawyer and research scholar at Stanford University, calls the lack of transparency \"extremely disappointing.\"\n\n\"They need to be thinking very hard about how to create safety for Californians rather than how to make money for shareholders when they're not being totally transparent, especially in the current context where there's a lack of trust and so many people that have been harmed by PG&E's infrastructure,\" Wara said.\n\nWhat California urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. And it's hard to see that going on.\n\nWara added, \"What California urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. And it's hard to see that going on.\"\n\nWall Street wants to see hard thinking, too.\n\nSteve Fleishman, senior utilities analyst and a managing director at Wolfe Research, said PG&E's plan for dealing with fires in the future is unclear. \"They clearly seem to be more at risk for that,\" Fleishman said. \"This kind of risk profile is not sustainable.\"\n\nPG&E's stock is down about 50 percent since the Camp Fire broke out on Nov. 8.\n\nConsumer watchdog groups want any big move done with transparency.\n\n\"Anything PG&E wants to propose should be done in an open, public manner and include a comprehensive, coherent wildfire mitigation strategy,\" says Mark Toney, the executive director of The Utility Reform Network.\n\nThere is widespread anger in the state over PG&E's shoddy safety record. Protests broke out at recent public oversight meetings and at the company's San Francisco headquarters, where environmentalists and activists read the names of the more than 100 people combined who died in the Camp Fire and 2017's wildfires in Napa and Sonoma counties. At one customer service center, the company has installed bulletproof glass.\n\n'Serious safety problems'\n\nIn late December, state regulators said they were considering several proposals in response to ongoing concerns about the utility's role in a deadly gas explosion in 2010 and in the more recent wildfires.\n\n\"PG&E has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years,\" the California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement.\n\nPossible changes put forth by the commission include splitting up the gas and electric divisions and either making the company a public utility or making the company's return on equity contingent on safety performance.\n\n\"We must be careful and practical,\" the commission's president, Michael Picker, said in a statement last month. \"This process will be like repairing a jetliner while it's in flight. Crashing a plane to make it safer isn't good for the passengers.\"\n\nThe commission declined further comment for this story. A spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility.\n\nWe must be careful and practical. This process will be like repairing a jetliner while it's in flight. Crashing a plane to make it safer isn't good for the passengers.\n\nIn a separate development, the state's top law enforcement official, Attorney General Xavier Becerra, said in a court filing in late December that PG&E could face criminal charges up to murder if it's found liable in any of the recent deadly California wildfires.\n\nPG&E was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a San Francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood. The federal judge overseeing the utility's five-year criminal probation in that case had asked Becerra's opinion on whether PG&E's possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation.\n\nThe stakes\n\nA sale would have big implications for the company, which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million California households and has more than 20,000 employees. PG&E's natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company.\n\nThe company sources who spoke to NPR and provided supporting documents say the planning for Project Falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past June, when Cal Fire determined that PG&E was responsible for at least a dozen Northern California fires. The planning, the sources say, has accelerated since the Camp Fire.\n\nThe sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators.\n\nCalifornia applies \"inverse condemnation\" to utilities, meaning they can be held liable for damage even if they are not found negligent.\n\nStructuring the deal\n\nPG&E shareholders and institutional investors may welcome a gas sale as a way to cover, at least in part, wildfire liabilities.\n\nAs part of the gas sale plan, all gross proceeds from the sale would go into the wildfire fund with \"no direct shareholder benefit from cash,\" according to the PG&E source. But shareholders could get new shares in the company that purchases the gas arm.\n\nRegulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers.\n\n\"We need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale,\" warns Wara, the Stanford researcher.\n\nThe inside sources say the company is hoping to get between $10.7 billion and $15.5 billion for its gas assets. Given the company's safety, liability and political challenges \u2014 including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations \u2014 analysts say it's not at all clear they would get that on the open market.\n\nIn mid-December, state regulators found that PG&E had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five-year period.\n\nAt the time, PG&E spokesman Matt Nauman said in an emailed statement to NPR that the company is \"committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record-keeping, and we didn't live up to that commitment in this case.\"\n\nThis comes on the heels of a $1.6 billion fine from regulators \u2014 the largest in state history \u2014 and six felony convictions related to 2010 San Bruno explosion.\n\nTravis Miller, senior utilities equity strategist at Morningstar, is skeptical that a potential gas sell-off would fly with regulators or Wall Street. He said he doesn't think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets.\n\n\"You may get a good price, but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk,\" Miller says. \"There's no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders, either.\"\n\nProject Falcon and the Camp Fire\n\nThe company's fiscal woes deepened in the wake of November's Camp Fire in Butte County, Calif., which killed at least 85 people and displaced tens of thousands who continue to face a desperate housing crisis. Paradise and neighboring towns were all but wiped out.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state's fire agency Cal Fire. PG&E has told state regulators that it experienced problems on two sections of its electric system near where the Camp Fire erupted.\n\nThe company faces nearly two dozen lawsuits from fire victims over its possible culpability for the Camp Fire, including allegations of possible equipment failures and poor maintenance. In one lawsuit, residents accuse the company of prioritizing advertising spending over fire and public safety.\n\n\"Now it's clear there are problems on both sides of the business,\" says Steve Fleishman, an analyst with Wolfe Research, referring to the gas and electric divisions.\n\nFleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow PG&E leaders to focus solely on improving safety. \"I think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety,\" Fleishman says.\n\nAnalysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital, not just because of present liability, but also because of the risk of future catastrophic fires, a specter sharpened by climate change and a century of fire suppression policy in the nation's forests.\n\nThe company in November said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines. And the ratings agencies, Moody's Investor Service and S&P, have downgraded the company's credit rating to near \"junk\" status.\n\nApproval process will be complicated\n\nInternal PG&E planning documents on the potential sale, labeled \"privileged and confidential,\" show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval.\n\n\"The CPUC approval process will be complicated and lengthy, so phasing the proceeding to obtain early decisions on matters that are crucial to the viability of the transaction is desirable,\" one document reads.\n\nWhile the gas sale would cover some liabilities, the legislature also may be asked to step in. State lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout.\n\nAnalysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond, putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook.\n\n\"Ultimately, we're going to be left holding the bag,\" says Michael Wara of Stanford University. \"If PG&E can't pay all of these costs, then it's the California taxpayer that ultimately will.\"\n\nBut some lawmakers are already balking.\n\nState Sen. Bill Dodd, who originally supported shielding PG&E from liability costs related to fires in 2017, has lost patience with the company.\n\n\"PG&E has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across California,\" Dodd said in an emailed statement. He called for \"systemic change, which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/01/03/681941779/scientists-have-hacked-photosynthesis-in-search-of-more-productive-crops", "text": "Scientists Have 'Hacked Photosynthesis' In Search Of More Productive Crops\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Haley Ahlers/RIPE Project Haley Ahlers/RIPE Project\n\nThere's a big molecule, a protein, inside the leaves of most plants. It's called Rubisco, which is short for an actual chemical name that's very long and hard to remember.\n\nAmanda Cavanagh, a biologist and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Illinois, calls herself a big fan of Rubisco. \"It's probably the most abundant protein in the world,\" she says. It's also super-important.\n\ntoggle caption Claire Benjamin/RIPE Project\n\nRubisco has one job. It picks up carbon dioxide from the air, and it uses the carbon to make sugar molecules. It gets the energy to do this from the sun. This is photosynthesis, the process by which plants use sunlight to make food, a foundation of life on Earth. Yay for Rubisco!\n\n\"But it has what we like to call one fatal flaw,\" Cavanagh continues. Unfortunately, Rubisco isn't picky enough about what it grabs from the air. It also picks up oxygen. \"When it does that, it makes a toxic compound, so the plant has to detoxify it.\"\n\nPlants have a whole complicated chemical assembly line to carry out this detoxification, and the process uses up a lot of energy. This means the plant has less energy for making leaves, or food for us. (There is a family of plants, including corn and sugar cane, that developed another type of workaround for Rubisco, and those plants are much more productive.)\n\nCavanagh and her colleagues in a research program called Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency (RIPE), which is based at the University of Illinois, have spent the last five years trying to fix Rubisco's problem. \"We're sort of hacking photosynthesis,\" she says.\n\nThey experimented with tobacco plants, just because tobacco is easy to work with. They inserted some new genes into these plants, which shut down the existing detoxification assembly line and set up a new one that's way more efficient. And they created super tobacco plants. \"They grew faster, and they grew up to 40 percent bigger\" than normal tobacco plants, Cavanagh says. These measurements were done both in greenhouses and open-air field plots.\n\nThe scientists now are trying to do the same thing with plants that people actually rely on for food, like tomatoes and soybeans. They also working with cowpeas, or black-eyed peas, \"because it's a staple food crop for a lot of farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, which is where our funders are interested in making the biggest impact,\" Cavanagh says.\n\nThe funders of this project include the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Disclosure: The Gates Foundation also funds NPR.) The USDA has applied for a patent on plants that are engineered in this way.\n\nCavanagh and her colleagues published their work this week in the journal Science. Maureen Hanson, who is carrying out similar research on photosynthesis at Cornell University, was impressed.\n\n\"This is a very important finding,\" she says. \"It's really the first major breakthrough showing that one can indeed engineer photosynthesis and achieve a major increase in crop productivity.\"\n\nIt will be many years, though, before any farmers plant crops with this new version of photosynthesis. Researchers will have to find out whether it means that a food crop like soybeans actually produces more beans \u2014 or just more stalks and leaves.\n\nThen they'll need to convince government regulators and consumers that the crops are safe to grow and eat."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/03/681845442/thursday-january-3rd-2019", "text": "Thursday, January 3rd, 2019\n\nDemocrats take control of the House today.

All they do is process peas, lentils and garbanzo beans. Most of the time, most of it goes overseas. The trouble started earlier this year with the U.S. pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Then came President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. China and India are the two largest buyers of American garbanzos, peas and lentils. In the ag business, they're called pulse crops. Those exports have all but stopped because China and India put big tariffs on American pulse crops. And other countries are holding off on buying them, too, while the prices are unstable.\n\nTIM MCGREEVY: Agriculture has taken the brunt of these trade agreements, these trade disputes.\n\nKING: That's Tim McGreevy. He heads the American Pulse Association from Moscow, Idaho. We looked at a map together. The areas where pulse crops grow are largely red states. McGreevy says it would make sense if countries hit with Trump's tariffs wanted to hit his supporters back.\n\nMCGREEVY: And I think that is by design, right? The question I think is, just how long can agriculture survive if these trade disputes don't get resolved?\n\nKING: McGreevy checks on it all the time in meetings in D.C. with his staff, the ag secretary and members of Congress. But there's been no action. Dried pulse crops can sit in the bin for years and keep their nutritional value, but most of these farmers need the cash from fall's crop to live on and to stay in business.

She heard it on the radio. She played it in local orchestras as a student. The Center for Black Music Research is in Chicago. So, when the violinist recorded her first concerto album in 1997, she naturally included music by Afro-Caribbean and Afro-European composers.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking about any of the social justice aspect or anything like that,\" Pine says. \"But after the record came out, I started getting a huge number of requests from students and parents and teachers about, you know, 'Where can I find repertoire like this for kids of different levels?' \"\n\nSo she began a nearly 20-year quest to catalog as much of this music as she could find. She had some time on her hands: Two years earlier, she was caught in a closing Chicago train door and dragged 200 feet. She lost one leg and severely damaged the other, and had more than 40 surgeries. But during the long recovery process, she devoted some of her spare time to searching for music.\n\n\"You know, going to the Library of Congress and digging up the one copy of this and that, and going to the Haiti music archives in Montreal. Going to the attic of the composer's grandniece to sort through unsorted boxes of papers and manuscripts. I mean, there have been some amazing archaeological adventures,\" she says.\n\nOne of the pieces she found was a 1927 work called \"Levee Dance,\" by the Tennessee-born composer Clarence Cameron White. It's one of the pieces that Pine has recorded for a new album called Blues Dialogues, for violin and piano.\n\nYouTube\n\n\"My parents would put on Chicago blues records when they weren't playing the classical station when I was growing up, and it's just sort of been in the air,\" she says. \"I mean, I really consider it to be my indigenous music \u2014 of, you know, of where I live.\"\n\nAnother of the composers featured on that album is Billy Childs \u2014 a Grammy-winning Los Angeles-based composer and pianist. Childs got a cold dose of how the classical establishment felt about composers of color when he went to the University of Southern California to study classical composition, with a side of jazz performance.\n\n\"It seemed as though, often, I wouldn't be taken as seriously as a composer steeped in the European tradition of music because of my jazz background,\" Childs says. \"But that also had kind of a racial overtone to it.\"\n\nIt's this attitude that Pine is trying to change with her Music by Black Composers project. She's working with the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, the Dallas Symphony's Young Strings program and Project STEP in Boston to introduce young musicians to composers and works that Billy Childs had to find on his own.\n\n\"Alvin Singleton is really great, you know?\" Childs says. \"I love Bill Banfield's work. Jessie Montgomery is a great composer. Valerie Coleman. Tania Le\u00f3n. One of my favorite pieces ever written is by George Walker, and it's a trombone concerto.\"\n\nAll of those composers are part of Pine's free online database, which includes more than 900 works by more than 350 composers from multiple continents. The Music by Black Composers project has also published a new book for beginning violin students, the first in a series \u2014 as well as a coloring book and a timeline poster of around 300 composers.\n\n\"I'm particularly excited to inspire African-American children,\" Pine says \"so that they feel like they're part of classical music's history and future \u2014 but also to normalize diversity of repertoire for all students, so that they grow up with this stuff, and aren't satisfied with having concert experiences, when they grow up to become audience members and performers, that don't reflect the totality of the human experience.\n\nChilds says he's is grateful for the Music by Black Composers project, but he also hopes it helps make projects like it obsolete.\n\n\"The great legacy of music written by African-American composers is not called 'music by African-American composers,' but called 'music by composers,' where the qualifying term doesn't pigeonhole it and relegate it to some corner of the room \u2014 you know, African-Americans over there, and 'regular' composers over here,\" Childs says.\n\n\"I would hope that this project makes that unnecessary, so that we are looking at all music just like Duke Ellington said: good or bad.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/02/679887749/activists-brace-for-2019-abortion-rights-battles-in-the-states", "text": "Activists Brace For 2019 Abortion-Rights Battles In The States\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Barbara Rodriguez/AP Barbara Rodriguez/AP\n\nWith a newly configured U.S. Supreme Court, the stakes are high for abortion-rights battles at the state level.

Wade\n\nMany abortion-rights opponents say they're hoping to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\n\"States want their bill to be the one to go to the Supreme Court. They want to be the one,\" says Sue Liebel, state director for the anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony List.\n\nPossible test cases for Roe already are working their way through the courts \u2014 including an Iowa law banning abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, and one in Mississippi prohibiting the procedure after 15 weeks.\n\nLiebel says anti-abortion-rights activists want to pass similar bills in as many states as possible.\n\n\"So I think they're hopeful; they're energized and rarin' to go,\" Liebel says.\n\nIf Roe were weakened or overturned, more power for regulating abortion would fall to the states. Several anti-abortion-rights groups are pushing to increase the number of states banning abortion after 20 weeks or earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers supportive of abortion rights in several states are sponsoring bills to guarantee the right to abortion in state law, in places including Massachusetts, Virginia and even Texas, according to Smith, with the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\n\"It's unlikely that [Texas] bill will pass,\" Smith says. \"But I think more and more state advocates are bringing up this bill \u2014 either as a messaging vehicle, or to actually get it enacted.\"\n\nBig steps, and small ones\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice America is promoting those bills. But Deputy Policy Director Leslie McGorman says it is also working on incremental efforts to improve abortion access, including legislation allowing a broader range of medical providers \u2014 such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide abortions in more states.\n\n\"We know that as long as abortion is sort of a one-off procedure, or care that's delivered in a standalone clinic and people sort of don't know what it is, that it's gonna be this part of health care that's sort of viewed that way, that's viewed as sort of marginal,\" McGorman says.\n\nAbortion-rights opponents also are continuing to pursue their own incremental strategy.\n\nAmericans United for Life has close to 60 model bills aimed at restricting abortion. Among them is the Abortion Reporting Act, which requires medical providers to submit detailed reports to health officials about abortion-related complications.\n\n\"This is really designed to make sure that women are informed about those abortion providers that are especially dangerous,\" says the group's president, Catherine Glenn Foster.\n\nAbortion-rights advocates say the requirements are intrusive and vaguely defined. Planned Parenthood sued last summer to block a similar law in Idaho.\n\n\"There's also a big push to defund abortion facilities, to stop them from getting Title X funding,\" says Ingrid Duran, of the National Right to Life Committee.\n\nIt's already illegal for federal funds to pay for abortions in most cases, but anti-abortion activists want to ban organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which offer abortions, from receiving any public money for reproductive health services. The Trump administration has proposed blocking such groups from getting funds through Title X, the federal family planning program for low-income people; Duran says similar efforts are underway in many states."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2018/12/31/678416352/chickpeas-sit-in-silos-as-trumps-trade-wars-wage-on", "text": "Chickpeas Sit In Silos As Trump's Trade Wars Wage On\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anna King/Northwest News Network Anna King/Northwest News Network\n\nUpdated at 9:35 a.m. ET Jan. 3\n\nOn a recent rainy day, farmer Allen Druffel stands outside a silo shuffling his feet in the gravel. This co-op bin is where he stores his dried garbanzo beans in the tiny town of Colton, Wash. The place should be busy; trucks should be loading and hauling this year's crop to markets and international ports. But midafternoon, there's just the rain.\n\nSince farmers like Druffel brought in this year's crops, hardly any garbanzos \u2014 or chickpeas \u2014 have moved.\n\n\"Thirty to 40 percent of our total revenue is in the bin,\" Druffel says. \"And we're not sure what we want to do with it.\"\n\nAnd it's bad times for lentils and peas, too. In the agriculture industry, these are all called pulse crops. The largest importers of U.S. pulse crops have slapped tariffs on them, and they've been sitting in silos ever since.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anna King/Northwest News Network Anna King/Northwest News Network\n\nBitter bumper\n\nThe real trouble started in early 2017, with the U.S. pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Late in 2017, India imposed a global tariff on pulse crops and other farm products to protect its own growers. Then came President Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. China and India are the two largest buyers of American garbanzos, peas and lentils, and those exports have all but stopped. Other countries are holding off on buying them, too, while the prices are unstable.\n\nDruffel saw the market drop only when it was too late \u2014 after he had already planted the crop in the spring, and then again after harvest.\n\n\"It was a bit of a roller coaster,\" Druffel says. \"It was one of the best crops we've ever harvested. And then to see the pricing take a 40 to 60 percent fall is really unfortunate. If you're talking real numbers, in February of 2018 I sold chickpeas for 50 cents a pound \u2014 and today they're trading at 18 cents a pound.\"\n\nDirk Hammond is an honest-to-goodness bean counter. He does the accounting at George F. Brocke & Sons, a pulse crop exporter in Kendrick, Idaho.\n\n\"I tell people this year, I feel like I'm the Grinch because of the prices,\" Hammond says. \"And it's, you know, nothing that we as a company, or any grower or landlord has done \u2014 it's just a circumstance of global politics and global trade.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anna King/Northwest News Network Anna King/Northwest News Network\n\nAt Brocke & Sons, high-tech systems sift through the harvest, sorting out the chaff and debris and packaging the pulse crops for shipment around the world. In the deafening facility, robots whiz and whirl, stacking hefty bags of garbanzo beans on wooden pallets.\n\nTo describe this as a bad year for export markets is a gross understatement \u2014 this has been a real catastrophe.\n\nHammond says this year's pulse crops were nearly busting out of the bins. Farmers had plenty of moisture for their dryland or nonirrigated crops. So they had really great quality and yields. And across the nation, farmers planted more garbanzos than ever before \u2014 increasing the acres grown from about 600,000 acres to 800,000.\n\n\"Real catastrophe\"\n\nDown the road in Moscow, Idaho, Tim McGreevy is the head of the American Pulse Association. He represents pulse crop growers across the country.\n\nIn the near 25 years he has held the job, McGreevy says he has never seen such a tough market. He estimates his pulse growers have lost $500 million so far.\n\n\"To describe this as a bad year for export markets is a gross understatement \u2014 this has been a real catastrophe,\" McGreevy says.\n\nAnd if markets don't reopen real soon, it is going to get a lot worse for farmers and processors.\n\nSo far, pulse farmers haven't been awarded much in the way of government payments or help. There are federal loans \u2014 and some farmers will have to take them to keep operating as they hold on to their crops, hoping for better prices by spring.\n\nIn January and February it's the bankers who will largely decide farmers' fates. Most farms have to borrow operating cash for each coming year to buy things like fuel, seeds and chemical fertilizer.\n\nRight now, it's a question of what to plant to make those costs back. Not much in dryland is making money right now. Prices are at or below cost of production in this area for wheat, barley, rapeseed, lentils, garbs and peas.\n\n\"There's not a lot to run right now, that is the absolute truth,\" McGreevy says.\n\nMcGreevy says older farmers might decide to just quit before the next go-round. But young farmers might be giving up the keys to the farm if things don't turn around in a matter of months.\n\n\"Young farmers generally have a lot more debt that they are assuming as they are just starting off in their careers,\" he says. \"If they are purchasing any property, with prices that we are seeing right now, it's very difficult to cash flow that.\"\n\nOn farmer Allen Druffel's remote spread, the dirty-white sky is indistinguishable from the earth. Just a 5 o'clock shadow of wheat stubble bristles out of the snow. Druffel tries to brush off this year's disappointment and his family's risk.\n\n\"No, it doesn't bother me,\" Druffel says in a low voice. \"It's the game we chose to play. I do it 'cause I love it.\"\n\nPressed a bit more, Druffel smiles. Through welling tears, he reluctantly admits:\n\n\"Oh, it hits home.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/02/673986174/xi-urges-peaceful-unification-of-china-and-taiwan-but-wont-rule-out-using-force", "text": "Xi Urges Peaceful Unification Of China And Taiwan, But Won't Rule Out Using Force\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sam Yeh /AFP/Getty Images Sam Yeh /AFP/Getty Images\n\nA Taiwan independent from mainland China is not an option, and no person or party can stop the trend toward \"unification,\" Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a policy speech Wednesday.\n\nWhile Beijing would seek a peaceful \"reunification\" with the self-governing island of over 23.5 million people, The Associated Press reports Xi said China wouldn't rule out using force if necessary. \"We are willing to create a vast space for peaceful unification, but we will never leave any room for any sort of Taiwan independence separatist activities,\" he said speaking at Beijing's Great Hall of the People.\n\nXi went on to say \"independence would only bring profound disaster for Taiwan\" and ensured the island a bright future under a one-country, two- system framework, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Chinese president's urging for the two to come to the table came during a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the \"Message of Compatriots in Taiwan\" when, on Jan. 1, 1979, China offered to open up communications and stop military action against the island. As NPR's Shanghai Correspondent Rob Schmitz has reported previously, Taiwan split from China in 1949 when the U.S.-supported Chinese nationalist leadership fled after losing a civil war to communist forces.\n\nThen-president of Taiwan Chiang Ching-Kuo turned down Beijing's olive branch in 1979, reports Reuters, and later that year came out with the \"Three-Noes Policy\": no contact, no compromise and no negotiation with China.\n\nDecades later, China has again been rebuffed.\n\nIn response to Xi's speech, current president since 2016, Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday that Taiwan would not accept Beijing's offered arrangement of \"one country, two systems,\" reports Reuters. In her own speech just the day before, Tsai, who is member of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, urged China to respect Taiwan's democratic values.\n\nMore than 70 percent of Taiwanese believe Taiwan is already an independent country, according to an analysis done by The Washington Post. Unification with China has also become unpopular, the Post reports only one-third of Taiwanese citizens want to be part of China against \u2014 a drop from 60 percent who supported is in 2003.\n\nOnly about 20 countries across the globe recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation, which means different governments from Latin America to Africa have become drawn into the long-running diplomatic spat over the years. The U.S., which does not recognize Taiwan as independent from China, is no exception. While the State Department says the U.S. enjoys \"a robust unofficial relationship\" with Taiwan, right after his inauguration President Donald Trump called Xi and promised that Washington would stick to the \"One China\" doctrine. Then just a little over a year later, the U.S. dedicated a new complex for the American Institute in Taiwan, which has long functioned as the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan, NPR previously reported.\n\nThough he didn't name any country specifically, Xi warned Wednesday against foreign interference in China's \"Taiwan issue,\" saying family matters should be resolved by family members, reports the AP."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/01/681442539/co-founder-of-time-s-up-legal-defense-fund-reflects-on-first-year-of-action", "text": "Co-Founder Of 'Time's Up' Legal Defense Fund Reflects On First Year Of Action\n\nNPR's Audie Cornish speaks with Fatima Goss Graves. She's co-founder of the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. It was founded in response to the #MeToo movement one year ago today.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nOne year ago today, a full-page letter appeared in The New York Times. It was a response to MeToo and began, dear sisters. It was the start of the Time's Up campaign, founded to fight workplace inequality through the legal system. Since then, multiple states have passed laws to combat sexual harassment, including California. New laws go into effect there today.\n\nEarlier, I spoke with Fatima Goss Graves, co-founder of the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. I asked her on this anniversary why these new laws designed to protect workers' rights are so important.\n\nFATIMA GOSS GRAVES: One of the things that we know is that employers use things like arbitration requirements to prevent workers from accessing justice and that those requirements come as a mere condition of employment before anything terrible has ever happened to you. So doing away with that requirement will be critical.\n\nPeople will be able to choose the pathway that they want for justice. People will be able to ensure that the harassment and violence that they faced doesn't stay in the shadows. And people will be able to push their employers to be better.\n\nCORNISH: So it's the sense that the employers won't have the option to basically bury an allegation by buying off a victim.\n\nGRAVES: One of the things we know is that both arbitration agreements and non-disclosure agreements have been used to keep harassment and violence in the dark, have been used to silence employees. You might think that you are the only one, even though there have been 10 other people who have had very similar experiences. That is going away, and it's going to be important that that goes away.\n\nCORNISH: Looking back on last year, do you think these new laws will make a difference?\n\nGRAVES: When I think about how much has changed in this last year, there's certainly been cultural change. But there have also been a lot of important policy changes. Over 11 states actually changed their laws in some way this year. We aren't done even in those states. And there were over 100 bills introduced in state and local legislatures. So people understood that this was both a longstanding problem but one that they had to get right.\n\nCORNISH: In the meantime, have you gotten a lot of phone calls? Do you think that there are more women out there with more stories to tell?\n\nGRAVES: There is no question that there are people out there who need help and who have stories to tell. We have heard from 4,000 people at the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund over the last year. And that is just the tip of the iceberg, so we really are just getting started.\n\nCORNISH: What kinds of issues are these callers bringing to you?\n\nGRAVES: We hear from people who've experienced harassment in nearly every setting in over 60 different sectors. Sometimes we hear from people who've experienced harassment, and unfortunately, they have no rights because they are way past the statute of limitations, and it took too long to come forward. They have no rights because they are either an independent contractor, or an intern or some other category that isn't covered by federal law and isn't covered in their state, or they have no rights because they work for a very small employer.\n\nWell, if you were a domestic worker, or you're working for a small business, and you are experiencing harassment or violence at work, you still deserve to be able to work with safety and dignity. These are the types of things that we hear from - at the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund all the time. And these are the types of things that we're counting on our policymakers to fix.\n\nCORNISH: When you talk about fixes, what are some other kinds of legislation or policy changes you think could make a difference, given the kinds of calls you've been getting?\n\nGRAVES: Well, certainly we have to make sure we make harassment less secret. So that is the NDAs. That's the arbitration agreements. We need to look at changing our statute of limitations, period. Right now, a year or two years can be too long for many people.\n\nCORNISH: Have you had pushback from employers, businesses, so to speak? And is there an argument from them that says, look, we also need legal protections?\n\nGRAVES: One of the things that's interesting about this moment is that our culture is dramatically outpacing our laws, and businesses know that. Businesses actually - some of them have been making these changes on their own. We've seen some companies just announce that they're doing away with arbitration rules. They're doing away with NDA requirements. They're looking to train their workers and desperate, I think, in some cases for best practices. So they know that change has already come culturally. What hasn't caught up is our laws.\n\nCORNISH: Finally, what's your response to people who have talked about the idea of a backlash? Because often you hear the phrase that men who are publicly accused of sexual misconduct aren't getting, quote, unquote, \"due process.\" And I use that term because that's, like, a legal term (laughter) that people are using in a cultural conversation.\n\nGRAVES: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCORNISH: Do you think that that is going on? Do you think it's affecting the ability of people to come forward?\n\nGRAVES: One of the things that's interesting about this moment is the cultural change that is happening, it can seem unsettling, right? For many, many years, conduct that was totally inappropriate, conduct that was actually illegal already, went unchecked. And that shift is going to be uncomfortable for everyone, for the institutions, for all of the individuals involved.\n\nCORNISH: Fatima Goss Graves is president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center. Thank you for coming in.\n\nGRAVES: So glad to be here.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Stored on board are close-up pictures of the celestial body that's less than 20 miles wide, and four billion miles from the sun. The first images, just a few pixels across, arrived Tuesday morning and revealed a floating mass shaped like dog-bone, a peanut or a bowling pin, depending on your interpretation.\n\n\"Even though it's a pixelated blob still, it's a better pixelated blob,\" said project scientist Hal Weaver at a press conference. Sending photos from the edges of the solar system requires patience; while the first high-resolution photographs of Ultima Thule will be revealed later this week, the highest-resolution images won't be available until February. It will take many more months for all of the scientific data gathered by the probe to reach researchers back on earth.\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft was launched in 2006, charged with exploring the region beyond the planets closest to earth. As NPR's Nell Greenfield-Boyce reports, the probe has already proven invaluable to scientists.\n\nIn 2015, it reached Pluto, and what had long been just a fuzzy circle in photographs was revealed to be a stunning, dark-reddish world made of frozen nitrogen and methane, with ice mountains. ... After speeding past Pluto, this mission always planned to visit another icy world, given that it was flying through a region of the solar system called the Kuiper belt that's littered with thousands of small, icy bodies. But it was tricky to find a minor planet that was reachable with the spacecraft's remaining fuel.\n\nScientists used the Hubble Space telescope to find their candidate \u2014 Ultima Thule. NASA describes it as \"the farthest, most primitive object that humanity has ever seen up close.\"\n\nWhen this mission wraps-up, the New Horizons probe will still have, well, new horizons. It will start by continuing to explore the Kuiper belt, but could be directed to do another fly-by of a distant object, according to NASA. The team says it has enough power and fuel for 15-20 more years of work, and new software could be uploaded to the spacecraft to enable new missions. For now, the project's main limitation is a more terrestrial one: funding.\n\nWhile the New Horizons mission has set its own record, it's not the furthest a probe has been sent into space. In November, Voyager 2 joined is its sister ship Voyager 1 in interstellar space, more than four decades after being launched from Earth. During the course of their 11-billion mile trip, they snapped stunning photos of Uranus, Neptune and Saturn."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510328/eat-your-way-to-a-healthier-life", "text": "There are so many food tribes out there \u2014 everything from Keto to vegan.

She was 28, broke, full of frustrated literary ambition and convinced life was passing her by. She was wrong. Later that year, Gran sold her first novel, Saturn's Return to New York, newly reissued by Soho Press. Looking back, she writes in her introduction, \"this feeling of dread and doom at twenty-something seems dramatic and slightly ridiculous. At the time it all felt very important and very real.\" By astrological standards, it was.\n\nGran wrote Saturn's Return to New York during her own Saturn Return, which, for the non-astrologically inclined, is like a cosmic bat mitzvah, except that it happens 15 years later and you become an adult not by learning Torah, but by working through life's great challenges. But chances are, you knew that already. Nearly 20 years after Gran finished Saturn's Return to New York, astrology, like Saturn, has returned.\n\nLast January, the New York Times critic Amanda Hess wrote an article called \"How Astrology Took Over the Internet,\" describing \"astrology's return as a compelling content business as much as a traditional spiritual practice.\" She points to online astrologers' wide and lucrative followings, noting that \"Seemingly every cool-girl online brand ... features its own astrology column.\" Girl, here, is key. The astrology renaissance comes from, or is marketed to, women around Saturn Return age.\n\nMaybe all this had no bearing on Soho Press's decision to re-release Saturn's Return to New York. But whether the choice was canny or lucky, it was good. Gran's debut novel is perfectly suited to the present. It's eminently relatable, but without the glaring contemporariness that marks so many efforts to relate. I couldn't stand last year's The Girl Who Never Read Noam Chomsky, whose protagonist Elle described as \"an everywoman built for the twenty-first century,\" but I loved Saturn's Return to New York, with its protagonist built for no particular moment at all.\n\nLike an astrologer, Gran works in loose but specific strokes. Mary, her narrator, has a voice so wry and powerful it echoes in your ears. Gran is expert at social comedy, and at making rooms come alive. When she writes parties, you can smell the spilled drinks; when she writes Mary's terrible co-workers, you want to hide in the supply closet. She evokes friendship rapidly and well, especially when writing Mary's friend Chloe, who introduces her to the concept of Saturn Return. For Mary's 29th birthday, Chloe surprises her with an astrological consultation. \"I coo my happiness through lunch and up the short walk to this astrologer's apartment,\" Gran writes. \"It's cold out, and Chloe wraps her arm around mine like women do in movies.\" The combined tenderness and performance are spot-on.\n\nThe astrologer, though, warns Mary it's time to stop performing. Time to face her own emotions, particularly where her father is concerned. This is not Mary's way. She opens the novel by reporting, \"When I was seven, my father killed himself. He woke up one morning in 1977 and swallowed a bottle of Valium that my mother's doctor, ironically, had prescribed to help her cope with my father's depression. Well, the Valium helped with the stress, all right.\"\n\nThe Hallmark risk is high, but Mary's sharp wit and Gran's quick prose keep the novel from veering into sentimentality.\n\nSaturn's not having it. Mary needs to face her grief, and fast. Her distant, glamorous mother Evelyn is developing dementia. By novel's midpoint, she needs Mary's full-time care. You see where this is going: As Mary's mother weakens, the two women mourn together, become closer, et cetera. The Hallmark risk is high, but Mary's sharp wit and Gran's quick prose keep the novel from veering into sentimentality, and her astrological fixation broadens the story from an intimate family drama to a greater coming of age.\n\nThis is not to say you have to believe in astrology to enjoy Saturn's Return to New York. But Mary's astrological consults ground the novel outside her family. Gran uses the Saturn Return conceit to keep Mary focused on the question of, as Sheila Heti would put it, how a person should be. Her questions are the same she might have asked in 1969, or might ask in 2019: Would I rather be interesting or happy? How do I remain friends with somebody who's entered a life stage I haven't reached? Do I care about falling in love?\n\nIn the reissued version of Saturn's Return to New York, the answer to that last question is no. There was a love arc in the original, but Gran writes in her introduction that \u2014 spoiler warning ahead \u2014 she disliked it, felt it destabilized the novel's balance, and got rid of it this time around. The change is crucial. Before, Mary emerged from her Saturn Return orphaned, but newly coupled. Now, she emerges exhausted and alone. There's no narrative of coolness or happiness here, no triumphant gloss on the ending. There's a year of hard emotional work, and the reward is that Mary gets to enjoy her own company a bit more.\n\nThis means the novel's not a good pitch for astrology as life fix. Mary's Saturn Return changes her slightly, if at all. It's not what Internet-beloved astrologer Chani Nicholas would call \"Something that will help you come into a deeper appreciation of all you are capable of.\" Instead it's a bad year, rendered with bravery and prickly grace. Gran offers messy, halting, stutter-step emotional development \u2014 a process to which anyone, astrology lover or no, can relate.\n\nLily Meyer is a writer and translator living in Washington, D.C."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/20/695962061/stories-converge-in-a-flooded-bangkok", "text": "Stories Converge In A Flooded 'Bangkok'\n\nPitchaya Sudbanthad's novel, Bangkok Wakes to Rain, opens with a woman of indeterminate age (\"She is a child or a few thousand years old. Would it ever matter?\") approaching \"the building she thinks of as home.\" She enters the building's lobby, contemplates taking the elevator upstairs to see her parents, but she's suddenly hit with an unsettling feeling, and leaves. \"Some uproar above compels her to look up,\" Sudbanthad writes, and \"her instincts command her to cross her arms overhead, turn away, and brace.\"\n\nThe chapter ends there, suddenly and ominously. It's a fitting beginning for a novel suffused with the possibility of menace \u2014 the characters in Bangkok Wakes to Rain endure heartbreak, disease, climate disaster and violence, much of which takes place in or around the building in the first chapter, a condominium tower that used to be a house. It's a complex novel-in-stories, and a very good debut book from a promising new voice in fiction.\n\nBangkok Wakes to Rain straddles the line between novel and short story collection \u2014 it's broken into 23 chapters, some brief vignettes, some more substantive. The stories are linked, although this doesn't become apparent until late in the book.\n\nOne storyline follows Phineas Stevens, a 19th-century American missionary and doctor assigned to work in Bangkok. He's initially uneasy in Thailand, hoping to be transferred away; he harbors suspicions of the Thai people who he's meant to treat, writing in a letter, \"They are a proud, even arrogant people, having yet to come under the domain of a more advanced nation. They seem to regard our own purpose as merely to serve and sustain them in their lifelong pursuit of frivolity.\"\n\nRelated NPR Stories\n\nAnother thread tells the story of Clyde, an American expat jazz pianist who lives in the Thai capital, playing gigs to audiences comprised of Thai natives and U.S. service members stationed in the city during the Vietnam War. Clyde has been estranged from his longtime partner and lover, whom he misses dearly: \"Not a word had passed between them since he left the States. The most deafening thing he's ever heard is the silence between two people.\" He gets an unusual request from a Thai woman, who asks him to perform for several spirits that she's convinced are living in a wooden pillar in her house.\n\nThe main storyline of the book concerns two sisters, Nee and Nok, who have \"veered farther in their own directions across land and sea,\" Nok lives in Japan where she runs a Thai restaurant with her husband, Nee, a nurse by training, works in a condominium building as a receptionist. The two are long estranged; Nee has never forgiven her sister for doing business with an exiled Thai military officer who was part of a brutal dictatorship in the 1970s.\n\nNee's anger at her sister is inflamed by her memories of Siripohng, her lover, who was killed while protesting his country's tyrannical government. The chapter detailing his murder is the novel's most successful section \u2014 it plays to Sudbanthad's narrative strengths, managing to be affecting but not sentimental.\n\nSudbanthad proves to be a generous author with a keen eye for unique characters, who expertly evokes a sense of place.\n\nNot every chapter works quite as well. Sudbanthad is an elegant writer, but at times, his language gets the better of him \u2014 while his writing is mostly well balanced, it occasionally tips into the florid. But when he's restrained, he's capable of writing some unforgettable passages, like this one, reflecting on the massacre of student protesters in the 1970s: \"Those October dates swallowed everyone who'd been there into history's giant unlit belly, and that history into silence. The forgotten return again and again, as new names and faces, and again this city makes new ghosts.\"\n\nThe novel's structure is a tricky one, but Sudbanthad pulls it off pretty well \u2014 he wisely lets the reader make the connections between the stories, which makes for a rewarding read. He does try to do a little too much in the novel, which isn't uncommon for a young writer with a surfeit of good ideas; the book is overly long and could have used a bit more editing. Still, that's a minor complaint \u2014 even when the novel lags, the writing makes up for it.\n\nIt's not a perfect novel, but debut books almost never are. And Sudbanthad proves to be a generous author with a keen eye for unique characters, who expertly evokes a sense of place \u2014 his descriptions of Thailand are gorgeous; the reader feels transported there.

During one conversation with Maddow, New Yorker writer Malcolm recounts, she learned the host \"marks up the text that she will read from a teleprompter with cues for gestures, pauses, smiles, laughs, frowns \u2014 all the body language that goes into her performance of the Rachel figure.\" Malcolm asked if she could see one of Maddow's marked-up scripts. \"She consented, but then thought better of it.\"\n\nIt's a perfect Malcolm moment, simultaneously illustrating the tension in the journalist-subject relationship and provoking that subject into an act of helpless self-exposure. We couldn't possibly have learned more about the famously straight-talking Maddow from her scripts than we do from her decision to withhold them. Malcolm realizes this, and so an incident most reporters would count as a loss becomes the pivot point of the story.\n\nThat's only to be expected, though. A remorseless philosopher of journalism, Malcolm knows her job is, at bottom, to slash her subjects' protective carapaces down to the bone. And in an age beset by flashy, clumsy scimitars, her weapon of choice remains the stiletto. For decades, her self-deprecating manner has lured egocentric subjects within reach of her steel \u2014 at which point, usually, they've skewered themselves.\n\nOr they used to, anyway. Today Malcolm's targets see her coming, and their parries aren't always as self-lacerating as Maddow's. That may be why the deliciously, operatically deluded characters populating Malcolm's previous work are missing here. Take \"A Very Sadistic Man,\" in which Malcolm (who wrote about Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes in 1994's The Silent Woman) reviews Jonathan Bate's biography of Hughes. Alas, Ted's sister Olwyn Hughes \u2014 the controlling harpy who was so fun to hate in The Silent Woman \u2014 is present only as a memory. Bate's jejune screw-ups are no compensation.\n\nEven Sarah Palin, whose reality show Malcolm reviews, doesn't get a really satisfying comeuppance. Palin's foibles, like those of fellow subjects Norman Podhoretz and Jane Gallop, are simply too well-established; there's nothing left for Malcolm to do. The closest we come to a classically Malcolmian figure is designer Eileen Fisher, in the titular essay. And her only sin is banishing one of her cats to live outside in the cold.\n\nIn fact, the cat story looms large over the rest of the collection, and not because \u2014 as testy Fisher fans claimed in one online forum \u2014 it's petty or extraneous. It's a vivid little drama that's as psychologically revelatory as Malcolm's notorious accounts of Ingrid Sischy chopping tomatoes and Joe McGinniss making crabmeat pie. Fisher, having ousted the cat for fighting and peeing everywhere (eliminating it from her home as ruthlessly as she pares away extraneous trimmings from her clothes), then twists herself into a pretzel trying to justify her decision. But that's not all she does: She also notices Malcolm noticing. The next time Malcolm meets with Fisher and her two handlers, they've realized Malcolm might write about the cat, and all four women are embarrassed. \"We all laughed, perhaps a little too loudly and heartily,\" Malcolm recalls. Suddenly, she's sharing the spotlight with her subjects.\n\nThe Fisher story reveals just how far Malcolm has evolved from the unassuming reporter who might once have reassured herself before an important interview, \"Nobody's looking at you.\" Now, the people she profiles are on their guard (and bring along handlers). Maybe that's why she's written more literary criticism in recent years. Her analyses of Anna Karenina, the Bloomsbury group and Joseph Mitchell are as elegant and acute as her journalism. But when she turns her attention to a controversy over Tolstoy translations, you realize how much you've been missing her stiletto. Simply by comparing rival versions of different passages, she allows a couple of newbie translators whom \"the critical establishment [has] embraced\" to damn themselves.\n\nHankering for these sorts of takedowns may be petty \u2014 even, perhaps, the kind of moral failing that marks so many of Malcolm's characters out for judgment. So let it be said: Nobody's Looking At You is brimful of all the eloquence, erudition and insight a thoughtful reader could want.

Trams are powered by djinn-made intelligence and overseen by extremely mundane bureaucracy, and automata called \"boilerplate eunuchs\" with varying degrees of sentience work for and alongside humans. Even more remarkably, women are on the cusp of gaining the right to vote.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, agents Hamed Nasr and Onsi Youssef represent the Ministry of Alchemy, Enchantments, and Supernatural Entities, investigating untoward magical occurrences and abuses. When the Superintendent of Tram Safety and Maintenance calls them in to deal with the titular haunted tram car, they're both bemused \u2013 but taking the case leads them on a merry chase through their city and alternate approaches to magic and philosophy.\n\nHow to explain how much I loved this? Usually fantasies in Arabic-speaking settings are a hard sell for me, as even the competently done ones throw me out of the story with well-intentioned attempts to evoke atmosphere. All it takes is someone writing \"The El-Something\" \u2013 which translates to \"The the-something\" \u2014 and the record of my reading brain skips and stutters, and I'm suddenly very firmly on the outside of something trying to invite me in. It's not unlike a friend asking me into their home and, in a gesture of hospitality, covering everything in carpets and camels and sand while playing the opening song from Disney's Aladdin in order to put me at ease.\n\nThis novella is perfect and I loved it and you should read it.\n\nBut this book! This book made me feel at home even though I've never been to Egypt. The cadences of the speech were there, Arabic words where they should be in a sentence to denote emphasis without straying into empty exotic flourish (\"misguided men who label what we do some baladi custom or even haram,\" says Sheikha Nadiyaa, and I shouted with joy). Hamed and Onsi are pure delight \u2014 Hamed's slightly sulky point of view ripe for puncturing with new information, which eager, earnest and well-read Onsi readily supplies. This is less a story about a haunted tram car than a vivid, loving imagining of what a successfully decolonized Middle-East and North Africa could look like, with people looking at each other and seeing each other and their differences without the interfering, distorting lenses of whiteness and imperialism.\n\nAnd the women! For all that the main characters are men, the gaze that encounters several different, vivacious female characters is an awed and loving one, and conversations about gender feel grounded in character and richly effective. The work women are doing together to obtain suffrage is deeply felt and wonderful, and I was frequently overwhelmed by how much joy the reading was bringing me.\n\nThe Haunting of Tram Car 015 is a zippy, wonderful romp, and it's made me want to seek out everything P. Dj\u00e8l\u00ed Clark has written in this setting (there's a novelette on Tor.com as well, \"A Dead Djinn in Cairo,\" from 2016).

How?\n\nThe premise of Sharma Shields' second novel, The Cassandra, is excellent. A young woman named Mildred Groves, tormented by strange premonitions and a manipulative mother, takes a secretarial position at the secretive Hanford research center at the height of World War II. Mildred is delighted to be at Hanford, but her premonitions get worse every day: dying children, faceless burn victims, all the suffering Hanford's mysterious \"product\" \u2014 which turns out to be plutonium for the atom bomb \u2014 will inflict. This should be a perfect setup for moral torment, political interrogation, and the philosophical rigor of the Greek myth from which the novel takes its name. Unfortunately, Shields strays far too frequently into neatness and cuteness, and so The Cassandra leaves no questions in its wake.\n\nThe novel's first and greatest problem is Mildred herself. She's faced her share of challenges, both as a clairvoyant and a woman in a world hostile to female intelligence, but all those challenges have taught her is to try \u2014 not too hard, though \u2014 to keep her mouth shut. Mildred is overly trusting, overly enthusiastic, prone to internal declarations like, \"I had gone from caretaker of Mother to caretaker of the world.\" In high school, her classmates called her Mad Mildred; at Hanford, the men she works with call her Decent Milly. She's a bit of both, but as a narrator, she's Decent Milly all the way. Her innocence grates even before The Cassandra's ethical quandaries begin to emerge. Once they become clear, it's maddening.\n\nThis is particularly true because Mildred never succeeds at suppressing her doubts. She works for Dr. Hall, a physicist reporting directly to Enrico Fermi, and she frequently relays her visions to her boss. The first time, when she warns Dr. Hall his product will lead to mass death, he tells her not to flatter herself that dreams have meaning. Mildred claims to know as much, but \"the very next moment, despite myself or because of it,\" warns him one more time, \"But it will come true.\" From here on, Mildred voices truth to power once a chapter. She knows Dr. Hall dismisses her predictions as the poetic ramblings of an untrained mind, but she doesn't seem to care. For Mildred, it's enough to deliver her warnings. She never reflects on what her conversations with Dr. Hall mean, or what they lack.\n\nWhat they lack, of course, is listening. Nobody listens to a Cassandra. This should be an ethical crisis for Mildred: How can she try harder? How can she get her message across? But rather than investing in these questions, Shields focuses on Mildred's attempts to blend in with the other women at Hanford. Only once does Mildred ask herself, \"How much would we improve as a human race if we listened to the warnings given to us?\" Shields may expect the reader to consider the question, but Mildred never does.\n\nThe Cassandra is best when Mildred moves away from her peers, and from Hanford itself. Her visions take place at night, while she sleepwalks through the Columbia River gorge, and in those scenes, the novel takes flight. Shields writes the natural world with clear joy, and she evokes scenes of destruction with horrifying beauty. Crucially, this happens when Mildred is not in control of herself, let alone her story. During the visions, Shields is in charge, not constrained by her protagonist's determined innocence and cheer.\n\nFor Mildred, it's enough to deliver her warnings. She never reflects on what her conversations ... mean, or what they lack.\n\nWhen Mildred is lucid, on the other hand, she seems to stifle Shields' prose. The scenes in Hanford's dining halls and offices move fluidly, but lack the energy of Mildred's visions. Instead, Shields invests in Mildred's efforts to stay in her friend Beth's good graces, which the reader knows early on won't be possible. The only person who truly likes Mildred is Tom Cat, a sweet, crooked-toothed man who wants to marry her. Unfortunately, he's friends with an obvious predator named Gordon, who wants to marry Beth, torment Mildred, and assert his macho dominance over Hanford as a whole. His storyline coalesces into a neat demonstration of The Cassandra's warnings against unchecked power. Refreshingly, the Tom Cat plot is less neat. Mildred can't stand his desire, though she's no stranger to desire itself. Her failed efforts to accept his love become the novel's murkiest element, and, as a result, its best.\n\nIt's possible that Shields never wanted murk. Certainly her political goals are clear: The Cassandra is a protest against the atomic bomb, against our desire for knowledge and advancement at the expense of human lives, and against the sexism and classism on which the real-life Hanford ran. By those measures, it succeeds, but not nearly as well as a journalistic or historical investigation of Hanford could have. And as a novel, The Cassandra leaves much to be desired. Because Mildred never truly reckons with the philosophical and emotional problems that her premonitions create, the reader never has to. Because she never truly fights to be heard, the reader never has to listen. By the end of The Cassandra, Mildred is literally and figuratively mute, and we have no reason to be sorry.\n\nLily Meyer is a writer and translator living in Washington, D.C."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/17/694892002/in-the-city-in-the-middle-of-the-night-big-ideas-lead-to-big-upheavals", "text": "In 'The City In The Middle Of The Night,' Big Ideas Lead To Big Upheavals\n\n\"'The founders of that city had a valid theory of human nature, but they took it too far.

A point at which the writer must lay out, in plain terms, their central argument. It doesn't matter where it happens, only that it does. It is the place where the main character(s) realize the stakes, understand the cost, see \u2014 even if only briefly \u2014 the future. No matter where it comes, it is the middle of the story: it's geographic center. Everything before it will be prologue. Everything after, the result.\n\nIn The City In The Middle Of The Night, Charlie Jane Anders places her argument on page 212, halfway down the page, in the middle of a moment of tumult, in the process of meeting a new character. \"Grand social ideas ... break if you put too much weight on them.\"\n\nThat's the book. All of it. Twelve words.\n\nHere's where we're at: The planet January, a tidally-locked body far from earth. One side faces the sun and is a hell that'll melt you with its heat. The other faces deep space. It'll freeze you with its darkness. Humans came here long ago, after some fairly loosely understood ecological catastrophe, and chose (rather inexplicably) this openly hostile world to settle \u2014 a place where they could only exist in the narrow margins between daylight and darkness.\n\nThey built two great cities, Xiosphant and Argelo. In the first, life is ordered, regimented, lived by the tick and tock of an artificial time system to compensate for the lack of a traditional day/night cycle. The language, the economy, the politics \u2014 everything has been molded by an order to assimilate and thrive in this alien place, warped by the lack of a natural system, frayed by the slow breaking-down of all the technology that came with them from Earth. The second, Argelo, is the opposite. It is anarchic, libertine, run by constantly warring criminal gangs. There, you can do whatever you want. Problem is, so can everyone else.\n\nAnd yes, I get it. This all sounds YA-simple, doesn't it? The people may as well all be wearing special colors or badges to denote their specific caste, just so we know who to root for when the plucky female heroine convinces them to rise up in rebellion.\n\nOh, wait. They do.\n\nBut stick with me a minute because there's more here. Lots (and lots) more.\n\nIn the beginning there is Sophie who loves Bianca and Bianca who also loves Bianca. Sophie, a poor kid from the dark side of Xiosphant, who brute-forced her way into the fancy-pants university that Bianca (rich girl, privileged, gorgeous, horrible in a way that will haunt you by the end) was pretty much born to.\n\nBianca likes playing revolutionary. Likes shouting about justice and rebellion between glittering parties and balls. Sophie, naturally, plays along, But one day, Bianca essentially steals three dollars from a cash register to buy drinks for her fellow trust-fund Che Guevaras. The cops get involved. Sophie takes the rap for her \u2014 not wanting to see her friend's beautiful life spoiled. And so the police kill her. Or try to. They perform what amounts to an extra-judicial banishment, tossing Sophie outside the city walls to die amid the cold and the crocodiles.\n\nDid I not mention the crocodiles? Oh, you're gonna love this.\n\nBefore the humans came, January already had a native species. The crocodiles (who Sophie later names the Gelet) are intelligent, cultured, advanced. They communicate telepathically, by touch and scent, share all memories of everything ever, and have an enormous city in the middle of the planet's dark side. The humans, of course, hate them because they look like giant furry ice lobsters. So they hunt them, kill them, sometimes eat them. Because people, right? We're just the worst.\n\n[City] is a story about how grand social ideas break, and who gets hurt worst in the breaking.\n\nExcept, okay, yeah. We kinda are. And that's where Anders goes here, because The City is basically a story about exactly that worst-ness. All of it. It is almost a fable with its talking animals. Basically a no-holds-barred poli-sci debate held between earnest sophomores, but dressed up in the drag of a scifi novel. It is a story about how grand social ideas break, and who gets hurt worst in the breaking. A story of memory, family, lineage, class and revolution (and giant ice lobsters) where the vast majority of the action is emotional, relational.\n\nAnd yes, there is adventure and action. I mean, this is a book with spaceships, pirates, smugglers, rebels, rich girls and alien lobster monsters. And Charlie Jane knows how to tell those stories, for sure.\n\nBut it is more than that, is what I'm saying. It is an intimate portrait of people as much as it is a piece of culturally aware social scifi \u2014 a look at our moment in history through a distorting lens of aliens and spaceships. And it is those people who break everything that lies broken by the end of things; who are the living, breathing foci of the \"valid theor[ies] of human nature\" being discussed, and the eyes through which we will see the beginnings, the fiery middles and the cold, dark ends of things before we are through.\n\nJason Sheehan knows stuff about food, video games, books and Starblazers.

They were ones that we took only after great consideration and review,\" McCabe says. \"This was the recommendation of the investigators who were already looking into the Russia case, the idea that Russia may have meddled in our election.\"\n\nBefore authorizing the investigation, McCabe shared his reasoning with the \"Gang of Eight,\" a bipartisan group of senators and Congressional representatives who oversees intelligence issues.\n\n\"In that process, no one objected [to the investigation],\" he says. \"The leadership on the Hill did not disagree.\"\n\nThe president may have taken exception to the investigation, however; in March 2018, McCabe was fired from the FBI, just 26 hours before his scheduled retirement.\n\nTrump responded to McCabe's ouster by tweeting: \"Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy.\"\n\nMcCabe points to that tweet as further evidence that Trump is undermining the efforts of the nation's top law enforcement agency.\n\n\"It is just taking us one step closer to the world of bullying and fear that this president prefers to function in,\" McCabe says. \"It makes the job harder for the men and women of the FBI to protect America.\"\n\nMcCabe's new book is The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump.\n\nInterview highlights\n\nOn President Trump and Fox News host Sean Hannity characterizing McCabe's conversation with Rosenstein about the 25th Amendment as a \"coup\"\n\nThe fact that the president uses a word, or that right-wing media uses a word, or that Sean Hannity uses the same word, simply does not make it true. I mean, we know that many of the words that all three of those folks use are frequently false and, in my own experience, proven to be slanderous and incredibly hurtful. But nevertheless, I will answer it directly: To characterize those comments by Rod Rosenstein as a \"coup\" is just utterly ridiculous.\n\nOn Sen. Lindsey Graham's vow to hold a hearing with McCabe about the 25th Amendment conversation\n\nI invite the committee, or any other committee on the Hill ... to ask themselves why is it two of the highest ranking officials in the Department of Justice and the FBI in May of 2017 had to even consider the fact that the president of the United States might pose a national security risk to this country.\n\nI will cooperate with the committee in whatever way I can. ... I will take every step I possibly can to sit down with the committee and tell them what I know. But I will say this: If all they are interested in is Rod Rosenstein's mention of the 25th Amendment or Rod Rosenstein's offer to wear a wire \u2014 if that's all they're interested in \u2014 it will be a very short and uneventful hearing.\n\nI invite the committee, or any other committee on the Hill, to look beyond that, to ask themselves why is it two of the highest ranking officials in the Department of Justice and the FBI in May of 2017 had to even consider the fact that the president of the United States might pose a national security risk to this country. I think that would be a much broader hearing and a much more interesting and important one.\n\nOn what made the FBI believe that the president might pose a threat to national security\n\nThere were a number of things that we considered over the weeks leading up to [FBI Director] Jim [Comey]'s firing. And then, of course, the firing itself, really, I think, changed the way that we added up all those elements of kind of circumstantial evidence.\n\nThe president was clearly dissatisfied with or angry about the existence of the Russia investigation. He had publicly attacked it. I know this seems quaint now, because it's been going on for years, but at the time to see the president publicly attacking and undermining the investigation was concerning to us, because, again, it raised the question: Why would he engage in this? Why would he say these things?\n\nThe fact that he came to Jim Comey and asked Jim Comey to get rid of the investigation into Michael Flynn was greatly concerning to us. The fact that he insisted that the director publicly announce that he was not under investigation was also somewhat concerning to us then. So that's kind of where we were before Jim Comey was fired.\n\nThen, of course, he fires the director of the FBI, makes a series of of odd statements about his decision to do so, culminating with the public announcement to Lester Holt in that now infamous NBC interview where he said, \"Yes, I was thinking about Russia when I fired the director.\" And then, of course, he follows that with the comments to the Russians themselves about having fired the director, and how that had released a lot of the pressure that was on him. All of those circumstances put us in a position where we couldn't any longer deny the fact that we were in possession of articulable facts that might indicate a national security threat could exist.\n\nOn an instance where Trump didn't listen to what his intelligence officers were telling him\n\nHe was very focused on North Korea and the fact that the North Koreans had recently test-launched several missiles, which is a topic that was concerning everyone at the time. He shared with the group that he did not believe that the North Koreans had actually launched any missiles. He did not believe that they had the capacity to launch missiles. And he explained that he didn't believe that because he had been told that by the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin. ...\n\nThat's a very troubling thing to hear, as a senior intelligence officer and as one of the people responsible for getting information to the president and his staff for the purpose of making the decisions that they need to make. So when you are doing that in an environment where the president has made it pretty clear that he doesn't trust the intelligence agencies, he doesn't trust the process, that is a very hard problem to fix.\n\nOn interviewing with Trump for the FBI director position following Comey's firing\n\nThe president began our interaction by launching into about a five minute monologue on the Electoral College results in North Carolina from the 2016 campaign, which, quite frankly, was a topic I could not speak to. I didn't really know anything about that. So I kind of sat there and just listened to what he had to say.\n\nHe then kind of spun off in a few different directions. He talked a lot about how great it was that I was there interviewing for the job. ... I thought that the chances were probably not good at that point that I'd be getting the job, but you know I was still honored to be asked. And that's an interview that I don't think any FBI agent would ever turn down. ...\n\nHe's an overwhelming communicator. He talks quickly. He jumps from topic to topic and then sometimes gets kind of stalled on one particular thought that he'll repeat several times. He kind of sits behind the desk but leans forward with his hands out towards you, gestures a lot with his hands. It's hard really to get a word in under any circumstances. I thought a job interview might be more of an exchange, but it turned out not to be.\n\nOn being fired from the FBI\n\nThe Threat How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump by Andrew G.

How?\n\nThe president has a pretty well-known and well-established habit of attacking people who say things that he doesn't like, and he attempts to destroy first someone's credibility so that others won't listen to what they say, or believe what they say. So the fact that that's exactly what he has done to me here really shouldn't have been a surprise. I think I probably should have seen this coming.\n\nOn working in the '90s in the FBI Organized Crime Task Force and following Russian organized crime in New York\n\nPart of the work we did on the squad was to really try to watch and understand and hamper the efforts of major organized crime figures overseas, Russian organized crime figures overseas, who were at that time attempting to establish a foothold in the United States for their criminal activity, or for their purportedly legitimate business activity. And that's something that concerned us greatly. Do I recognize some of the names we are currently talking about now?

She runs a staff at her family's store, and she's assertive, and she has great ideas \u2014 and then she gets back into her family situation and she goes to pieces, because she is slightly awestruck by her older siblings ... they've become kind of stuck in family roles. And it's interesting, but I was inspired by people that I've spoken to, and especially, I have to say, around Christmastime, when people go back to their families, and you find that they start talking in their old roles. Like they might be a really successful person but they go home and they're the little brother, or they're still resentful over that bedroom that should have been there ... I think family dynamics are choppy waters to navigate, and I wanted to give her the choppiest of waters because I always slightly torture my heroines.\n\nOn writing about 20-somethings\n\nI just think there's something exciting about the time of life when you're on the lookout for opportunities in all directions ... everything is ahead of you.

And then I love the idea of two strangers meeting. I just, there's something magical about the feeling that you're in a big city, and you go to a coffee shop, and there's a guy opposite you, and in one version you just walk away and never see him again, but in this version you become connected.\n\nKarina Pauletti and Martha Ann Overland edited this piece for radio, and Petra Mayer adapted it for the Web."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/16/695344751/former-teacher-blames-education-policymakers-for-atlanta-cheating-scandal", "text": "Former Teacher Blames Education Policymakers For Atlanta Cheating Scandal\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Bazemore/AP John Bazemore/AP\n\nIn 2015, a verdict was delivered on the cheating scandal in Atlanta Public Schools.\n\nA 2011 Georgia state report found unethical behavior in the school system, including teachers and principals changing wrong answers on standardized tests. Two years later, a grand jury indicted the Atlanta school superintendent and 34 other educators.

How?\n\nI wrote this book for my son. It started off as a journal and I wanted him to know the truth about what actually happened to me when he got older. And I also wrote this book to set the record straight, and to ask the question: Who should really be held accountable for cheating the children? Our children have been cheated by those who have willfully torn apart black communities through displacement and gentrification, underfunded and privatized public schools, and then have criminalized black educators for a dysfunctional system that was designed to fail. ... I feel like this case is extremely important because public education is under attack, as we've seen in places where teachers are striking, and the cheating scandal was used to portray public education as a failure and justify privatizing schools. And so many people are resisting that right now. And so we believe that, you know, winning the freedom of Atlanta teachers will be a win for educators everywhere.\n\nOn why this scandal may have emerged in the first place\n\nRobinson: Well, that's a good question, because when you think about cheating on standardized tests, this is something that was happening over the entire country. Over 40 states have had cheating allegations \u2014 14 of those states, it's been known to be widespread cheating. In Washington, D.C. there were 103 schools that were flagged for high levels of suspiciously high test scores. And so to think that what happened in Atlanta was, you know, like an anomaly \u2014 you know, that was the biggest thing: Why were the educators in Atlanta charged with racketeering when this was happening over the entire country? And in the book we outline Atlanta's history of displacement and the destruction of black communities. And I think the criminalization of black educators was the next legacy in that history.\n\nMartin: But why? I mean, what's your argument for why this happened in this place at this time? I mean, Atlanta has an African-American mayor, the DA is African-American, the two prosecutors are African-American \u2014 I mean, what would be their motive?\n\nRobinson: You know, I don't have the answer to that, you know. I don't.\n\nMartin: But you seem to think race played a role.\n\nRobinson: I absolutely think race played a role. ... There were some white educators who were implicated in that GBI [Georgia Bureau of Investigation] report, and none of them were indicted. And I can't help to think that if it was 35 white educators, that it would have gotten to this point where they were charged with racketeering.\n\nOn why some of the accused educators entered guilty pleas\n\nYou know, there were some people who testified during the trial that they only took a plea deal because they were stressed out from the entire ordeal. And some people, you know, they actually blamed it on No Child Left Behind, that they don't want their schools to close \u2014 because under the No Child Left Behind Act, after a certain number of years, they could close your school, they could turn it into a charter school or could be taken over by the state. And so I was facing 25 years in prison; there were some people who were facing 40 years in prison. And so we had that option, of facing decades in prison, or doing community service saying that we're guilty, you know, and maybe paying a fine. And so that was a tough decision to make: Having to spend decades in prison or just say that you're guilty.\n\nOn if anybody is guilty here, in light of public test score analysis\n\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. The education officials and policymakers that have pushed high-stakes testing \u2014 that is who has cheated these children. That is who is guilty. Which is why you have all of these states that have had high levels of erasures, and no one has done anything about it.\n\nLiz Baker, Gemma Watters and Denise Couture produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

Debs' Resurrects A Stubborn Question: Why Is Labor History So Boring?\n\nWhy is labor history so boring? Left-leaning intellectuals have worried at this question for decades. Back in 1983, Irving Howe suggested that the field's notorious leadenness stems from a deep-seated attraction to ideas over people. \"The Marxist mind finds itself drawn, with an almost punitive willfulness, to such abstractions as 'social forces,' 'political positions,' and 'relations of production,'\" he wrote in a New York Review of Books piece about turn-of-the-century labor leader Eugene V. Debs. \"Before these formidable categories, the actual figures of history tend to fade.\" Fortuitously, Howe added, a new wave of historians was striving to inject some life into the genre.\n\nThe struggle continues today. No one reading Eugene V. Debs: A Graphic Biography could doubt that authors Paul Buhle and Steve Max have accessibility in mind. Both are powerhouses of the left, so it's no wonder they're acutely aware of the movement's people problem. Max helped found Students for a Democratic Society and has worked with numerous organizations including the Democratic Socialists of America. Buhle literally wrote the book on the movement, with the Encyclopedia of the American Left. Over three decades he's also authored and edited dozens of volumes on left-wing politics, theory and people, several of them \u2014 like 2017's well-received Johnny Appleseed \u2014 graphic novels.\n\nUnfortunately, in this case the authors' decision to illustrate Debs' life seems driven less by an appreciation of the artistic possibilities as by a hope of attracting a spectrum of readers. Buhle and Max seem to see comic art as a way to dress up what they're really interested in \u2014 and what they're really interested in is exactly what Howe mocked back in 1983. Throughout this biography, men at podiums spout ideological manifestoes and brave, interchangeable workers shake their fists at police. The authors even intersperse the graphical parts of the book with chunks of written narrative, as if they simply can't trust the drawings to convey meaning on their own.\n\nIt's hard to know how much artist Noah Van Sciver had to do with this book's shortcomings. Would any artist, much less one as gifted and experienced as Sciver, repeatedly choose to illustrate the most boring parts of anecdotes while describing the interesting parts in words? Whether it was Sciver's decision or the authors', that's what this book does. \"The deaths and injuries caused by poor equipment and long hours made even skilled work on the railroads dangerous,\" notes one caption. But instead of some terrible accident, the panel merely depicts several men (one missing a leg) standing with their shovels. It may well have been copied straight from a period photograph. Elsewhere Sciver copies old newspaper cartoons, and once \u2014 as if to show how little they value their artist \u2014 Buhle and Max even include one of those cartoons, unaltered.\n\nUnfortunately, in this case the authors' decision to illustrate Debs' life seems driven less by an appreciation of the artistic possibilities as by a hope of attracting a spectrum of readers.\n\nIt's an unwise decision. That drawing (apparently by caricaturist William Allen Rogers) is elegant in a way Sciver's work is not, and it casts Sciver in a bad light. Sciver draws with a looseness that can seem sloppy, especially when he's stuck producing page after aforementioned page of men at podiums spouting ideological manifestoes. He does better with strikes and battles, but these scenes are too few and too cramped. Meanwhile, half a page is given to Debs sitting on the porch of a sanitarium, explaining that he's too sick to give speeches.\n\nDebs' poor health is a constant theme, unsurprisingly. A history of illness is a useful element in a hagiography \u2014 which this undoubtedly is. Its hero is miraculously free of inner conflicts and bad impulses. Buhle and Max seem to think you make someone heroic by scrubbing them clean of flaws and having them deliver stirring oratory, so poor Sciver had to copy out line upon line of speeches. There's even a hand-drawn chart comparing the 1932 Socialist platform with programs adopted by the Roosevelt administration.\n\nIt's hard to know what makes Marxists so much more interested in ideas than people \u2014 or, for that matter, in words over art. In this case, both proclivities are fatal. 35 years after Howe pondered the boredom problem, it remains as formidable as ever.\n\nEtelka Lehoczky has written about comics for The Atlantic and The Los Angeles Review of Books.

The comics industry is, was, and always will be ... a bit complicated.\n\nJust like Mir and Weldon's relationship.\n\nMiriam \"Mir\" Kendrick lives in Sandford, a small town in Nova Scotia. She works at a comic shop called Emporium of Wonders. She also happens to be the granddaughter of artist Micah Kendrick, who created the TomorrowMen comics along with writer Joseph Warrick.\n\nThe legal battle that ensued between Kendrick and Warrick is reminiscent of the famous relationship between Batman co-creators Bob Kane and Bill Finger- \u2014 Kane took all the credit for Batman, and Finger died penniless. (In 2015, DC Comics and Warner Bros. finally agreed to grant Finger a co-creator credit.)\n\nIn Hicks' version of the story, Micah died and his daughter settled out of court. The settlement allowed the Kendricks a comfortable, if frugal life. But Mir is not a fan of her simple dial-up-internet, non-cordless-phone, vegetable-garden-in-the-backyard existence. Darn those Warricks!\n\nEnter Weldon Warrick, troublemaking L.A. bad boy forced to lived with his aunt and uncle in Canada as a punishment. In the first chapter, Mir saves Weldon from a sound beating by some local thugs. Turns out, he deserved it \u2014 but that doesn't sway Mir from falling for the one boy on the planet she should Absolutely Not Date.\n\nI was a little surprised to find that the rest of Hicks's novel was not as action-packed as the opening scene. Instead, the book blossoms into a tale of two star-crossed teens who don't know how to get what they want, or if they're even sure about what they want in the first place.\n\nThe story never stops being interesting, but it didn't stop me from putting it down a few times to go do other things. The big court battle has already happened, years before \u2014 we're seeing the aftermath. Moments between Mir and Weldon happen slowly and quietly, without pomp and circumstance, much like small-town Sandford itself. Nothing toxic or earth-shattering or life-threatening unfolds; I wasn't up until 2am trying to binge the last chapter. And really, there's nothing wrong with that \u2014 the slower pace does not stop this book from being an excellent story.\n\n'Comics Will Break Your Heart' is a sweet book ... about how love and loneliness don't care how much money you have, and how actions have consequences.\n\nTeens will identify with Mir's internal struggle about going off to college. She's bright and has a million possibilities ahead of her, but not if she remains stuck in Sandford. Is she willing to leave her family and best friends to make that happen? And what is she doing with this boy she can't stop thinking about?\n\nWeldon, on the other hand, wants a functional family. He doesn't see the material things Mir lacks, he only sees that she has a mom and dad who live together, love each other, and want the best for her. He wants to be part of that so much that he lies to a lot of people to make it happen: his aunt and uncle, his father, and even Mir.\n\nUltimately, Comics Will Break Your Heart is a sweet book about two young people falling for each other. It's about how love and loneliness don't care how much money you have, and how actions have consequences. It will leave you with a smile and warm fuzzies in your chest. And, I promise, it will not break your heart.\n\nAlethea Kontis is a voice actress and award-winning author of over 20 books for children and teens."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/14/694259009/the-source-of-self-regard-speaks-to-todays-social-and-political-moment", "text": "'The Source Of Self-Regard' Speaks To Today's Social And Political Moment\n\nEven though the essays, speeches, and meditations in Toni Morrison's most recent nonfiction collection were written over the course of four decades, The Source of Self-Regard speaks to today's social and political moment as directly as this morning's headlines.\n\nMorrison turns her penetrating analysis on the mass movement of people across the globe, foreigners and foreignness, and what it means to be \"exiled in the place one belongs.\" She takes on racism \u2014 in the media, society, and American literature \u2014 and examines how, step by deliberate step, nations move towards \"its succubus twin fascism.\" Devotees should be happy to know that the Nobel laureate also delves into her own artistic process in addition to exploring the work of the painter Romare Bearden, theater director Peter Sellars, and writers ranging from Toni Cade Bambara to Chinua Achebe to Herman Melville. In short, you can expect virtually every entry in the collection, whether it was written in the 1970s or in this century, to feel strikingly relevant today.\n\nPerhaps intentionally, the book's structure helps underscore the timelessness of its pieces since the work is arranged by theme rather than chronology. The first of three parts is \"The Foreigner's Home,\" which concerns itself with the threats of globalization and our unhelpful compulsion to demonize and ostracize the \"other.\" It opens with a moving prayer to those who died on Sept. 11 and, in its haunting power, is reminiscent of Morrison's fiction.\n\nThe remaining sections also begin with recognitions of the dead, and a tender, self-reflexive tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. introduces the interlude, \"Black Matter(s).\" The primary focus on the interlude is the historical and current role of Africanism, a term Morrison uses to refer to white Americans' \"collective needs to allay internal fears and rationalize external exploitation... a fabricated brew of darkness, otherness, alarm, and desire.\"\n\nA poignant eulogy to novelist and playwright James Baldwin opens the final part of the book, \"God's Language.\" This section illuminates both Morrison's work and the art of others, addresses the inevitability of cross-genre inspiration, and examines the role of the artist in society. It should be noted, however, that the author's central themes are so connected that each spans the entirety of the collection.\n\nMemorials of a sort may begin each of the book's sections, but Morrison ultimately is less concerned with acknowledging the dead than with presenting a call to action for the living. These are not frivolous pieces and Morrison has no interest in addressing mundane topics. As she puts it in \"Hard, Lasting, and True,\" a 2005 lecture at the University of Miami, \"I believe it is silly, not to say irresponsible, to concern myself with lipstick... when there is a plague in the land.\" Throughout the collection, just as in her fiction, Morrison tackles headfirst the weighty issues that have long troubled America's conscience. (Of course, with reports of children sleeping in cages on our southern border, one can certainly argue that the nation's conscience hasn't been troubled nearly enough.)\n\nSome of the strongest entries in the collection challenge the seemingly eternal human compulsion to move towards separation rather than unity, to elevate superficial difference over shared humanity. Words from her 2009 convocation at Oberlin, \"Home,\" reverberate to the present day, as she observes that \"[p]orous borders are understood in some quarters to be areas of threat and certain chaos, and whether real or imagined, enforced separation is posited as the solution.\" Thanks to the breadth of the collection, it's easy to see how this concern has long preoccupied her. At a symposium in 1976, more than 30 years earlier, she argues that racism, sexism, and classicism are born of the same source \u2014 \"a deplorable inability to project, to become the 'other,' to imagine her or him.\"\n\nThis \"intellectual flaw,\" as Morrison characterizes it, is perhaps most evident in her 1990 lecture, \"Black Matter(s),\" included in the interlude of the same name. In all honesty, the entire section is profoundly insightful and includes provocative examinations of the black presence in American literature \u2014 and a fascinating consideration of Moby-Dick as an allegory for \"whiteness idealized.\" Yet it is the title lecture itself that is particularly compelling as it explores how \"the rights of man, an organizing principle upon which the nation was founded, was inevitably, and especially, yoked to Africanism.\"\n\nOf course, to highlight every notable observation or intriguing thesis would be to write an entire, if smaller, book itself. There are few pages that don't contain sentences that invite repeated reading, because of their stimulating content, and often because of Morrison's trademark lyricism. Is it a collection worth reading? Undoubtedly.\n\nIf there are complaints to be made, they are few. For my part, I would have loved the inclusion of \"Making America White Again,\" an essay that appeared in The New Yorker after the 2016 presidential election. I could also imagine that, for some, recurring refrains could have been culled from the collection. (Others, like me, will be less concerned about repetition and will simply appreciate the opportunity to identify trends and preoccupations in Morrison's work.)\n\nThat so much of the book is eerily timely doesn't mean that our only response is to mourn our meager progress over the past 40 years.

She insists on studying violin, although the nearest teacher is a two-hour drive over the mountains. She practices long hours and excels at school. Her Jewish, bi-racial high school boyfriend opens her eyes to the Northeast.\n\nAlthough her parents can't afford it, Hindman moves to New York for college.

But upon graduating, she can't get work as a Middle East war correspondent because Americans don't give a hoot about that part of the world. An internship at The New York Times turns out to be for a company that makes ad inserts. Work to develop an MTV show turns out to be a job exploiting pregnant teens.\n\nPost-graduation and unemployed, Hindman signs with The Composer for a national tour, \"playing\" before adoring crowds, appearing on PBS, traveling in a misery-inducing RV with a questionable driver. Vastly different geographies meld together from the sameness of corporate food and chain hotels. Reality recedes, and Hindman becomes increasingly dissociated from herself. She develops severe panic attacks that make her fear wetting herself on stage. Eventually she ends up in psychotherapy, her collapse clearly catastrophic, if not the centerpiece of the book.\n\nIt is Hindman's employment with The Composer that centers the book, while she crams in drama from the rest of her life as if she were stuffing batting in a pillow.

Hindman doesn't shrink from the big, systemic picture, but her fascinating personal story, with its unexpected twists, puts the memorable into this memoir.\n\nUltimately, Hindman diagnoses her problem: \"your utter desperation to succeed, your need to be loved by your superiors, no matter how ridiculous or ill- advised or fraudulent the thing was that they were asking you to do.\" Her closing message is both personal and universal: If you pick yourself up after every disappointment, shame, illness, and obstacle; and don't drown in pursuit of The Money, you'll land on your feet to sing about it.\n\nMartha Anne Toll is the Executive Director of the Butler Family Fund; her writing is at www.marthaannetoll.com, and she tweets at @marthaannetoll."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/13/693617293/american-spy-is-a-unique-spin-on-the-cold-war-thriller", "text": "'American Spy' Is A Unique Spin On The Cold War Thriller\n\nAmerican Spy by Lauren Wilkinson Hardcover, 292 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nOn the very first page of American Spy, narrator Marie Mitchell, a former FBI agent, hears a noise in her house. Deciding it's best to be cautious, she grabs her handgun, right before her worst fear is confirmed \u2014 a man with a gun enters her bedroom. There's a struggle; Marie ends up with a few broken blood vessels in her cheeks, and the stranger ends up with a bullet in his head.\n\nClearly, Lauren Wilkinson doesn't believe in wasting time. Her first novel starts off with a literal bang, and never once lets up. American Spy is a beautifully paced spy thriller as well as a promising debut from a writer who's not content to rely on the settled tropes of any literary genre.\n\nAmerican Spy is framed as a letter from Marie to her young twin sons, who are in the house at the time of their mother's attempted assassination. After the attack, she whisks the boys away to Martinique, the Caribbean island where her own mother lives. She knows her sons will one day wonder how their mother found herself in this situation; the letter is meant to address that: \"I'm writing this to give you honest answers to the questions I hazard to guess you'll ask while you're growing up. I'm writing it all down here just in case I'm not around to tell you.\"\n\nThe novel goes back and forth in time, alternating between Marie's upbringing in New York in the 1960s, her career as an FBI agent in the late '80s, and her retreat to Martinique in 1992. She and her beloved sister, Helene, were raised mostly by their police officer father; her mother had abandoned the family when the two girls were young.\n\nMarie decides to join the FBI out of college, influenced by her sister's lifelong dream of being a spy. Marie is good at her job, but is stymied in her attempts at career advancement by the white men in charge who are suspicious of her as a black woman. \"A sense of self-importance permeated the culture,\" Marie explains. \"So did machismo and knee-jerk conservatism. ... Very few of those men understood having no choice about whether they were political or not: Unlike me, they weren't people who'd had their existence politicized on their behalf.\"\n\nShe sees a possible way out of the bureau when a CIA officer recruits her to cozy up to Thomas Sankara, the leftist president of Burkina Faso, whose administration the American government is trying to overthrow. The CIA wants Marie to ascertain how much Sankara (a real-life figure) knows about America's involvement in his opposition, and possibly seduce him \u2014 Marie has misgivings, doubting the CIA's motives, but accepts the job anyway. She doesn't expect, however, to be charmed by the revolutionary politician: \"It wasn't enough to call what he had magnetism,\" she explains. \"The way he could make you feel. It was like he saw a version of you that was even more perfect than the version you saw of yourself. It was very generous. And it made you feel special, that reminder of your better angels.\"\n\nWilkinson packs a lot of plot into American Spy \u2014 Marie's mission is complicated by lingering questions about the mysterious death of her sister, whose close friend becomes her boss in the operation that takes her to Burkina Faso. But Wilkinson handles the several threads in the novel deftly, and she has a real gift for pacing \u2014 never once does the book flag or get bogged down, and it's never needlessly complex or confusing.\n\nWilkinson doesn't shy away from the moral ambiguity of American adventurism in the 1980s, and neither does her unforgettable narrator.\n\nShe also provides a unique spin on the Cold War spy thriller. There's no shortage of novels featuring the red-blooded American heroes trying to save the world from the dastardly Soviets, a well-worn trope that became a literary clich\u00e9 sometime in the 1960s. But American Spy is the opposite of that \u2014 Wilkinson doesn't shy away from the moral ambiguity of American adventurism in the 1980s, and neither does her unforgettable narrator, Marie, who tells her sons, \"One thing I can say for sure is that I don't want you to be moral absolutists. If what I'm telling you of our story means to you that the people it involves are either saved or damned, then you'll have misunderstood me.\"\n\nAmerican Spy works on so many levels \u2014 it's an expertly written spy thriller as well as a deeply intelligent literary novel that tackles issues of politics, race and gender in a way that's never even close to being heavy-handed or didactic. Above all, it's just so much fun to read \u2014 like the best of John le Carr\u00e9, it's extremely tough to put down. It marks the debut of an immensely talented writer who's refreshingly unafraid to take risks, and has the skills to make those risks pay off."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2019/02/21/696597105/gary-clark-jr-shows-impressive-musical-range-on-this-land", "text": "Gary Clark Jr. Shows Impressive Musical Range On 'This Land'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Frank Maddocks/Courtesy of the artist Frank Maddocks/Courtesy of the artist\n\nSet List \"Low Down Rolling Stone\"\n\n\"I Walk Alone\"\n\n\"Pearl Cadillac\"\n\nWe're thrilled to have Gary Clark Jr. on World Cafe today.

The first is Don Shirley, who was popular in the 1950s and 60s, both in person and on vinyl. The second is actor Mahershala Ali, who portrays Shirley in the film but does not play piano. And so, the third pianist is Kris Bowers, who does all the playing for Ali in the film.\n\nBowers recreated the music Don Shirley played just as Shirley, a jazz and classical virtuoso, played it. But on screen, you'd swear Ali was playing. The actor's tempo is perfect and his fingers hit all the right keys. Bowers says director Peter Farrelly insisted there be no edits the first time you see Ali at the piano in the film. On screen, the camera starts on Ali's hands and then slowly pans out to show his full body as he plays.\n\nBefore Green Book, Bowers says he had never heard of Don Shirley. Bowers immersed himself in Shirley's recordings. That made him nervous. \"I was pretty scared actually once I listened to it because of how intricate it was, how difficult it was,\" Bowers says.\n\nDon Shirley played jazz as if it were classical music. He played it as a fine art. There was no sheet music. But Bowers was no slouch at the piano \u2014 he trained at Julliard \u2014 so he could transcribe Shirley's performances then go over them over and over, learning as he listened.\n\n\"I probably almost broke down a few times questioning whether or not I was gonna be able to get it done,\" he remembers. \"I was practicing eight, nine hours a day.\"\n\nBut why didn't the filmmakers simply lip sync, or finger sync, Ali to the original Don Shirley LP?\n\n\"Those original recordings just have a lower quality to them,\" Bowers says. \"They're a little muddier. You would immediately recognize that this must be an old recording that we're listening to. So we wanted to re-record them so that it could just feel live.\"\n\nThat means Bowers had to teach Ali to actually appear to be playing. Bowers started with the basics.\n\n\"Our first lesson was only supposed to be an hour, and we spent three hours playing this major scale because he was so attentive to detail in a way that I had never really seen before. He just wanted to make sure that he got it as accurately as possible,\" Bowers says of Ali.\n\nAfter the first lesson, the actor could play a major scale with both hands. Bowers and Ali had lessons once a week for three months. By the second month, Ali was playing Shirley's complicated arrangements. You never hear him playing in the film, but you wouldn't know that from watching on screen. Bowers says Ali was a great student.\n\n\"When he knew that he was shooting a song, the day before, a few days before, he asked me to record video of myself playing through the song so he could watch me over and over and over again,\" Bowers says. \"After that, before we did the take, we set up a keyboard in his trailer and I would play for him over and over again just so he could sit across from me and watch. Then we were on stage when he was playing, and I was standing off in the wings doing air piano to show him where he should be.\"\n\nKris Bowers Plays Don Shirley Trio's \"Blue Skies\" 1:34\n\nAli mastered the choreography of playing so it looked authentic. But when it comes to making the music, its Bowers' hands viewers see playing the keys. In the edit room, Green Book's editors made Bowers hands look darker, similar to Ali's skin tone, through color correction. Bowers contributed other body parts, too.\n\n\"They did a combination of hands,\" he says. \"Sometimes it's my body and it's a head replacement. There are times where I actually am not sure if it's my hands or my body or his.\"\n\nBeing Green Book's ghost pianist has opened many doors for Bowers; lots of offers for TV and video games. At 29, he's doing exactly what he's wanted to do most of his life. In fact, Bowers was born to make music. In utero, his parents decided he would play piano, \"so they started finding piano sampler CDs and started to put them on my mom's stomach and played music for me.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2019/02/20/696226242/more-than-50-years-in-mavis-staples-is-still-delivering-messages-of-hope-and-jus", "text": "More Than 50 Years In, Mavis Staples Is Still Delivering Messages Of Hope And Justice\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chris Strong Photography/Courtesy of the artist Chris Strong Photography/Courtesy of the artist\n\nPlaylist \"I'll Take You There\" By The Staples Singers\n\n\"Slippery People\" By Mavis Staples\n\n\"Freedom Highway\" By The Staples Singers\n\n\"Why Am I Treated So Bad\" By The Staples Singers\n\n\"Touch A Hand\" By Mavis Staples\n\n\"You're Not Alone\" By Mavis Staples & Jeff Tweedy\n\n\"You're Not Alone\" By Mavis Staples\n\n\"Spanish Harlem\" By Aretha Franklin\n\n\"Dedicated\" By Mavis Staples\n\n\"Let's Do It Again\" By Mavis Staples\n\nMavis Staples is one of America's defining voices of freedom and peace.\n\nHer family's gospel group, The Staples Singers, led by her father Roebuck \"Pops\" Staples, marched with Dr. Martin Luther King and wrote songs like \"Freedom Highway\" and \"Why Am I Treated So Bad\" that provided part of the soundtrack of America's civil rights movement.\n\nMore than 50 years later, Mavis says things haven't changed that much. \"You know, this is supposed to be taken care of by now,\" she says. \"I shouldn't have to be singing protest songs and 'Freedom Highway' and you know, but I love it.\"\n\nAt nearly 80 years old, Mavis is still delivering messages about hope and justice.

Find more at NPR.org/Anthem.\n\nIt was February 1967, and 18-year-old Marine Pfc. Bill Ehrhart was days away from leaving for Vietnam. He had just enjoyed his last weekend off base, and his friends had offered to drive him back to Camp Pendleton, Calif., before sunrise.\n\n\"It was goodbye civilian world, next stop Vietnam,\" says Ehrhart, now a writer and poet.\n\nDuring their nighttime drive down the California coast, his friends turned on the radio \u2014 and that's when Ehrhart first heard it:\n\nThe radio was playing \"For What It's Worth\" by Buffalo Springfield, the folk-rock group led by Stephen Stills and Neil Young.\n\n\"I vividly remember thinking, 'Wow, what a cool song,' \" Ehrhart says. \"By the time I left the country, the anti-war movement was still very much a fringe movement, so I literally didn't understand what those guys were singing about.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nWhile it's often recognized as an anti-war protest anthem, \"For What It's Worth\" wasn't actually based on Vietnam. Stills, who wrote the song, was instead inspired by a confrontation back home that erupted on a few famous blocks in Los Angeles.\n\nLA's Sunset Strip was a world away from Vietnam: a crowded boulevard lined with billboards, dumpy music clubs and a diner packed with teenagers. In the 1960s, the area held the pulse of rock and roll counterculture \u2014 and it's where Buffalo Springfield made its name.\n\n\"It was like a carnival midway,\" says music photographer Henry Diltz, who used to hang around the Strip. \"Hundreds and hundreds of young kids, all dressed up in bell bottoms and tie-dyes, and they would come in and out of the clubs and walk up and down the street. It was kind of a happening.\"\n\nBut behind the vibrant nightlife, there was simmering tension. Owners of upscale restaurants and fancy storefronts complained that the hordes of teens were bad for business. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County Supervisor Ernest E. Debs wanted to construct a new freeway and turn the Sunset Strip into a financial district, according to the book Riot on Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood.\n\nIn an effort to clear out what Debs called the \"beatniks\" and \"wild-eyed kids,\" LA County began enforcing a 10 p.m. curfew for anyone under 18. In response, the youth scene turned into waves of teenage-led protests against law enforcement.\n\n\"These were not friendly neighborhood cops in a blue uniform,\" Diltz says. \"These were patrolmen with helmets and great big jackboots and billy clubs. It was kind of a scary scene in the midst of all that peace and love.\"\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Gary Strobl\n\nOn Nov. 12, 1966, a crowd of young people gathered outside a club called Pandora's Box to protest the \"disrespect and abuse of youths by police,\" as flyers distributed around the area described it. Hundreds of teens jammed the boulevard, some holding signs: \"Rights For Youth Too,\" \"Stop Blue Fascism,\" \"Leave Us Alone.\"\n\nPolice shouted back through bullhorns: \"Anyone under the age of 18 years old remaining in the area will be arrested.\" When demonstrators refused to leave at 10 p.m., the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and LAPD began their crackdown. The confrontation became known as the Sunset Strip Curfew Riots.\n\nA local KBLA disc jockey who went by the name Humble Harve broke format to take calls from listeners about \"the situation on the Sunset Strip.\" \"I've seen it,\" one caller told him on-air. \"I've seen the teenagers beaten \u2014 beaten \u2014 by the police.\"\n\nMichael Rummans, a local musician and Sunset Strip regular, says he still remembers how he was confronted the moment he pulled up to the scene: \"A cop came up to me, and he said, 'Get out of here right now or I'll drag you out of that car and kick the s*** out of you.' \"\n\n\"We decided not to leave,\" says Francie Zbilski, who was inside Pandora's Box with her boyfriend that night. \"We were all kind of prepared for the idea that we were going to be arrested.\" The club was usually a noisy scene with rowdy crowds and live music, but that night, she says, patrons were quiet. She could hear the commotion outside, and then came a loud bang on the door.\n\n\"I never saw so many policemen in my entire life,\" she says. \"We were just surrounded by police officers, like an army of them.\"\n\nZbilski says she was marched outside so they could check IDs. \"The cop behind me stuck a billy club in between my shoulder blades and gave me a good shove, which elicited me turning around and giving him the finger \u2014 because, you know, at 16 I was really brave,\" she says, laughing. \"I wouldn't do that now.\"\n\nDown the street, protesters had taken over a city bus. As police rushed to intervene, Zbilski slipped into the crowd.

Band manager Richard \"Dickie\" Davis was in the studio when Buffalo Springfield recorded the song.\n\n\"It was recorded in one night: vocals, overdubs, bass track, all that was done in one night,\" Davis says. For all that momentum, however, Stills was afraid of how the band might be typecast if the song did catch on.\n\n\"That name, 'For What It's Worth,' is the most 'aw, shucks' kind of name,\" Davis says. \"Like, 'Oh yeah, well, here's my opinion, you don't have to listen to it.' ... He was worried about it defining the group and he didn't want that to happen.\"\n\nBut it did: \"For What It's Worth\" became an enduring hit. Whether one hears it as about the Vietnam War or the Sunset Strip, the song was for the young people caught on the front lines.\n\n\"The song was about the times,\" Davis says. \"The protests for the Vietnam War were in play right then, and they were on Stephen's mind just as much as anything else. The song was written about the Sunset Strip, but it's bigger than that.\"\n\nThirteen months after he heard the song on his way back to base, Ehrhart returned from Vietnam. It wasn't the war he had expected. \"Within a few months of my arrival in Vietnam, I had realized, 'I don't know what's happening here, but it sure as heck isn't what Lyndon Johnson and my high school teachers told me was going on,' \" he says.\n\nAs anti-war demonstrations grew across the country, Ehrhart's politics gradually changed, too. The next time he heard Buffalo Springfield, \"For What It's Worth\" meant something else.\n\nThere's something happening here\n\nWhat it is ain't exactly clear\n\nThere's a man with a gun over there\n\nTelling me I got to beware\n\n\"I realized, hearing that song again \u2014 'Oh, wait a minute.

Cremona is the town where master luthier Antonio Stradivari crafted his storied instruments three centuries ago.\n\nBut there's no guarantee that his instrument's inimitable sound will survive for centuries more, says Fausto Cacciatori, the museum's chief conservator.\n\n\"What will these instruments sound like in 200 years? I hope they can still be played,\" he says. \"But you never know. All it takes is one unfortunate event. An earthquake, for instance. Think about what happened to so much art during World War II.\"\n\nCacciatori says Stradivarius instruments need a 21st century failsafe \u2014 and someone who understands music as well as technology to pull it off.\n\nEnter deejay Leonardo Tedeschi.\n\n\"We have played with Chemical Brothers, with a lot of big artists during our career,\" he muses.\n\nWhen he's not spinning records, Tedeschi runs Audiozone, a northern Italian sound engineering firm. And he had an idea: \"To bring the sound of Stradivari and make it accessible around the world,\" he says.\n\nThe idea came to him in 2014, when he wanted to mix the analog sounds of Stradivarius violins in some of his own electronic recordings, but discovered the elements he needed were lacking. That's when he reached out to the Violin Museum in Cremona, just a 45-minute drive from his native Piacenza, with a proposal.\n\nFirst, they would need to record Stradivarius instruments, and while they were at it, those of other master luthiers. Then they would have to save the recordings in a database that future composers could use to make their own music electronically.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Native Instruments Courtesy of Native Instruments\n\nThe Violin Museum, which was already concerned about preserving these sounds for future generations, agreed. It enlisted Lorenzi and four other world-class musicians from Italy and the Netherlands to play four prized instruments for posterity \u2014 the 1700 Antonio Stradivari \"Stauffer\" cello, the 1727 Antonio Stradivari \"Vesuvius\" violin, a 1615 \"Stauffer\" viola by Girolamo Amati, and the 1734 \"Prince Doria\" violin by Guarneri del Gesu\u0300.\n\nBut their task wouldn't be to record complete compositions. Rather, they would have to painstakingly record every possible note that can be played on each instrument.\n\n\"Every possible note, and even more difficult, every note transition,\" explains Tedeschi. \"From one note to all the other ones in the same string. It's a very complicated process, so there will be several hundred thousand files to be edited.\"\n\nIn the concert hall, Lorenzi, who is with the Italian Symphony Orchestra and has performed in the world's top concert halls, plucks the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C \u2014 \"do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do\" \u2014 on the Stradivarius violin. Then down the scale, until the engineers say they've got it.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Native Instruments Courtesy of Native Instruments\n\n\"There's something very meditative about it,\" he says. \"It takes a lot of mental and physical concentration. It's one of the most demanding things I've ever done.\"\n\nBut that meditative concentration is hard-won. Outside the museum, Tedeschi points out the thorn in his side.\n\nA rumble passes as a woman drags a suitcase across cobblestones. Then, the hiss of a street-sweeper machine. It's what you'd expect in a city of 70,000 people, with a bustling open-air market and a population of typically boisterous Italians.\n\nIf they're close enough to the concert hall, the noise they make is audible to the 32 hyper-sensitive microphones during recording \u2014 and potentially disastrous.\n\n\"Every time we hear this sound, the sound will mix with the frequency of our instruments, so we cannot use that sound in our product,\" Tedeschi laments.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Native Instruments Courtesy of Native Instruments\n\nAt the end of December, just before recording was set to begin, he went to the mayor of Cremona, Gianluca Galimberti, and asked for help. The mayor also happens to be president of the Antonio Stradivarius Violin Museum Foundation, charged with safeguarding and promoting the city's cherished legacy of stringed instrument-making.\n\n\"They needed silence around the museum of violins,\" says Galimberti. \"I think that we understood the importance of the project.\"\n\nThe mayor asked the people of Cremona to please keep it down, and blocked traffic around the concert hall during recordings from Jan. 7 to Feb. 9.\n\nOn a recent winter day, a security guard stands watch beside a metal barricade. He greets me with a cautious \"buongiorno\" as I tiptoe past him, into the quiet zone. The silence washes over me.\n\nTry as they might, it's impossible to block out all the sound all the time, says Thomas Koritke, the chief recording engineer inside the concert hall.\n\n\"You hear it. Let me just put this up, where they slam a car door outside,\" he says, as he plays back the recording of a scale played pizzicato on a viola.\n\nThe sound of the slamming door is barely audible \u2014 but there it is on the second pluck, enough to contaminate the recording and throw off the musicians.\n\nAfter playing for eight hours a day, six days a week, for five straight weeks, the musicians finally wrapped up earlier this month. It's a level of devotion Antonio Stradivari would likely have appreciated.

However, you can still listen with the Spotify and Apple Music playlists at the bottom of the page.\n\nIn the thoroughly collaborative bluegrass world, where musicians continually embark on new lineups and side projects with kindred pickers in their circles, it's hardly a given that a band would last a decade \u2014 especially one with a beginning as facetious as Della Mae's. Early on in the tenure of what was once the only string band on the circuit made up entirely of women, fiddle-playing founder Kimber Ludiker was often called upon to recount the group's origin story. In once such telling, she wrote, \"When I started this band, I started it actually as a joke. Late at night with a group of friends at a music camp in California, we were joking around about how fun it would be to start an all-female bluegrass band that played high-testosterone, really fast bluegrass music \u2014 what we called 'mangrass.'\"\n\nPre-order Della Mae's The Butcher Shoppe on Amazon and iTunes.\n\nThe hook wasn't merely that the women in the band would be playing instruments people were accustomed to seeing in the hands of men. It was also the chosen musical approach: They would perform with a virtuosic, hard-driving vigor presumed to be a masculine domain. (Recall that Alison Krauss, by far the biggest female star to emerge from a contemporary bluegrass background, has received far more recognition for applying ethereal refinement to her interpretations of sophisticated ballads than for displaying hearty mastery on fiddle.)\n\nWhen it came to actually hashing out the musical identity of Della Mae, Ludiker and founding mandolinist Jenni Lyn Gardner took a cue from what helped the foundational progressive bluegrass outfit New Grass Revival broaden its audience in the '80s: putting a blue-eyed soul singer out front, as opposed to a vocalist with a high-and-lonesome, rawboned attack. Celia Woodsmith, who'd cut her teeth in blues-rock, became Della Mae's lead singer, bringing with her sensual, theatrical grit.\n\nThose three and a revolving cast of additional members \u2014 who until fairly recently included guitarist Courtney Hartman \u2014 released three albums that blended bluegrass sensibilities with the stylistic permissiveness of Americana. The most recent, an accomplished self-titled 2015 set produced by alt-rock specialist Jacquire King, expanded on Appalachian hardiness with chamber-folk arrangements, singer-songwriter introspection, gently atmospheric studio effects and hopped-up blues melodies and rhythms.\n\nOn The Butcher Shoppe EP, its return to recording after a hiatus, Della Mae seems to have narrowed its priorities to one: showcasing its combination of playfulness and muscle as a performing unit. Producing themselves, Woodsmith, Gardner, Ludiker and current bassist Zoe Guigueno rolled through six songs in a little more than a day, two of them live favorites culled from the classic-rock and folk canons.\n\nFrom the opening lines of \"Sixteen Tons,\" the coal miner's lament traditionally delivered with a touch of wearied stoicism, Woodsmith's jazzy phrasing saunters behind the airily swinging time-keeping of touring guitarist Avril Smith. After a string of sly soloing on mandolin, guitar and banjo \u2014 banjo courtesy of esteemed guest Alison Brown \u2014 Woodsmith summons worldly-wise note bending and a guttural growl for the song's most tough-talking lines: \"I've got one fist of iron, and the next fist of steel / If the right one don't get you, then the left one will.\" \"Whipping Post,\" the Allman Brothers tune that laid out the template for blues-rock's epic, escalating spectacles of emotional suffering \u2014 a virile form of melodrama \u2014 is a chance for the group to build tension with a roiling groove and vamp with feverish precision, while Woodsmith attacks the familiar words lustily.\n\n\"Bourbon Hound\" is one of her compositions, a frolicsome ode to liquor with the zip of a western swing/rockabilly hybrid, while \"No-See-Um Stomp,\" a fiddle-led instrumental by Ludiker, hurtles from one shrewd, brisk solo to the next, eventually arriving at an inventive twin guitar passage, played by Avril and another guest, Molly Tuttle. The group dares to tackle \"Sleep With One Eye Open,\" a bluegrass standard from the Flatt & Scruggs catalog, with an energetic performance, through which Ludiker's improvised fiddle break slices through with a bracing, unexpected counterpoint to the melody. It may be a short recording, but the sort of musical wit and showmanship that can stir up crowds isn't in short supply.\n\nStream the Album"}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/695923867/first-listen-hand-habits-placeholder", "text": "Hand Habits Makes Its Most Fully-Realized Statement on 'Placeholder'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacob Boll/Courtesy of the artist Jacob Boll/Courtesy of the artist\n\nNote: NPR's First Listen audio comes down after the album is released.

Just the opposite, in fact: Recording as Hand Habits, Duffy pays scrupulous attention to detail in songs that function like intricate dioramas.\n\nOn placeholder, the singer (who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns) contemplates the fragility of human relationships and the hard-to-stomach reality that many of the people, experiences and places we've loved are only stepping stones on a journey of self-discovery.\n\n\"A big aspect of my songwriting and the way I move through the world depends on my relationships with people,\" Duffy writes in a statement about the album. \"The songs on placeholder are about accountability and forgiveness. I don't fictionalize much.\"\n\nAfter a string of bedroom demos made their way to Bandcamp in the early 2010s, Duffy became a fixture on a burgeoning Hudson Valley DIY scene alongside acts like Florist and Bellows. (Duffy was raised in Albany and attended college in Schenectady.) With momentum building, they chose to place Hand Habits on hold, leaving the Northeast for Los Angeles to play guitar with songwriter Kevin Morby's live band. After several years of touring, Duffy signed to indie label Woodsist and, in 2017, released Wildly Idle (Humble Before the Void), a tender, captivating solo debut.\n\nA gorgeous progression from Wildly Idle, placeholder captures Duffy's transfixing intimacy in elevated form. While their earlier work was entirely self-produced, placeholder was recorded at Justin Vernon's Wisconsin studio. Duffy's vocals find new confidence amid gentle guitar strumming and warbling pedal steel, blending into a haze of dreamlike Americana. These songs evoke waves of warm, pop-driven nostalgia, with equal doses of melancholy and optimism.\n\nThe album's title track captures the musings of someone scorned but not dejected.

However, you can still listen with the Spotify and Apple Music playlists at the bottom of the page.\n\nIf you listen closely to \"opus,\" the first song from Ryuichi Sakamoto's BTTB, it's possible to come away with a clear sense of the artist's creative bedrock; to hear a quiet heart beating and a deeply sensitive mind dreaming. It opens abruptly, a loose and plaintive waltz through the afternoon rain that pivots twice into the hopeful, idyllic refrain that also, whisperingly, closes it. Its influences are identifiable enough \u2014 classical (Erik Satie in particular) and jazz (and Japan's particular melodic inflection of it), with piercing, impressionistic notes that bisect its tranquility. It couldn't be anyone but Sakamoto.\n\nBTTB \u2014 \"back to the basics\" \u2014 was the composer's 14th studio album, an intimate collection of brief solo piano compositions that was first released in Japan in 1998. At the time he released the placid suite, Sakamoto was a long-established luminary, an immensely prolific and celebrated musician who'd won a BAFTA for his score to Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (in which he also co-starred, along with David Bowie), an Oscar for his score to The Last Emperor and a Golden Globe for his score to The Sheltering Sky. Prior to that, he'd formed the deeply influential trio Yellow Magic Orchestra in the late '70s alongside Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi.\n\nIn the liner notes that accompany BTTB's reissue, novelist and music obsessive Haruki Murakami writes that he listens to the album alone, during his early-morning routine, while preparing to work. It's hard, having heard BTTB and read Murakami's ruminative deployment of it, to imagine the record accompanying any other scene.\n\nThe standouts among BTTB's 18 tracks \u2014 \"lorenz and watson,\" \"chanson,\" \"aqua\" and \"reversing\" in particular \u2014 all pensively saunter and toy with negative space as pronounced as any of the piano's notes, with the distinct feeling of a master in a mode of deep play with his first instrument. Elsewhere, Sakamoto's experimental urges are irrepressible: \"do bacteria sleep?\" is a trippy, synthy jaw-harp excursion, while \"uetax\" is a composition written in prayerful water. The Yellow Magic Orchestra song \"tong poo\" is reinterpreted, shifting from a bass-heavy montage of wacky synth work into a frenetic, virtuosic performance.\n\nConsidering BTTB in the context of Sakamoto's previous album, a torrential orchestral suite compiled under the name Discord in 1997, is maybe helpful in understanding the dramatic serenity of its follow-up. With Discord \u2014 which is unavailable digitally \u2014 Sakamoto channeled his deep distress over Africa's dire sociopolitical climate into four movements: \"Grief,\" \"Anger,\" \"Prayer\" and \"Salvation.\" It's clear that Sakamoto put all of his emotional and creative energy into crafting Discord's dense, impassioned compositions; having completed it, the magnetic pull of a silent room and a single piano seems self-evident. Even BTTB's song lengths, which generally hover around four minutes, illustrate a desire to reorient, experiment and rediscover. Or maybe, instead of any artistic exhaustion, the album's approach was intended more to capitalize on a piece of music called \"energy flow,\" of which he composed 30 seconds for a commercial before it became an unlikely chart success, leading him to extend its run time to 4:33 on BTTB. The truth is probably somewhere in between.\n\n\"Some people think I'm film composer, some think I'm poppy musician, some think I'm avant-garde. Probably I have all inside,\" the maestro told SF Gate in 1997. On BTTB, he synthesized them all.\n\nStream the Album"}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/695924597/first-listen-teen-good-fruit", "text": "TEEN Dives Into the Gray Areas of Fading Love on 'Good Fruit'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist\n\nNote: NPR's First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify and Apple Music playlists at the bottom of the page.\n\nIn many ways, TEEN's 2016 album Love Yes could be viewed as a happy ending; as a culminating batch of songs about embracing love and commitment. Yet life barrels on long after any story concludes, and complications inevitably arise. That mindset materializes with the members of TEEN \u2014 drummer Katherine Lieberson and her sisters, multi-instrumentalists Teeny and Lizzie \u2014 on their fourth album, Good Fruit. The Nova Scotia-born, Brooklyn-based band describes the record as \"what happens after love fades.\" But Good Fruit delves deeper than a typical breakup album: In these 10 songs, TEEN explores the complexities and contradictions in love, loss and learning to leave the past behind.\n\nIn \"Only Water,\" Teeny processes grief after the death of their father, the composer Peter Lieberson. As she remembers saying goodbye, his absence functions as an intangible presence lingering over her as she sings, \"The last time I saw your face, yeah / You had aged so rapidly / A little piece of youth remained, yeah / And in youth, death does not hold proximity.\" In the climactic chorus, the song blooms into a soaring anthem celebrating life, as Teeny finds closure from the elemental and otherworldly forces that connect us after we're gone. \"If we're only only water, aren't we one in time?\" she sings atop a fluttering cascade of arpeggios and dance beats. Later, in the spare and warbling \"Radar,\" Lizzie recounts an unsettling, long-buried trauma that still stalks her memories years later. \"No lover can understand / I can barely say it out loud / It hibernates underneath my ribs / Stays there, gets cozy with my heart / Quiet, ashamed,\" she sings. \"A little girl knows when to run and hide / A little girl knows how to be small / A little girl knows when to close her eyes.\"\n\nElsewhere, Teeny scrutinizes the intertwined nature of love and lust (\"Ripe\"), escapes suffocating relationships that control her identity and ambition (\"Runner\"), and confronts manipulative men who foist limiting preconceptions and unattainable fantasies upon women (\"Putney\"). And in \"Pretend,\" Lizzie admits going through the motions when the hopeful luster of a partnership stagnates into regret: \"Why can't you love me like you said you would? / Why do I always feel misunderstood? / You and I can't pretend anymore.\"\n\nWhat makes these wrenching themes resonate is the way TEEN's music balances darkness with buoyancy and immediacy. Written and self-produced in Montreal and New York throughout 2017 \u2014 alongside longtime member Boshra AlSaadi (who's since left TEEN to focus on her own music) and frequent collaborator Miles Francis \u2014 the album represents another transformation in the band's infectious and artful pop. That's apparent in the bass-heavy grinding sequencers in \"Runner,\" as well as the pulsating synth textures and throbbing, dance-floor-ready beats in \"Luv 2 Luv.\" Fearless in its zigzagging arrangements and vibrant instrumentation, the group never shies away from showing its teeth, piercing through the blur of glistening keyboards with noisy electronic tones or chopped-up samples (\"Popular Taste\"). TEEN also knows when to pare down, giving moody, spacious songs like \"Pretend\" or \"Putney\" room to highlight the Liebersons' interwoven harmonies \u2014 a manifestation of the innate musical chemistry and intimacy the sisters share.\n\nThat collaboration also resides at the core of Good Fruit's centerpiece, \"Connection\" \u2014 a silky, slowly unfurling ballad in which each ruminates on the dynamics of companionship from differing viewpoints. First, Lizzie describes the contentment and calm that comes from a supportive partner. \"Being with you is all I need / How your presence brings me comfort / When I am with you I am at ease / And I'm no longer alone,\" she sings. \"A loving friend is all I need.\" Then, Teeny challenges the meaning and motives of connection and interdependence, asking aloud to herself, \"Is this the life you want to live?\" As a band that defines itself through constant searching, TEEN sounds most stirring when coupling upbeat and elated sounds with such unflinching honesty. For all its yearning and heartache, Good Fruit lands on a self-actualizing message about working through personal pain and coming out stronger on the other side.\n\nStream the Album"}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/20/696311512/the-women-behind-the-songs-ester-dean", "text": "The Women Behind The Songs: Ester Dean\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEster Dean's voice may be recognizable from her role as as Cynthia-Rose Adams in the Pitch Perfect movies and the animated films Ice Age and Rio, but that only scratches the surface of the Oklahoma native's work.

But that's how Dean got discovered by Tricky Stewart, a man behind some of the 21st Century's biggest pop hits. She cracked the Top 40 in 2009 with her own song \"Drop It Low,\" and started writing and demoing songs for major artists. Dean co-wrote the song \"What's My Name,\" which Rihanna took to No. 1 on Billboard's Top 100 chart in 2010.\n\nYouTube\n\nDean's voice is her instrument, and her musical gift is summoning melodic hooks. She's one of just a few \"top line\" writers. She goes into the studio and listens to instrumental tracks that are already completed, then she divines a melody and sings it over the music, over and over, until it feels like a hit.\n\nIn one way or another, Dean's been doing this all her life. In grade school, she kept paper notebooks filled with lyrical ideas, making up songs and singing to help her cope with life as the youngest of five kids being raised by a single mom. Now she keeps notes on her cell phone, pulling out bits of phrases and working them into the song. Fun, fearless and freethinking, Dean's vivacious personality comes across in her work.\n\nLooking at the credits of almost any contemporary pop song is kind of like reading the list of ingredients in processed food. But no matter how many people she's sharing the credit with, Dean is known for being a superb collaborator who can deal with big music industry egos. She knows when to take the lead in a session, and when help someone else turn their thoughts into a hit. Dean says that Katy Perry already had a concept and title for a song, but they volleyed ideas back and forth until \"Firework\" was born.\n\nYouTube\n\nDean says her songwriting is partly about fantasy, just like writing lines for an actor. Her lyrics aren't profound and they're not supposed to be. They're there to carry the melody and connect it to the rhythm, to create something so catchy that you can't get it out of your head, and to give you a three-minute escape from your daily grind."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2018/08/14/638483063/erykah-badu-tiny-desk-concert", "text": "Some folks around the NPR Music office said they felt an almost spiritual connection to Erykah Badu during her visit to the Tiny Desk.

We'll learn how female empowerment is thriving in the jazz community plus Miller's firsthand experiences with sexism and gender inequality in our institutions and on the scene.\n\nAnd we'll consider how it all connects: melody and harmony, the individual and the whole. \"There's something about the platform of jazz,\" Miller says, \"that it lays this palette of having such deep communication with your other bandmates. And for me that's why I play this music.\""}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2016/12/07/504595430/lucinda-williams-live-in-concert", "text": "The fire and feel Lucinda Williams brought to the Lincoln Center stage when she headlined this August concert is informed by 25 years of making music. Deeply informed by tradition, her work remains determinedly individualistic and envelope-pushing.\n\nIn musical dialogue with her longtime guitarist, Stuart Mathis, Williams pulled evocative pages from her big songbook, going back to 2003 for the soul-stirring \"Fruits Of My Labor\" while showing her continued currency with recent selections like the empathetic character study \"West Memphis\" and the soaring, attitudinal \"Foolishness.\"\n\nWilliams made no bones about her progressive politics while vamping through \"Foolishness\" like Americana's own version of Nina Simone. Mathis answered her improvisations with slicing guitar lines of his own. It never took long for Williams to transform the night's mood from quietude to fervor. Then she exited, inimitable spirit intact.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Fruits Of My Labor\"\n\n\"West Memphis\"\n\n\"Foolishness\"\n\nCREDITS\n\nEvent Producer: Saidah Blount; Producers: Ann Powers, Mito Habe-Evans, Colin Marshall; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Concert Video Director: Colin Marshall; Production Assistant: Brandi Fullwood; Concert Videographers: Kevin Chiu, Chris Farber, Nickolai Hammar, Niki Walker; Editor: Nicole Conflenti; Special Thanks: Lincoln Center; Executive Producer: Anya Grundmann."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "https://www.npr.org/music/radio", "text": "A mix of old favorites and new music from NPR's All Songs Considered.\n\nrock KEXP Dedicated to music and discovery, from indie rock to Afropop.\n\nfunk Purple Current Exploring the musical legacy of Prince and beyond.\n\nr&b I'll Take You There Everything from early doo-wop to contemporary slow jams."}, {"source": "npr", "url": "http://www.npr.org/2014/02/10/271548963/ill-take-you-there-r-b-from-npr-music", "text": "I'll Take You There: R&B From NPR Music\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Al Pereira/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Al Pereira/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n\"I'll Take You There\" is a 24/7 R&B and soul channel from NPR Music. Curated and hosted by Jason King of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, the playlist runs the gamut from the genre's origins in the 1940s to today's slow jam stunners.

Rhythm and blues is about getting up to get down to get on the good foot to get happy and enjoy yourself when the suffering hits, when the blues wants to envelop you like a fog.\n\nIn the 1940s, R&B was the marketing term journalist-turned-Atlantic Records-producer Jerry Wexler coined to describe the raucous and jumpy sounds African-Americans were concocting in urban hotspots like New Orleans; it was a newfangled phrase to lift black music from the racist connotation of \"race music.\" Rhythm and blues was '40s shouters like Wynonie Harris hollering over tight, post-swing rhythm combos \u2014 it was three-dimensional bass lines bouncing around driving beats and spastic saxophones honking like farm pigs.\n\nBy the '50s, white folks repackaged the music as rock 'n' roll, but it wasn't long before R&B sprouted new arms, extending itself into the gospelized frenzy of soul, the stairstep harmonies of doo-wop, the cool crossover pop of Motown, the hot circular grooves of funk in the '60s, the boudoir hush of quiet storm and the aspirational sleekness of disco in the '70s. But R&B also left its trace on Jamaican reggae, Nigerian afrobeat, Ghanaian highlife, Chicago and Detroit house, not to mention '80s boogie, synth-funk and hi-NRG, and all those British post-Northern-soul variants. Contrary to popular wisdom, the rise of drum machines and samplers in the '80s and '90s never killed R&B: the music only mutated, reformed, transmogrified and got itself a brand new bag in the form of new jack swing, hip-hop-soul, neo-soul, broken beat and drum 'n' bass. The energy never dies.\n\nAt its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways.\n\nWhat links R&B across all that space and time is its emphasis on dance, sex and romance. At its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways. It's about being overjoyed and underpaid and living for the weekend and turning your house into a home. It's the music of picket lines and picket signs, of sin and salvation, of hustles, twists and Soul Trains. It's the soundtrack of cities being burned by riots, of communities struggling to be free, of people darker than blue saying it loud and proud to be right on and free. It's the music of corner bars and shabeens and dancehalls and supermarkets and bathhouses and weddings and barbecues and family reunions. It's happy feelings and silent tears, hot grits and raining men, tempestuous telephone calls and profound pillow talk. It's feel-deep music, vibration and frequency meant to resonate in the marrow of your bones and the cells of your blood.\n\nI've curated a 24/7 stream of thousands of songs for NPR that reflect the vast range of what R&B was and what it is and where it's going. You're likely to hear anything from Aretha Franklin to Little Richard to Sylvester to Jodeci to Ruth Brown to IG Culture to Carl Hall to Disclosure to Dinah Washingtonto Roy Ayers to Kelela to The Righteous Brothers to Jorge Ben to Amos Milburn to Jeff Buckley to Louis Jordan.
